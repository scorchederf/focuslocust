_body: "---\ndescription: Hooking, Credential Stealing\n---\n\n# Intercepting Logon Credentials by Hooking msv1\\_0!SpAcceptCredentials\n\
  \nThis lab was inspired by [@\\_xpn\\_](https://twitter.com/\\_xpn\\_) and his great post [https://blog.xpnsec.com/exploring-mimikatz-part-2/](https://blog.xpnsec.com/exploring-mimikatz-part-2/)\
  \ - definitely go read it if you haven't.\n\nIn this lab I am going to write a simple DLL that, when injected into lsass.exe,\
  \ will install a hook for `msv1_0.SpAcceptCredentials` routine, intercept logon credentials and write them out to disk.\n\
  \nThe purpose of this lab was for me to play around with:\n\n* API hooking + intercepting logon credentials\n* Programatically\
  \ searching process memory space for byte patterns\n* Ghidra / WinDBG\n\n{% hint style=\"warning\" %}\nNot an OPSEC safe\
  \ technique. Can be flagged for at least the following:\n\n* LSASS loading unusual DLLs\n* `WriteProcessMemory` API usage\n\
  {% endhint %}\n\n## Overview\n\nBelow is a high level overview of the lab and technique implementation:\n\n* LSASS has the\
  \ [`MSV1_0.DLL`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthn/msv1-0-authentication-package) Authentication Package\
  \ module loaded in its memory space\n* MSV1\\_0.dll is responsible for handling interactive logons\n* `SpAcceptCredentials`\
  \ inside MSV1\\_0.dll is called by the system when a user successfully authenticates interactively (i.e logon types 2, 10)\n\
  * `SpAcceptCredentials` is passed clear text credentials\n* If we can hook the `SpAcceptCredentials`, we can intercept those\
  \ credentials\n* `SpAcceptCredentials` is not an exported function in the MSV1\\_0.dll, so we cannot use `GetProcAddress`\
  \ to find its location in lsass process memory\n* In order to find `SpAcceptCredentials` in memory, we will need to:&#x20;\n\
  \  * signature it\n  * scan lsass.exe memory space (actually, for simplicity, just the range of `msv1_0.baseOfImage - msv1_0.sizeOfImage`)\
  \ for that signature\n* Once `SpAcceptCredentials` signature is found, we will hook it by redirecting the original `SpAcceptCredentials`\
  \ to our rogue function `hookedSpAccecptedCredentials`\n* `hookedSpAccecptedCredentials`, once called, will:\n  1. Intercept\
  \ the logon credentials and write them out to disk\n  2. Unhook `SpAcceptCredentials`, so that the original `SpAcceptCredentials`\
  \ can be called later, so that a user can successfully authenticate and get its logon session created without crashing lsass.exe\n\
  \  3. Reinstall the hook `hookedSpAccecptedCredentials` by starting a new thread that will execute with a delay of a couple\
  \ of seconds. Delay is there to allow for the original `SpAcceptCredentials` to finish executing before it gets patched\
  \ again, otherwise we would end up in a never ending cycle where `SpAcceptCredentials` would be jump to `hookedSpAccecptedCredentials`\
  \ and `hookedSpAccecptedCredentials` would call `SpAcceptCredentials` as required in the step 4\n  4. Call the original\
  \ `SpAcceptCredentials` with intercepted credentials so that the system can complete the user authentication / logon session\
  \ creation successfully\n\n## Loading msv1\\_0 Debugging Symbols\n\nFirst of, let's see if we can hit the breakpoint on\
  \ `msv1_0!SpAcceptCredentials`. For this, let's jump WinDBG and sort load the symbols for msv1\\_0 module if they are missing.\n\
  \nLet's find the `EPROCESS` structure for the lsass.exe:\n\n```\n!process 0 0 lsass.exe\n```\n\n![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image\
  \ (450).png>)\n\nWe can now switch the WinDBG to lsass.exe process's context:\n\n```\n.process /i /p /r ffffda8291281080\n\
  ```\n\n![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (451).png>)\n\nListing modules loaded by lsass with command `lm` shows that we do\
  \ not have symbols for msv1\\_0.dll loaded:\n\n![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (452).png>)\n\n...although the module itself\
  \ is loaded:\n\n![Note that addresses differ due to a reboot](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (455).png>)\n\nLet's load the\
  \ missing symbols:\n\n```\n.reload /f /i msv1_0.dll\nlm\n```\n\nWe can confirm the symbols are now loaded:\n\n![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image\
  \ (453).png>)\n\nLet's now set a breakpoint for `msv1_0!SpAcceptCredentials`:\n\n```\nbp msv1_0!SpAcceptCredentials\n```\n\
  \n![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (454).png>)\n\nFinally, let's see if we can hit the breakpoint by trying to authenticate\
  \ for a new logon session with a `runas` command:\n\n![](../../.gitbook/assets/msv1\\_0-spacceptcredentials-breakpoint.gif)\n\
  \nWhile we are at it, let's take a look at the start of the `msv1_0!SpAcceptCredentials` routine before we patch it later\
  \ - we will be replacing the first 12 bytes (mov rax + 8 byte address to hookedSpAccecptedCredentials routine + jmp rax)\
  \ of this routine with a jump to our `hookedSpAccecptedCredentials` routine, that will be intercepting any new credentials\
  \ passed to it:\n\n![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (458).png>)\n\n## Inspecting `SpAcceptCredentials` Arguments\n\nOnce\
  \ the breakpoint is hit, we can inspect what arguments the `SpAcceptCredentials` was called with.\n\nConsidering that we\
  \ know the following:\n\n* On x64, Win APIs use a `fastcall` calling convention - the first 4 function arguments are passed\
  \ via registers\n* Prototype of the [`SpAcceptCredentials`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/ntsecpkg/nc-ntsecpkg-spacceptcredentialsfn)\
  \ - it accepts 4 arguments\n* Members of the [~~`PSECPKG_PRIMARY_CRED`~~](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/ntsecpkg/ns-ntsecpkg-secpkg\\\
  _primary\\_cred) structure. We are interested in the following:\n  * Password - contains a plaintext password\n  * Domain\
  \ name\n  * DownLevelName - user name\n\n...we can now inspect the values and structures passed as shown below:&#x20;\n\n\
  ![PSECPKG\\_PRIMARY\\_CRED structure and SpAcceptCredentials prototype](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (449).png>)\n\nNote\
  \ how we can identify the username `spotless`, domain name - `WS02` (my local machine name in this case) and the password\
  \ in plaintext `123456`.\n\n```erlang\n// db r8; dS r8+8; dS r8+8+10; dS r8+8+10+10\n\nmsv1_0!SpAcceptCredentials:\n0033:00007ffb`95255330\

  \ dS r8+8+10+10\n0000015d`388f79b0  \"123456\"\n```\n\nAdditionally, below shows that the value contained in the register\
  \ `r8` holds a new logon session id that was created as part of a successful authentication via `runas` command:\n\n![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image\
  \ (438).png>)\n\n## Signaturing `SpAcceptCredentials`&#x20;\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the `SpAcceptCredentials`is not exported\
  \ in the `msv1_0` DLL, so we cannot use Windows APIs to resolve its address in memory, therefore we need to find it ourselves\
  \ by scanning the lsass process memory space.\n\nIn order to do it, we need to find a sequence of bytes in the `SpAcceptCredentials`\
  \ routine, that uniquely identifies it. Per [mimikatz's](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz) source code, we can use\
  \ the following bytes for our signature:\n\n```c\n48 83 ec 20 49 8b d9 49 8b f8 8b f1 48\n```\n\n{% hint style=\"info\"\
  \ %}\nMy msv1\\_0.dll is from x64 Windows 10, 1809\n{% endhint %}\n\nIf we check the `msv1_0.dll` in Ghidra, we indeed find\
  \ our signature - 16 bytes into the `SpAcceptCredentials` function start:\n\n![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (437).png>)\n\
  \nWe can also confirm the bytes are present when `SpAcceptCredentials` breakpoint is hit, as expected:\n\n![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image\
  \ (460).png>)\n\nWe will pass this signature later to our memory hunting routine `GetPatternMemoryAddress(..., signature,\
  \ ...)` in our DLL, that will be injected into the lsass where it will identify the memory address of `SpAcceptCredentials`\
  \ routine inside the lsass.exe process:\n\n![The signature will be passed on to the routine GetPatternMemoryAddress ](<../../.gitbook/assets/image\
  \ (463).png>)\n\n## HUH - Hooking: Under the Hood\n\nBefore we start looking under the hood of lsass.exe, there are a couple\
  \ of other things to note.\n\nOur compiled and injected DLL will immediately call `installSpAccecptedCredentialsHook` once\
  \ lsass.exe loads our malicious DLL with `LoadLibrary`:\n\n![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (465).png>)\n\n`installSpAccecptedCredentialsHook`\
  \ will:\n\n* wait for 5 seconds before proceeding - as explained earlier - this allows the original `SpAccecptedCredentials`\
  \ to be called and finish its execution, before it gets patched again\n* find `SpAccecptedCredentials` memory address based\
  \ on the signature discussed earlier - lines 85-86 in the below screenshot\n* read and store the first 12 bytes of `SpAccecptedCredentials`\
  \ in memory - these bytes will be used to restore the function to its original state / unpatch it - line 89\n* overwrite\
  \ the first 12 bytes of `SpAccecptedCredentials` with a jump to our rogue function `hookedSpAccecptedCredentials` that will\
  \ intercept any new user logon credentials - line 92-95\n\n![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (466).png>)\n\nAssuming we've\
  \ compiled the DLL, let's inject it into lsass. I will simply inject it with Process Hacker:\n\n![](../../.gitbook/assets/msv1\\\
  _0-spacceptcredentials-hooking.gif)\n\nLet's now have a quick look inside the lsass.exe via WinDBG when `msv1_0!SpAcceptCredentials`\
  \ is called.&#x20;\n\nIf we break into lsass, we will see that our module `memssp-dll.dll` is now loaded - line 23:\n\n\

  ```\n\n![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (464).png>)\n\nIf we disassemble `msv1_0!SpAcceptCredentials`, we will notice that\
  \ the first few bytes of the routine are now different, compared to those we saw earlier before the DLL injection - this\
  \ confirms the hook was installed:\n\n![routine start before and after the hook was installed](<../../.gitbook/assets/image\
  \ (467).png>)\n\nThe first instructions of the hooked function now are:\n\n![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (468).png>)\n\
  \nThese instructions came from the below code in our DLL.&#x20;\n\n`mov rax` instruction, where rax is the address of our\
  \ `hookedSpAccecptedCredentials`:\n\n![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (471).png>)\n\nand `jmp rax`:\n\n![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image\
  \ (472).png>)\n\nNow, if we remember that our malicious module's `memssp-dll.dll` base address was `7FF9CB391000h` and its\
  \ size was `5e2cbfd1`, it means that our module is mapped in the range `[7FF9CB391000h, 7FF9CB391000+5e2cbfd1]` => ``[0x7FF9CB391000,\
  \ 0x00007ffa`2965cfd1]``:\n\n![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (469).png>)\n\nThis means that `7FF9CB391000h` as seen in\
  \ the first instruction of the hooked `SpAcceptCredentials` routine, is part of our malicious module since it falls in the\
  \ range ``[0x7FF9CB391000, 0x00007ffa`2965cfd1]``:\n\n![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (470).png>)\n\nMoving forward - note\
  \ that after the trampoline to our rogue function, I've set the breakpoint on instruction `rbx, r9` at `7ff9b6955344`:\n\
  \n![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (473).png>)\n\nIf we hit the breakpoint `msv1_0!SpAcceptCredentials` and and continue\
  \ running, we immediately hit that second breakpoint at `7ff9b6955344`, however, note that our trampoline `mov rax, jmp\
  \ rax` is now gone:\n\n![](../../.gitbook/assets/msv1\\_0-spacceptcredentials-unhooking.gif)\n\nThis is because `hookedSpAccecptedCredentials`\
  \ (previously stored in rax) unhooked `SpAccecptedCredentials` by writing back 12 original bytes of `SpAccecptedCredentials`\
  \ before it was hooked, to the start of `SpAccecptedCredentials` (orange) and redirected the code back to the start of `SpAccecptedCredentials`\
  \ (lime), so that a new user logon session can be created:\n\n![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (475).png>)\n\nHighlighted\
  \ in blue is the code that actually intercepts the credentials and writes them to disk. Code in white is responsible for\
  \ re-hooking the `SpAccecptedCredentials` in a new delayed thread, so that the `originalSpAcceptCredentials` can finish\
  \ executing without crashing the system.\n\n## Demo\n\nBelow shows how user `spotless` on a machine `WS02` authenticates\
  \ successfully and its credentials are written to `c:\\temp\\credentials.txt`:\n\n![](../../.gitbook/assets/msv1\\_0-spacceptcredentials.gif)\n\
  \nNote that msv1\\_0 exports a function `LsaApLogonUserEx2` that we could have hooked to intercept credentials since it\
  \ is also passed a structure `PSECPKG_PRIMARY_CRED` when a user  attempts to authenticate. This lab, however, was focused\
  \ on the exercise of finding the required function address by scanning the target process memory rather than resolving it\
  \ via Windows APIs:\n\n![](../../.gitbook/assets/LsaApLogonUserEx2.gif)\n\n## SymFromName\n\nIt's possible to resolve the\
  \ `SpAcceptCredentials` function address if we have access to debugging symbols like so:\n\n```cpp\nHMODULE targetModule\
  \ = LoadLibraryA(\"msv1_0.dll\");\nPCSTR symbolName = \"msv1_0!SpAcceptCredentials\";\nULONG64 buffer[(sizeof(SYMBOL_INFO)\
  \ + MAX_SYM_NAME * sizeof(TCHAR) + sizeof(ULONG64) - 1) /\tsizeof(ULONG64)] = {};\nPSYMBOL_INFO symbol = (PSYMBOL_INFO)buffer;\n\
  symbol->SizeOfStruct = sizeof(SYMBOL_INFO);\nsymbol->MaxNameLen = MAX_SYM_NAME;\nSymSetOptions(SYMOPT_EXACT_SYMBOLS);\n\
  SymInitialize(GetCurrentProcess(), \"C:\\\\programdata\\\\dbg\\\\sym\", TRUE);\nSymFromName(GetCurrentProcess(), symbolName,\
  \ symbol);\n```\n\n![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (484).png>)\n\n## Code\n\n{% code title=\"SpAcceptCredentialsHook.dll\"\
