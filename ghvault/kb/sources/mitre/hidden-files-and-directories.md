description: 'Adversaries may set files and directories to be hidden to evade detection mechanisms. To prevent normal users
  from accidentally changing special files on a system, most operating systems have the concept of a ‘hidden’ file. These
  files don’t show up when a user browses the file system with a GUI or when using normal commands on the command line. Users
  must explicitly ask to show the hidden files either via a series of Graphical User Interface (GUI) prompts or with command
  line switches (<code>dir /a</code> for Windows and <code>ls –a</code> for Linux and macOS).


  On Linux and Mac, users can mark specific files as hidden simply by putting a “.” as the first character in the file or
  folder name  (Citation: Sofacy Komplex Trojan) (Citation: Antiquated Mac Malware). Files and folders that start with a period,
  ‘.’, are by default hidden from being viewed in the Finder application and standard command-line utilities like “ls”. Users
  must specifically change settings to have these files viewable.


  Files on macOS can also be marked with the UF_HIDDEN flag which prevents them from being seen in Finder.app, but still allows
  them to be seen in Terminal.app (Citation: WireLurker). On Windows, users can mark specific files as hidden by using the
  attrib.exe binary. Many applications create these hidden files and folders to store information so that it doesn’t clutter
  up the user’s workspace. For example, SSH utilities create a .ssh folder that’s hidden and contains the user’s known hosts
  and keys.


  Additionally, adversaries may name files in a manner that would allow the file to be hidden such as naming a file only a
  “space” character.


  Adversaries can use this to their advantage to hide files and folders anywhere on the system and evading a typical user
  or system analysis that does not incorporate investigation of hidden files.'
