description: 'Adversaries may obtain and abuse credentials of existing accounts as a means of gaining Initial Access, Persistence,
  Privilege Escalation, or Defense Evasion. Compromised credentials may be used to bypass access controls placed on various
  resources on systems within the network and may even be used for persistent access to remote systems and externally available
  services, such as VPNs, Outlook Web Access, network devices, and remote desktop.(Citation: volexity_0day_sophos_FW) Compromised
  credentials may also grant an adversary increased privilege to specific systems or access to restricted areas of the network.
  Adversaries may choose not to use malware or tools in conjunction with the legitimate access those credentials provide to
  make it harder to detect their presence.


  In some cases, adversaries may abuse inactive accounts: for example, those belonging to individuals who are no longer part
  of an organization. Using these accounts may allow the adversary to evade detection, as the original account user will not
  be present to identify any anomalous activity taking place on their account.(Citation: CISA MFA PrintNightmare)


  The overlap of permissions for local, domain, and cloud accounts across a network of systems is of concern because the adversary
  may be able to pivot across accounts and systems to reach a high level of access (i.e., domain or enterprise administrator)
  to bypass access controls set within the enterprise.(Citation: TechNet Credential Theft)'
