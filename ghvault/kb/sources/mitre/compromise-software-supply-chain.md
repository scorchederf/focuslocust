description: 'Adversaries may manipulate application software prior to receipt by a final consumer for the purpose of data
  or system compromise. Supply chain compromise of software can take place in a number of ways, including manipulation of
  the application source code, manipulation of the update/distribution mechanism for that software, or replacing compiled
  releases with a modified version.


  Targeting may be specific to a desired victim set or may be distributed to a broad set of consumers but only move on to
  additional tactics on specific victims.(Citation: Avast CCleaner3 2018)(Citation: Command Five SK 2011)  '
