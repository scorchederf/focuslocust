description: "Adversaries may tunnel network communications to and from a victim system within a separate protocol to avoid\
  \ detection/network filtering and/or enable access to otherwise unreachable systems. Tunneling involves explicitly encapsulating\
  \ a protocol within another. This behavior may conceal malicious traffic by blending in with existing traffic and/or provide\
  \ an outer layer of encryption (similar to a VPN). Tunneling could also enable routing of network packets that would otherwise\
  \ not reach their intended destination, such as SMB, RDP, or other traffic that would be filtered by network appliances\
  \ or not routed over the Internet. \n\nThere are various means to encapsulate a protocol within another protocol. For example,\
  \ adversaries may perform SSH tunneling (also known as SSH port forwarding), which involves forwarding arbitrary data over\
  \ an encrypted SSH tunnel.(Citation: SSH Tunneling)(Citation: Sygnia Abyss Locker 2025) \n\n[Protocol Tunneling](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1572)\
  \ may also be abused by adversaries during [Dynamic Resolution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1568). Known as DNS\
  \ over HTTPS (DoH), queries to resolve C2 infrastructure may be encapsulated within encrypted HTTPS packets.(Citation: BleepingComp\
  \ Godlua JUL19) \n\nAdversaries may also leverage [Protocol Tunneling](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1572) in conjunction\
  \ with [Proxy](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1090) and/or [Protocol or Service Impersonation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1001/003)\
  \ to further conceal C2 communications and infrastructure. "
