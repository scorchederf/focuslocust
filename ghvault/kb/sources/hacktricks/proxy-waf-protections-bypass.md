  \ id=\"heading-bypassing-aws-waf-acl\"></a>\n\n### Path Confusion\n\n[**In this post**](https://blog.sicuranext.com/modsecurity-path-confusion-bugs-bypass/)\
  \ is explained that ModSecurity v3 (until 3.0.12), **improperly implemented the `REQUEST_FILENAME`** variable which was\
  \ supposed to contain the accessed path (until the start of the parameters). This is because it performed an URL decode\
  \ to get the path.\\\nTherefore, a request like `http://example.com/foo%3f';alert(1);foo=` in mod security will suppose\
  \ that the path is just `/foo` because `%3f` is transformed into `?` ending the URL path, but actually the path that a server\
  \ will receive will be `/foo%3f';alert(1);foo=`.\n\nThe variables `REQUEST_BASENAME` and `PATH_INFO` were also affected\
  \ by this bug.\n\nSomething similar ocurred in version 2 of Mod Security that allowed to bypass a protection that prevented\
  \ user accessing files with specific extensions related to backup files (such as `.bak`) simply by sending the dot URL encoded\
  \ in `%2e`, for example: `https://example.com/backup%2ebak`.\n\n## Bypass AWS WAF ACL <a href=\"#heading-bypassing-aws-waf-acl\"\
  \ id=\"heading-bypassing-aws-waf-acl\"></a>\n\n### Malformed Header\n\n[This research](https://rafa.hashnode.dev/exploiting-http-parsers-inconsistencies)\
  \ mentions that it was possible to bypass AWS WAF rules applied over HTTP headers by sending a \"malformed\" header that\
  \ wasn't properly parsed by AWS but it was by the backend server.\n\nFor example, sending the following request with a SQL\
  \ injection in the header X-Query:\n\n```http\nGET / HTTP/1.1\\r\\n\nHost: target.com\\r\\n\nX-Query: Value\\r\\n\n\\t'\
  \ or '1'='1' -- \\r\\n\nConnection: close\\r\\n\n\\r\\n\n```\n\nIt was possible to bypass AWS WAF because it wouldn't understand\
  \ that the next line is part of the value of the header while the NODEJS server did (this was fixed).\n\n## Multipart /\
  \ parser-differential WAF bypasses\n\nSome emergency WAF rules for parser-driven bugs try to **parse `multipart/form-data`\
  \ themselves** and then scan only the reconstructed fields. This is fragile: if the WAF and the backend do **not** implement\
  \ the **same grammar**, the WAF can inspect a harmless interpretation while the backend rebuilds the real payload. Treat\
  \ this as a **grammar un-equivalence** problem, not as pure signature evasion.\n\nThis is especially relevant in exploit\
  \ chains such as **React2Shell**, where the malicious server-side object graph can stay unchanged while only the **HTTP\
  \ transport syntax** is mutated until the WAF and the origin disagree.\n\n### High-value parser differential checks\n\n\
  - **Top-level `Content-Type` parsing**: duplicate `boundary=` parameters, quoted vs unquoted values, spaces, escapes, RFC\
  \ 5987 parameters, multiple `Content-Type` headers, case sensitivity, invalid/non-UTF8 bytes.\n- **Multipart framing**:\
  \ garbage before/after the first boundary, `\\r\\n` vs `\\n`, large body handling, duplicate field names, malformed closing\
  \ markers such as ``--boundary-- ``.\n- **Per-part headers**: duplicate `Content-Type`, `Content-Disposition` quirks (`filename`,\
  \ `filename*=`), per-part charsets such as `utf16le` / `ucs2`, duplicate sub-headers, `Content-Transfer-Encoding`.\n\n###\
  \ Exploitable patterns\n\n- **Duplicate parameter precedence mismatch**: if the WAF uses the last `boundary=` but the backend\
  \ uses the first one, the WAF can parse an empty body while the backend parses the attacker-controlled parts.\n- **Fail-open\
  \ parser errors**: if malformed headers or invalid octets make the WAF parser error and the request is still forwarded,\
  \ inspection is effectively disabled.\n- **Per-part charset decoding gaps**: if the backend honors `Content-Type: text/plain;\
  \ charset=utf16le` (or `ucs2`) inside a multipart part while the WAF scans raw bytes, blocked markers such as `:constructor`\
  \ can be hidden in the encoded body. `busboy`, for example, maps `utf16le` / `ucs2` to a UTF-16 decoder.\n- **Duplicate\
  \ multipart sub-headers**: duplicated `Content-Type` headers inside the same part can create a second precedence mismatch\
  \ where the WAF sees `charset=utf8` but the backend honors the first `charset=utf16le`.\n- **Boundary termination quirks**:\
  \ if the WAF accepts `--boundary-- ` as the final marker but the backend rejects the trailing whitespace, the WAF stops\
  \ scanning too early and the backend keeps parsing later parts.\n\n### Testing workflow\n\n1. Find or build an endpoint\
  \ that shows how the **backend parser** reconstructed each multipart field.\n2. Keep the **backend payload** identical and\
  \ mutate only the **transport grammar**.\n3. Diff the WAF decision against backend parsing while fuzzing duplicate parameters,\
  \ duplicate headers, malformed octets, part charsets, and closing-boundary syntax.\n4. Treat **parse error => allow** as\
  \ a critical finding and validate first with safe marker strings before replaying the real exploit payload.\n\nThese ambiguities\
  \ often overlap with:\n\n{{#ref}}\nhttp-request-smuggling/README.md\n{{#endref}}\n\n{{#ref}}\nfile-upload/README.md\n{{#endref}}\n\
  \n## Generic WAF bypasses\n\n### Request Size Limits\n\nCommonly WAFs have a certain length limit of requests to check and\
  \ if a POST/PUT/PATCH request is over it, the WAF won't check the request.\n\n- For AWS WAF, you can [**check the documentation**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/limits.html)**:**\n\
  \n<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width=\"687\"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Maximum size of a web\
  \ request body that can be inspected for Application Load Balancer and AWS AppSync protections</td><td>8 KB</td></tr><tr><td>Maximum\
  \ size of a web request body that can be inspected for CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified\
  \ Access protections**</td><td>64 KB</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n- From [**Azure docs**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/web-application-firewall/ag/application-gateway-waf-request-size-limits)**:**\n\
  \nOlder Web Application Firewalls with Core Rule Set 3.1 (or lower) allow messages larger than **128 KB** by turning off\
  \ request body inspection, but these messages won't be checked for vulnerabilities. For newer versions (Core Rule Set 3.2\
  \ or newer), the same can be done by disabling the maximum request body limit. When a request exceeds the size limit:\n\n\
  If p**revention mode**: Logs and blocks the request.\\\nIf **detection mode**: Inspects up to the limit, ignores the rest,\
  \ and logs if the `Content-Length` exceeds the limit.\n\n- From [**Akamai**](https://community.akamai.com/customers/s/article/Can-WAF-inspect-all-arguments-and-values-in-request-body?language=en_US)**:**\n\
  \nBy default, the WAF inspects only the first 8KB of a request. It can increase the limit up to 128KB by adding Advanced\
  \ Metadata.\n\n- From [**Cloudflare**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/fields/#http-request-body-fields)**:**\n\
  \nUp to 128KB.\n\n### Static assets inspection gaps (.js GETs)\n\nSome CDN/WAF stacks apply weak or no content inspection\
  \ to GET requests for static assets (for example paths ending with `.js`), while still applying global rules like rate limiting\
  \ and IP reputation. Combined with auto-caching of static extensions, this can be abused to deliver or seed malicious variants\
  \ that affect subsequent HTML responses.\n\nPractical use cases:\n\n- Send payloads in untrusted headers (e.g., `User-Agent`)\
  \ on a GET to a `.js` path to avoid content inspection, then immediately request the main HTML to influence the cached variant.\n\
  - Use a fresh/clean IP; once an IP is flagged, routing changes can make the technique unreliable.\n- In Burp Repeater, use\
  \ \"Send group in parallel\" (single-packet style) to race the two requests (`.js` then HTML) through the same front-end\
  \ path.\n\nThis pairs well with header-reflection cache poisoning. See:\n\n{{#ref}}\ncache-deception/README.md\n{{#endref}}\n\

  \n### Obfuscation <a href=\"#ip-rotation\" id=\"ip-rotation\"></a>\n\n```bash\n# IIS, ASP Clasic\n<%s%cr%u0131pt> == <script>\n\
  \n# Path blacklist bypass - Tomcat\n/path1/path2/ == ;/path1;foo/path2;bar/;\n```\n\n### Unicode Compatability <a href=\"\
  #unicode-compatability\" id=\"unicode-compatability\"></a>\n\nDepending on the implementation of Unicode normalization (more\
  \ info [here](https://jlajara.gitlab.io/Bypass_WAF_Unicode)), characters that share Unicode compatability may be able to\
  \ bypass the WAF and execute as the intended payload. Compatible characters can be found [here](https://www.compart.com/en/unicode).\n\
  \n#### Example <a href=\"#example\" id=\"example\"></a>\n\n```bash\n# under the NFKD normalization algorithm, the characters\
  \ on the left translate\n# to the XSS payload on the right\n＜img src⁼p onerror⁼＇prompt⁽1⁾＇﹥  --> ＜img src=p onerror='prompt(1)'>\n\
  ```\n\n### Bypass Contextual WAFs with encodings <a href=\"#ip-rotation\" id=\"ip-rotation\"></a>\n\nAs mentioned in [**this\
  \ blog post**](https://0x999.net/blog/exploring-javascript-events-bypassing-wafs-via-character-normalization#bypassing-web-application-firewalls-via-character-normalization),\
  \ In order to bypass WAFs able to maintain a context of the user input we could abuse the WAF techniques to actually normalize\
  \ the users input.\n\nFor example, in the post it's mentioned that **Akamai URL decoded a user input 10 times**. Therefore\
  \ something like `<input/%2525252525252525253e/onfocus` will be seen by Akamai as `<input/>/onfocus` which **might think\
  \ that it's ok as the tag is closed**. However, as long as the application doesn't URL decode the input 10 times, the victim\
  \ will see something like `<input/%25252525252525253e/onfocus` which is **still valid for a XSS attack**.\n\nTherefore,\
  \ this allows to **hide payloads in encoded components** that the WAF will decode and interpret while the victim won't.\n\
  \nMoreover, this can be done not only with URL encoded payloads but also with other encodings such as unicode, hex, octal...\n\
  \nIn the post the following final bypasses are suggested:\n\n- Akamai:`akamai.com/?x=<x/%u003e/tabindex=1 autofocus/onfocus=x=self;x['ale'%2b'rt'](999)>`\n\
  - Imperva:`imperva.com/?x=<x/\\x3e/tabindex=1 style=transition:0.1s autofocus/onfocus=\"a=document;b=a.defaultView;b.ontransitionend=b['aler'%2b't'];style.opacity=0;Object.prototype.toString=x=>999\"\
  >`\n- AWS/Cloudfront:`docs.aws.amazon.com/?x=<x/%26%23x3e;/tabindex=1 autofocus/onfocus=alert(999)>`\n- Cloudflare:`cloudflare.com/?x=<x\
  \ tabindex=1 autofocus/onfocus=\"style.transition='0.1s';style.opacity=0;self.ontransitionend=alert;Object.prototype.toString=x=>999\"\
  >`\n\nIt's also mentioned that depending on **how some WAFs understand the context** of the user input, it might be possible\
  \ to abuse it. The proposed example in the blog is that Akamai allow(ed) to put anything between `/*` and `*/` (potentially\
  \ because this is commonly used as comments. Therefore, a SQLinjection such as `/*'or sleep(5)-- -*/` won't be caught and\
  \ will be valid as `/*` is the starting string of the injection and `*/` is commented.\n\nThese kind of context problems\
  \ can also be used to **abuse other vulnerabilities than the one expected** to be exploited by the WAF (e.g. this could\
  \ also be used to exploit a XSS).\n\n### Inline JavaScript first-statement inspection gaps\n\nSome inline-inspection rulesets\
  \ only parse the first JavaScript statement present inside an event handler. By prefixing a harmless-looking expression\
  \ in parentheses followed by a semicolon (for example `onfocus=\"(history.length);payload\"`), the malicious code placed\
  \ after the semicolon bypasses inspection while the browser still executes it. Combining this with fragment-induced focus\
  \ (e.g., appending `#forgot_btn` so the targeted element is focused on load) allows click-less XSS that can immediately\
  \ call `$.getScript` and bootstrap phishing tooling such as keyloggers. See the [attribute-only login XSS case study](xss-cross-site-scripting/README.md#attribute-only-login-xss-behind-wafs)\
  \ derived from [this research](https://blog.hackcommander.com/posts/2025/12/28/turning-a-harmless-xss-behind-a-waf-into-a-realistic-phishing-vector/).\n\

  \n### Regex Bypasses\n\nDifferent techniques can be used to bypass the regex filters on the firewalls. Examples include\
  \ alternating case, adding line breaks, and encoding payloads. Resources for the various bypasses can be found at [PayloadsAllTheThings](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/XSS%20Injection/README.md#filter-bypass-and-exotic-payloads)\
