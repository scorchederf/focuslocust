  \ tools\n\nMore tools in [https://github.com/Claudio-C/awesome-datarecovery](https://github.com/Claudio-C/awesome-datarecovery)\n\
  \n### Autopsy\n\nThe most common tool used in forensics to extract files from images is [**Autopsy**](https://www.autopsy.com/download/).\
  \ Download it, install it and make it ingest the file to find \"hidden\" files. Note that Autopsy is built to support disk\
  \ images and other kinds of images, but not simple files.\n\n> **2024-2025 update** – Version **4.21** (released February\
  \ 2025) added a rebuilt **carving module based on SleuthKit v4.13** that is noticeably quicker when dealing with multi-terabyte\
  \ images and supports parallel extraction on multi-core systems.¹  A small CLI wrapper (`autopsycli ingest <case> <image>`)\
  \ was also introduced, making it possible to script carving inside CI/CD or large-scale lab environments.\n\n```bash\n#\
  \ Create a case and ingest an evidence image from the CLI (Autopsy ≥4.21)\nautopsycli case --create MyCase --base /cases\n\
  # ingest with the default ingest profile (includes data-carve module)\nautopsycli ingest MyCase /evidence/disk01.E01 --threads\
  \ 8\n```\n\n### Binwalk <a href=\"#binwalk\" id=\"binwalk\"></a>\n\n**Binwalk** is a tool for analyzing binary files to\
  \ find embedded content. It's installable via `apt` and its source is on [GitHub](https://github.com/ReFirmLabs/binwalk).\n\
  \n**Useful commands**:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt install binwalk         # Installation\nbinwalk firmware.bin             # Display\
  \ embedded data\nbinwalk -e firmware.bin          # Extract recognised objects (safe-default)\nbinwalk --dd \" .* \" firmware.bin\
  \  # Extract *everything* (use with care)\n```\n\n⚠️  **Security note** – Versions **≤2.3.3** are affected by a **Path Traversal**\
  \ vulnerability (CVE-2022-4510). Upgrade (or isolate with a container/non-privileged UID) before carving untrusted samples.\n\
  \n### Foremost\n\nAnother common tool to find hidden files is **foremost**. You can find the configuration file of foremost\
  \ in `/etc/foremost.conf`. If you just want to search for some specific files uncomment them. If you don't uncomment anything\
  \ foremost will search for its default configured file types.\n\n```bash\nsudo apt-get install foremost\nforemost -v -i\
  \ file.img -o output\n# Discovered files will appear inside the folder \"output\"\n```\n\n### **Scalpel**\n\n**Scalpel**\
  \ is another tool that can be used to find and extract **files embedded in a file**. In this case, you will need to uncomment\
  \ from the configuration file (_/etc/scalpel/scalpel.conf_) the file types you want it to extract.\n\n```bash\nsudo apt-get\
  \ install scalpel\nscalpel file.img -o output\n```\n\n### Bulk Extractor 2.x   \n\nThis tool comes inside kali but you can\
  \ find it here: <https://github.com/simsong/bulk_extractor>\n\nBulk Extractor can scan an evidence image and carve **pcap\
  \ fragments**, **network artefacts (URLs, domains, IPs, MACs, e-mails)** and many other objects **in parallel using multiple\
  \ scanners**.\n\n```bash\n# Build from source – v2.1.1 (April 2024) requires cmake ≥3.16\n git clone https://github.com/simsong/bulk_extractor.git\
  \ && cd bulk_extractor\n mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make -j$(nproc) && sudo make install\n\n# Run every scanner,\
  \ carve JPEGs aggressively and generate a bodyfile\nbulk_extractor -o out_folder -S jpeg_carve_mode=2 -S write_bodyfile=y\
  \ /evidence/disk.img\n```\n\nUseful post-processing scripts (`bulk_diff`, `bulk_extractor_reader.py`) can de-duplicate artefacts\
  \ between two images or convert results to JSON for SIEM ingestion.\n\n### PhotoRec\n\nYou can find it in <https://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk_Download>\n\
  \nIt comes with GUI and CLI versions. You can select the **file-types** you want PhotoRec to search for.\n\n![](<../../../images/image\
  \ (242).png>)\n\n### ddrescue + ddrescueview (imaging failing drives)\n\nWhen a physical drive is unstable, it is best practice\
  \ to **image it first** and only run carving tools against the image.  `ddrescue` (GNU project) focuses on reliably copying\
  \ bad disks while keeping a log of unreadable sectors.\n\n```bash\nsudo apt install gddrescue ddrescueview   # On Debian-based\
  \ systems\n# First pass – try to get as much data as possible without retries\nsudo ddrescue -f -n /dev/sdX suspect.img\
  \ suspect.log\n# Second pass – aggressive, 3 retries on the remaining bad areas\nsudo ddrescue -d -r3 /dev/sdX suspect.img\
  \ suspect.log\n\n# Visualise the status map (green=good, red=bad)\n ddrescueview suspect.log\n```\n\nVersion **1.28** (December\
  \ 2024) introduced **`--cluster-size`** which can speed up imaging of high-capacity SSDs where traditional sector sizes\
  \ no longer align with flash blocks.\n\n### Extundelete / Ext4magic (EXT 3/4 undelete)\n\nIf the source file system is Linux\
  \ EXT-based you may be able to recover recently deleted files **without full carving**. Both tools work directly on a read-only\
  \ image:\n\n```bash\n# Attempt journal-based undelete (metadata must still be present)\nextundelete disk.img --restore-all\n\
  \n# Fallback to full directory scan; supports extents and inline data\next4magic disk.img -M -f '*.jpg' -d ./recovered\n\
  ```\n\n> \U0001F6C8 If the file system was mounted after deletion, the data blocks may have already been reused – in that\
  \ case proper carving (Foremost/Scalpel) is still required.\n\n### binvis\n\nCheck the [code](https://code.google.com/archive/p/binvis/)\
  \ and the [web page tool](https://binvis.io/#/).\n\n#### Features of BinVis\n\n- Visual and active **structure viewer**\n\
  - Multiple plots for different focus points\n- Focusing on portions of a sample\n- **Seeing stings and resources**, in PE\
  \ or ELF executables e. g.\n- Getting **patterns** for cryptanalysis on files\n- **Spotting** packer or encoder algorithms\n\
  - **Identify** Steganography by patterns\n- **Visual** binary-diffing\n\nBinVis is a great **start-point to get familiar\
  \ with an unknown target** in a black-boxing scenario.\n\n## Specific Data Carving Tools\n\n### FindAES\n\nSearches for\
  \ AES keys by searching for their key schedules. Able to find 128. 192, and 256 bit keys, such as those used by TrueCrypt\
  \ and BitLocker.\n\nDownload [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/findaes/).\n\n### YARA-X (triaging carved artefacts)\n\
  \n[YARA-X](https://github.com/VirusTotal/yara-x) is a Rust rewrite of YARA released in 2024.  It is **10-30× faster** than\
  \ classic YARA and can be used to classify thousands of carved objects very quickly:\n\n```bash\n# Scan every carved object\
  \ produced by bulk_extractor\nyarax -r rules/index.yar out_folder/ --threads 8 --print-meta\n```\n\nThe speed‐up makes it\
  \ realistic to **auto-tag** all carved files in large-scale investigations.\n\n## Complementary tools\n\nYou can use [**viu**\
  \ ](https://github.com/atanunq/viu)to see images from the terminal.  \\\nYou can use the linux command line tool **pdftotext**\
  \ to transform a pdf into text and read it.\n\n\n\n## References\n\n1. Autopsy 4.21 release notes – <https://github.com/sleuthkit/autopsy/releases/tag/autopsy-4.21>\n\
