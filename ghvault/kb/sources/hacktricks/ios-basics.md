_body: "# iOS Basics\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n## Filesystem Folders\n\n- `/Applications`: Contains\
  \ all the installed native applications on the device (e.g. `/Applications/Calculator.app`)\n- `/var/containers/Bundle/application/[uuid]`:\
  \ Contains the application bundles for installed apps.\n- `/var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/[uuid]`: Contains the\
  \ data for the installed applications.\n- `/System`: Contains the core system files and libraries.\n- `/Library`: Contains\
  \ system-wide resources and settings.\n- `/User`: Contains user-specific data and settings.\n- `/Development`: Empty unless\
  \ you press the \"Use for development\" button\n- `/dev`: Contains device files.\n- `/Core`: Contains OS core dumps.\n-\
  \ `/private/var/mobile/Library/Logs/CrashReporter/<appname-date>*`: Contains crash logs for the specified application.\n\
  - Many other common unix folders...\n\n### SQLite DBs\n\nSQLite DBs are widely used in iOS and Android applications for\
  \ local data storage. They provide a lightweight, serverless database solution that is easy to integrate and use within\
  \ mobile apps.\n\nA SQLite DB usually generates 3 files:\n- `<name>.db`: The main database file.\n- `<name>.db-shm`: The\
  \ journal file which stores data before a transaction change (for DB restoration if needed).\n- `<name>.db-wal`: The write-ahead\
  \ log file which stores the new data until it's ready to commit to the DB for faster processing.\n\n\n## Privilege Separation\
  \ and Sandbox\n\nIn iOS, a distinction in privilege exists between the user-accessible applications and the system's core\
  \ processes. Applications run under the **`mobile`** user identity, while the crucial system processes operate as **`root`**.\
  \ This separation is enhanced by a sandbox mechanism, which imposes strict limitations on what actions applications can\
  \ undertake. For instance, even if applications share the same user identity, they are prohibited from accessing or modifying\
  \ each other's data.\n\nApplications are installed in a specific directory (`private/var/mobile/Applications/{random ID}`)\
  \ and have restricted read access to certain system areas and functionalities, such as SMS and phone calls. Access to protected\
  \ areas triggers a pop-up request for user permission.\n\n## Data Protection\n\niOS offers developers the **Data Protection\
  \ APIs**, built atop the Secure Enclave Processor (SEP) — a dedicated coprocessor for cryptographic operations and key management.\
  \ The SEP ensures data protection integrity via a unique device-specific key, the device UID, embedded within it.\n\nUpon\
  \ file creation, a unique 256-bit AES encryption key is generated, encrypting the file's content. This encryption key, alongside\
  \ a class ID, is then encrypted using a class key and stored within the file's metadata. Decrypting a file involves using\
  \ the system's key to access the metadata, retrieving the class key with the class ID, and then decrypting the file's unique\
  \ encryption key.\n\niOS defines **four protection classes** for data security, which determine when and how data can be\
  \ accessed:\n\n- **Complete Protection (NSFileProtectionComplete)**: Data is inaccessible until the device is unlocked using\
  \ the user's passcode.\n- **Protected Unless Open (NSFileProtectionCompleteUnlessOpen)**: Allows file access even after\
  \ the device is locked, provided the file was opened when the device was unlocked.\n- **Protected Until First User Authentication\
  \ (NSFileProtectionCompleteUntilFirstUserAuthentication)**: Data is accessible after the first user unlock post-boot, remaining\
  \ accessible even if the device is locked again.\n- **No Protection (NSFileProtectionNone)**: Data is only protected by\
  \ the device UID, facilitating quick remote data wiping.\n\nThe encryption of all classes, except for `NSFileProtectionNone`,\
  \ involves a key derived from both the device UID and the user's passcode, ensuring decryption is only possible on the device\
  \ with the correct passcode. From iOS 7 onwards, the default protection class is \"Protected Until First User Authentication\"\
  .\n\nDevelopers can use [**FileDP**](https://github.com/abjurato/FileDp-Source), a tool for inspecting the data protection\
  \ class of files on an iPhone.\n\n```python\n# Example code to use FileDP for checking file protection class\n# Note: Ensure\
  \ your device is jailbroken and has Python installed to use FileDP.\n# Installation and usage of FileDP:\ngit clone https://github.com/abjurato/FileDp-Source\n\
  cd FileDp-Source\npython filedp.py /path/to/check\n```\n\n### **The Keychain**\n\nIn iOS, a **Keychain** serves as a secure\
  \ **encrypted container** for storing **sensitive information**, accessible only by the application that stored it or those\
  \ explicitly authorized. This encryption is fortified by a unique **password generated by iOS**, which itself is encrypted\
  \ with **AES**. This encryption process leverages a **PBKDF2 function**, combining the user's passcode with a salt derived\
  \ from the device's **UID**, a component only the **secure enclave chipset** can access. Consequently, even if the user's\
  \ passcode is known, the Keychain contents remain inaccessible on any device other than the one where they were originally\
  \ encrypted.\n\n**Management and access** to the Keychain data are handled by the **`securityd` daemon**, based on specific\
  \ app entitlements like `Keychain-access-groups` and `application-identifier`.\n\n#### **Keychain API Operations**\n\nThe\
  \ Keychain API, detailed at [Apple's Keychain Services documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Security/Conceptual/keychainServConcepts/02concepts/concepts.html),\
  \ provides essential functions for secure storage management:\n\n- **`SecItemAdd`**: Adds a new item to the Keychain.\n\
  - **`SecItemUpdate`**: Updates an existing item in the Keychain.\n- **`SecItemCopyMatching`**: Retrieves an item from the\
  \ Keychain.\n- **`SecItemDelete`**: Removes an item from the Keychain.\n\nBrute-forcing the Keychain password involves either\
  \ attacking the encrypted key directly or attempting to guess the passcode on the device itself, hindered significantly\
  \ by secure enclave's enforcement of a delay between failed attempts.\n\n#### **Configuring Keychain Item Data Protection**\n\
  \nData protection levels for Keychain items are set using the `kSecAttrAccessible` attribute during item creation or update.\
  \ These levels, [as specified by Apple](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/keychain_services/keychain_items/item_attribute_keys_and_values#1679100),\
  \ determine when and how Keychain items are accessible:\n\n- **`kSecAttrAccessibleAlways`**: Accessible anytime, regardless\
  \ of device lock status.\n- **`kSecAttrAccessibleAlwaysThisDeviceOnly`**: Always accessible, but not included in backups.\n\
  - **`kSecAttrAccessibleAfterFirstUnlock`**: Accessible after the first unlock post-restart.\n- **`kSecAttrAccessibleAfterFirstUnlockThisDeviceOnly`**:\
  \ Same as above, but not transferable to new devices.\n- **`kSecAttrAccessibleWhenUnlocked`**: Only accessible when the\
  \ device is unlocked.\n- **`kSecAttrAccessibleWhenUnlockedThisDeviceOnly`**: Accessible when unlocked, not included in backups.\n\
  - **`kSecAttrAccessibleWhenPasscodeSetThisDeviceOnly`**: Requires device passcode, not included in backups.\n\n**`AccessControlFlags`**\
  \ further refine access methods, allowing for biometric authentication or passcode use.\n\n#### **Jailbroken Devices Warning**\n\
  \n> [!WARNING]\n> On **jailbroken devices**, the Keychain's protections are compromised, posing a significant security risk.\n\
  \n#### **Persistence of Keychain Data**\n\nUnlike app-specific data deleted upon app uninstallation, **Keychain data persists**\
  \ on the device. This characteristic could enable new owners of a second-hand device to access the previous owner's application\
  \ data simply by reinstalling apps. Developers are advised to proactively clear Keychain data upon app installation or during\
  \ logout to mitigate this risk. Here's a Swift code example demonstrating how to clear Keychain data upon the first app\
  \ launch:\n\n```swift\nlet userDefaults = UserDefaults.standard\n\nif userDefaults.bool(forKey: \"hasRunBefore\") == false\
  \ {\n    // Remove Keychain items here\n\n    // Update the flag indicator\n    userDefaults.set(true, forKey: \"hasRunBefore\"\
  )\n    userDefaults.synchronize() // Forces the app to update UserDefaults\n}\n```\n\n## **App Capabilities**\n\nIn the\
  \ realm of app development, **sandboxing** plays a crucial role in enhancing security. This process ensures that each app\
  \ operates within its own unique home directory, thus preventing it from accessing system files or data belonging to other\
  \ apps. The enforcement of these restrictions is carried out through sandbox policies, which are a part of the **Trusted\
  \ BSD (MAC) Mandatory Access Control Framework**.\n\nDevelopers have the ability to configure certain **capabilities or\
  \ permissions** for their apps, such as **Data Protection** or **Keychain Sharing**. These permissions are applied immediately\
  \ after the app is installed. Nonetheless, for accessing certain protected resources, the app must obtain explicit consent\
  \ from the user at the time of the first attempt. This is achieved through the use of _purpose strings_ or _usage description\
  \ strings_, which are presented to users in a permission request alert.\n\nFor those with access to the source code, verification\
  \ of permissions included in the `Info.plist` file can be done by:\n\n1. Opening the project in Xcode.\n2. Locating and\
  \ opening the `Info.plist` file.\n3. Searching for keys prefixed with `\"Privacy -\"`, with the option to view raw keys/values\
  \ for clarity.\n\nWhen dealing with an IPA file, the following steps can be followed:\n\n1. Unzip the IPA.\n2. Locate the\
  \ `Info.plist` file within `Payload/<appname>.app/`.\n3. Convert the file to XML format if necessary, for easier inspection.\n\
  \nFor example, the purpose strings in the `Info.plist` file might look like this:\n\n```xml\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n\
  \    <key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>\n    <string>Your location is used to provide turn-by-turn directions\
  \ to your destination.</string>\n```\n\n### Device Capabilities\n\nThe `Info.plist` file of an app specifies **device capabilities**\
  \ that help the App Store filter apps for device compatibility. These are defined under the **`UIRequiredDeviceCapabilities`**\
  \ key. For instance:\n\n```xml\n<key>UIRequiredDeviceCapabilities</key>\n<array>\n    <string>armv7</string>\n</array>\n\
  ```\n\nThis example indicates that the app is compatible with the armv7 instruction set. Developers may also specify capabilities\
  \ like nfc to ensure their app is only available to devices supporting NFC.\n\n### Entitlements\n\n**Entitlements** are\
  \ another critical aspect of iOS app development, serving as key-value pairs that grant apps permission to perform certain\
  \ operations beyond runtime checks. For example, enabling **Data Protection** in an app involves adding a specific entitlement\
  \ in the Xcode project, which is then reflected in the app's entitlements file or the embedded mobile provision file for\
  \ IPAs.\n\n## References\n\n- [https://mas.owasp.org/MASTG/iOS/0x06d-Testing-Data-Storage](https://mas.owasp.org/MASTG/iOS/0x06d-Testing-Data-Storage)\n\
