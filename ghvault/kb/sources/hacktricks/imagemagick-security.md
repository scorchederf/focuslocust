_body: "# ImageMagick Security\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\nCheck further details in [**https://blog.doyensec.com/2023/01/10/imagemagick-security-policy-evaluator.html**](https://blog.doyensec.com/2023/01/10/imagemagick-security-policy-evaluator.html)\n\
  \nImageMagick is commonly used behind upload, thumbnailing, document-conversion, and CI/CD pipelines. That makes it a high-value\
  \ target whenever untrusted images, SVGs, EPS, PS, or PDFs reach `magick` / `convert`.\n\nClassic **ImageTragick**-style\
  \ payloads are only part of the story. A modern chain can start from a **single SVG** and end in **arbitrary file write**\
  \ by abusing how ImageMagick generates MVG plus how it delegates EPS/PS parsing to Ghostscript.\n\n## SVG -> MVG injection\
  \ -> `msl:` execution\n\nWhen ImageMagick rasterizes SVG, it first emits an intermediate **MVG** script. If attacker-controlled\
  \ SVG data reaches that generated MVG without normalizing both LF and CR, an XML-encoded carriage return (`&#13;`) can become\
  \ a **new MVG line**.\n\nA practical injection point is the `<polyline points=\"...\">` attribute because the points string\
  \ is copied into MVG almost verbatim. A payload like:\n\n```xml\n<polyline points=\"0,0 50,50&#13;image Over 0,0 1,1 'msl:/tmp/payload.msl'&#13;100,0\"\
  />\n```\n\ncan turn one SVG attribute into attacker-controlled MVG commands.\n\nThe most useful primitive is:\n\n```text\n\
  image Over X,Y W,H 'URL'\n```\n\nThis does **not** only load remote HTTP resources. It can also trigger internal coders\
  \ / protocol handlers such as `data:` and `msl:`.\n\nIf `msl:` is reachable, an attacker can execute **Magick Scripting\
  \ Language** from disk and turn the bug into **arbitrary file write**:\n\n```xml\n<image>\n  <read filename=\"xc:red[10x10]\"\
  />\n  <write filename=\"png:/var/www/html/poc.png\"/>\n</image>\n```\n\nThis is different from older ImageTragick payloads:\
  \ instead of directly trying to get shell metacharacters into a delegate command, the chain abuses **MVG line injection**\
  \ and then pivots into a **second-stage MSL script**.\n\n## Ghostscript delegate as the file dropper\n\nImageMagick usually\
  \ sends **EPS/PS/PDF** work to a **Ghostscript delegate**. That matters even for an SVG upload, because injected MVG can\
  \ load an embedded:\n\n```text\ndata:image/x-eps;base64,...\n```\n\npayload.\n\nIn the published **ImagePanick** repro,\
  \ Ghostscript `10.06.0` running under SAFER can be abused as a file dropper:\n\n- `.tempfile` creates a writable temp file\
  \ and also extends the read/write/control permit lists for that temp path.\n- `writestring` stores attacker-controlled MSL\
  \ bytes.\n- `renamefile` moves the random temp name to a predictable filename such as `/tmp/payload.msl`.\n\nThen a second\
  \ injected MVG line loads:\n\n```text\nmsl:/tmp/payload.msl\n```\n\nand ImageMagick executes the MSL, producing **arbitrary\
  \ file write**. From there, writing into a web root, cron path, shell init file, or `authorized_keys` is usually enough\
  \ for practical RCE or persistence.\n\nFor more Ghostscript-centric notes, see [Ghostscript Injection](../../pentesting-web/formula-csv-doc-latex-ghostscript-injection.md).\n\
  \n## Quick triage\n\nIf a target processes untrusted images, first check which dangerous coders and delegates are still\
  \ available:\n\n```bash\nmagick -list policy\nidentify -list format | grep -E 'SVG|MSL|PS|EPS|PDF'\nconvert -list delegate\
  \ | grep -iE 'gs|ghostscript'\nfind / -iname policy.xml 2>/dev/null\n```\n\nIf the application accepts SVG and the backend\
  \ simply does:\n\n```bash\nmagick input.svg output.png\n```\n\nthat alone may be enough to trigger the chain when weak policies\
  \ and a Ghostscript delegate are present.\n\n## Towards Safer Policies\n\nTo address these challenges, a [tool has been\
  \ developed](https://imagemagick-secevaluator.doyensec.com/) to aid in designing and auditing ImageMagick's security policies.\
  \ This tool is rooted in extensive research and aims to ensure policies are not only robust but also free from loopholes\
  \ that could be exploited.\n\n## Allowlist vs Denylist Approach\n\nHistorically, ImageMagick policies relied on a denylist\
  \ approach, where specific coders were denied access. However, changes in ImageMagick 6.9.7-7 shifted this paradigm, enabling\
  \ an allowlist approach. This approach first denies all coders and then selectively grants access to trusted ones, enhancing\
  \ the security posture.\n\n```xml\n  ...\n  <policy domain=\"coder\" rights=\"none\" pattern=\"*\" />\n  <policy domain=\"\
  coder\" rights=\"read | write\" pattern=\"{GIF,JPEG,PNG,WEBP}\" />\n  ...\n```\n\n## Case Sensitivity in Policies\n\nIt's\
  \ crucial to note that policy patterns in ImageMagick are case sensitive. As such, ensuring that coders and modules are\
  \ correctly upper-cased in policies is vital to prevent unintended permissions.\n\n## Resource Limits\n\nImageMagick is\
  \ prone to denial of service attacks if not properly configured. Setting explicit resource limits in the policy is essential\
  \ to prevent such vulnerabilities.\n\n## Policy Fragmentation\n\nPolicies may be fragmented across different ImageMagick\
  \ installations, leading to potential conflicts or overrides. It's recommended to locate and verify the active policy files\
  \ using commands like:\n\n```shell\n$ find / -iname policy.xml\n```\n\n## A Starter, Restrictive Policy\n\nA restrictive\
  \ policy template has been proposed, focusing on stringent resource limitations and access controls. This template serves\
  \ as a baseline for developing tailored policies that align with specific application requirements.\n\nThe effectiveness\
  \ of a security policy can be confirmed using the `identify -list policy` command in ImageMagick. Additionally, the [evaluator\
  \ tool](https://imagemagick-secevaluator.doyensec.com/) mentioned earlier can be used to refine the policy based on individual\
  \ needs.\n\nFor **untrusted uploads**, prefer an **allowlist**. If SVG / EPS / PS are not required, explicitly block the\
  \ dangerous coders instead of trying to blacklist individual bad payloads:\n\n```xml\n<policy domain=\"coder\" rights=\"\
  none\" pattern=\"{SVG,EPS,PS,MSL}\" />\n```\n\nAdditional hardening:\n\n- Disable the Ghostscript delegate in `delegates.xml`\
  \ if EPS / PS support is not needed.\n- Keep coder names upper-cased because policy patterns are **case sensitive**.\n-\
  \ Prefer a dedicated SVG rasterizer such as `librsvg` for untrusted SVG instead of full ImageMagick + Ghostscript.\n- Run\
  \ conversions in a sandbox (`nsjail`, `firejail`, container, read-only filesystem, restricted tmpdir).\n\n## References\n\
