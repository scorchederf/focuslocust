_body: "# WWW2Exec - .dtors & .fini_array\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n## .dtors\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n\
  > Nowadays is very **weird to find a binary with a .dtors section!**\n\nThe destructors are functions that are **executed\
  \ before program finishes** (after the `main` function returns).\\\nThe addresses to these functions are stored inside the\
  \ **`.dtors`** section of the binary and therefore, if you manage to **write** the **address** to a **shellcode** in **`__DTOR_END__`**\
  \ , that will be **executed** before the programs ends.\n\nGet the address of this section with:\n\n```bash\nobjdump -s\
  \ -j .dtors /exec\nrabin -s /exec | grep “__DTOR”\n```\n\nUsually you will find the **DTOR** markers **between** the values\
  \ `ffffffff` and `00000000`. So if you just see those values, it means that there **isn't any function registered**. So\
  \ **overwrite** the **`00000000`** with the **address** to the **shellcode** to execute it.\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> Ofc, you\
  \ first need to find a **place to store the shellcode** in order to later call it.\n\n## **.fini_array**\n\nEssentially\
  \ this is a structure with **functions that will be called** before the program finishes, like **`.dtors`**. This is interesting\
  \ if you can call your **shellcode just jumping to an address**, or in cases where you need to go **back to `main`** again\
  \ to **exploit the vulnerability a second time**.\n\n```bash\nobjdump -s -j .fini_array ./greeting\n\n./greeting:     file\
  \ format elf32-i386\n\nContents of section .fini_array:\n 8049934 a0850408\n\n#Put your address in 0x8049934\n```\n\nNote\
  \ that when a function from the **`.fini_array`** is executed it moves to the next one, so it won't be executed several\
  \ time (preventing eternal loops), but also it'll only give you 1 **execution of the function** placed here.\n\nNote that\
  \ entries in `.fini_array` are called in **reverse** order, so you probably wants to start writing from the last one.\n\n\
  #### Eternal loop\n\nIn order to abuse **`.fini_array`** to get an eternal loop you can [**check what was done here**](https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/17-stack_pivot/insomnihack18_onewrite/index.html)**:**\
  \ If you have at least 2 entries in **`.fini_array`**, you can:\n\n- Use your first write to **call the vulnerable arbitrary\
  \ write function** again\n- Then, calculate the return address in the stack stored by **`__libc_csu_fini`** (the function\
  \ that is calling all the `.fini_array` functions) and put there the **address of `__libc_csu_fini`**\n  - This will make\
  \ **`__libc_csu_fini`** call himself again executing the **`.fini_array`** functions again which will call the vulnerable\
  \ WWW function 2 times: one for **arbitrary write** and another one to overwrite again the **return address of `__libc_csu_fini`**\
  \ on the stack to call itself again.\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n> Note that with [**Full RELRO**](../common-binary-protections-and-bypasses/relro.md)**,**\
  \ the section **`.fini_array`** is made **read-only**.\n> In newer versions, even with [**Partial RELRO**] the section **`.fini_array`**\
  \ is made **read-only** also.\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}"
