  ### Goal\n\n- Be able to add into the tcache / fast bin an address so later it's possible to allocate it\n\n### Requirements\n\
  \n- This attack requires an attacker to be able to create a couple of fake fast chunks indicating correctly the size value\
  \ of it and then to be able to free the first fake chunk so it gets into the bin.\n- With **tcache (glibc ≥2.26)** the attack\
  \ is even simpler: only one fake chunk is needed (no next-chunk size check is performed on the tcache path) as long as the\
  \ fake chunk is 0x10-aligned and its size field falls in a valid tcache bin (0x20-0x410 on x64).\n\n### Attack\n\n- Create\
  \ fake chunks that bypasses security checks: you will need 2 fake chunks basically indicating in the correct positions the\
  \ correct sizes\n- Somehow manage to free the first fake chunk so it gets into the fast or tcache bin and then it's allocate\
  \ it to overwrite that address\n\n**The code from** [**guyinatuxedo**](https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/39-house_of_spirit/house_spirit_exp/index.html)\
  \ **is great to understand the attack.** Although this schema from the code summarises it pretty good:\n\n<details>\n<summary>Fake\
  \ chunk layout</summary>\n\n```c\n/*\n    this will be the structure of our two fake chunks:\n    assuming that you compiled\
  \ it for x64\n\n    +-------+---------------------+------+\n    | 0x00: | Chunk # 0 prev size | 0x00 |\n    +-------+---------------------+------+\n\
  \    | 0x08: | Chunk # 0 size      | 0x60 |\n    +-------+---------------------+------+\n    | 0x10: | Chunk # 0 content\
  \   | 0x00 |\n    +-------+---------------------+------+\n    | 0x60: | Chunk # 1 prev size | 0x00 |\n    +-------+---------------------+------+\n\
  \    | 0x68: | Chunk # 1 size      | 0x40 |\n    +-------+---------------------+------+\n    | 0x70: | Chunk # 1 content\
  \   | 0x00 |\n    +-------+---------------------+------+\n\n    for what we are doing the prev size values don't matter\
  \ too much\n    the important thing is the size values of the heap headers for our fake chunks\n*/\n```\n\n</details>\n\n\
  > [!TIP]\n> Note that it's necessary to create the second chunk in order to bypass some sanity checks.\n\n### Tcache house\
  \ of spirit (glibc ≥2.26)\n\n- On modern glibc the **tcache fast-path** calls `tcache_put` before validating the next chunk\
  \ size/`prev_inuse`, so only the current fake chunk has to look sane.\n- Requirements:\n  - Fake chunk must be **16-byte\
  \ aligned** and not marked `IS_MMAPPED`/`NON_MAIN_ARENA`.\n  - `size` must belong to a tcache bin and include the **prev_inuse\
  \ bit set** (`size | 1`).\n  - Tcache for that bin must not be full (default max 7 entries).\n- Minimal PoC (stack chunk):\n\
  ```c\nunsigned long long fake[6] __attribute__((aligned(0x10)));\n// chunk header at fake[0]; usable data starts at fake+2\n\
  fake[1] = 0x41;              // fake size (0x40 bin, prev_inuse=1)\nvoid *p = &fake[2];          // points inside fake chunk\n\
  free(p);                     // goes straight into tcache\nvoid *q = malloc(0x30);      // returns stack address fake+2\n\
  ```\n- **Safe-linking** is not a barrier here: the forward pointer stored in tcache is automatically encoded as `fd = ptr\
  \ ^ (heap_base >> 12)` during `free`, so the attacker does not need to know the key when using a single fake chunk.\n- This\
  \ variant is handy when glibc hooks were removed (≥2.34) and you want a fast arbitrary write or to overlap a target buffer\
  \ (e.g., stack/BSS) with a tcache chunk without creating additional corruptions.\n\n## Examples\n\n- **CTF** [**https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/39-house_of_spirit/hacklu14_oreo/index.html**](https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/39-house_of_spirit/hacklu14_oreo/index.html)\n\
  \n  - **Libc infoleak**: Via an overflow it's possible to change a pointer to point to a GOT address in order to leak a\
  \ libc address via the read action of the CTF\n  - **House of Spirit**: Abusing a counter that counts the number of \"rifles\"\
  \ it's possible to generate a fake size of the first fake chunk, then abusing a \"message\" it's possible to fake the second\
  \ size of a chunk and finally abusing an overflow it's possible to change a pointer that is going to be freed so our first\
  \ fake chunk is freed. Then, we can allocate it and inside of it there is going to be the address to where \"message\" is\
  \ stored. Then, it's possible to make this point to the `scanf` entry inside the GOT table, so we can overwrite it with\
  \ the address to system.\\\n    Next time `scanf` is called, we can send the input `\"/bin/sh\"` and get a shell.\n\n- [**Gloater.\
  \ HTB Cyber Apocalypse CTF 2024**](https://7rocky.github.io/en/ctf/other/htb-cyber-apocalypse/gloater/)\n  - **Glibc leak**:\
  \ Uninitialized stack buffer.\n  - **House of Spirit**: We can modify the first index of a global array of heap pointers.\
  \ With a single byte modification, we use `free` on a fake chunk inside a valid chunk, so that we get an overlapping chunks\
  \ situation after allocating again. With that, a simple Tcache poisoning attack works to get an arbitrary write primitive.\n\
