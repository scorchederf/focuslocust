_body: "# macOS Security & Privilege Escalation\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n## Basic MacOS\n\n\
  If you are not familiar with macOS, you should start learning the basics of macOS:\n\n- Special macOS **files & permissions:**\n\
  \n\n{{#ref}}\nmacos-files-folders-and-binaries/\n{{#endref}}\n\n- Common macOS **users**\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nmacos-users.md\n\
  {{#endref}}\n\n- **AppleFS**\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nmacos-applefs.md\n{{#endref}}\n\n- The **architecture** of the k**ernel**\n\n\
  \n{{#ref}}\nmac-os-architecture/\n{{#endref}}\n\n- Common macOS n**etwork services & protocols**\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nmacos-protocols.md\n\
  {{#endref}}\n\n- **Opensource** macOS: [https://opensource.apple.com/](https://opensource.apple.com/)\n  - To download a\
  \ `tar.gz` change a URL such as [https://opensource.apple.com/**source**/dyld/](https://opensource.apple.com/source/dyld/)\
  \ to [https://opensource.apple.com/**tarballs**/dyld/**dyld-852.2.tar.gz**](https://opensource.apple.com/tarballs/dyld/dyld-852.2.tar.gz)\n\
  \n### MacOS MDM\n\nIn companies **macOS** systems are highly probably going to be **managed with a MDM**. Therefore, from\
  \ the perspective of an attacker is interesting to know **how that works**:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\n../macos-red-teaming/macos-mdm/\n\
  {{#endref}}\n\n### MacOS - Inspecting, Debugging and Fuzzing\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nmacos-apps-inspecting-debugging-and-fuzzing/\n\
  {{#endref}}\n\n## MacOS Security Protections\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nmacos-security-protections/\n{{#endref}}\n\n## Attack Surface\n\
  \n### File Permissions\n\nIf a **process running as root writes** a file that can be controlled by a user, the user could\
  \ abuse this to **escalate privileges**.\\\nThis could occur in the following situations:\n\n- File used was already created\
  \ by a user (owned by the user)\n- File used is writable by the user because of a group\n- File used is inside a directory\
  \ owned by the user (the user could create the file)\n- File used is inside a directory owned by root but user has write\
  \ access over it because of a group (the user could create the file)\n\nBeing able to **create a file** that is going to\
  \ be **used by root**, allows a user to **take advantage of its content** or even create **symlinks/hardlinks** to point\
  \ it to another place.\n\nFor this kind of vulnerabilities don't forget to **check vulnerable `.pkg` installers**:\n\n\n\
  {{#ref}}\nmacos-files-folders-and-binaries/macos-installers-abuse.md\n{{#endref}}\n\n### File Extension & URL scheme app\
  \ handlers\n\nWeird apps registered by file extensions could be abused and different applications can be register to open\
  \ specific protocols\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nmacos-file-extension-apps.md\n{{#endref}}\n\n## macOS TCC / SIP Privilege Escalation\n\
  \nIn macOS **applications and binaries can have permissions** to access folders or settings that make them more privileged\
  \ than others.\n\nTherefore, an attacker that wants to successfully compromise a macOS machine will need to **escalate its\
  \ TCC privileges** (or even **bypass SIP**, depending on his needs).\n\nThese privileges are usually given in the form of\
  \ **entitlements** the application is signed with, or the application might requested some accesses and after the **user\
  \ approving them** they can be found in the **TCC databases**. Another way a process can obtain these privileges is by being\
  \ a **child of a process** with those **privileges** as they are usually **inherited**.\n\nFollow these links to find different\
  \ was to [**escalate privileges in TCC**](macos-security-protections/macos-tcc/index.html#tcc-privesc-and-bypasses), to\
  \ [**bypass TCC**](macos-security-protections/macos-tcc/macos-tcc-bypasses/index.html) and how in the past [**SIP has been\
  \ bypassed**](macos-security-protections/macos-sip.md#sip-bypasses).\n\n## macOS Traditional Privilege Escalation\n\nOf\
  \ course from a red teams perspective you should be also interested in escalating to root. Check the following post for\
  \ some hints:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nmacos-privilege-escalation.md\n{{#endref}}\n\n## macOS Compliance\n\n- [https://github.com/usnistgov/macos_security](https://github.com/usnistgov/macos_security)\n\
