_body: "# Model Data Preparation & Evaluation\n\n{{#include ../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\nModel data preparation\
  \ is a crucial step in the machine learning pipeline, as it involves transforming raw data into a format suitable for training\
  \ machine learning models. This process includes several key steps:\n\n1. **Data Collection**: Gathering data from various\
  \ sources, such as databases, APIs, or files. The data can be structured (e.g., tables) or unstructured (e.g., text, images).\n\
  2. **Data Cleaning**: Removing or correcting erroneous, incomplete, or irrelevant data points. This step may involve handling\
  \ missing values, removing duplicates, and filtering outliers.\n3. **Data Transformation**: Converting the data into a suitable\
  \ format for modeling. This may include normalization, scaling, encoding categorical variables, and creating new features\
  \ through techniques like feature engineering.\n4. **Data Splitting**: Dividing the dataset into training, validation, and\
  \ test sets to ensure the model can generalize well to unseen data.\n\n## Data Collection\n\nData collection involves gathering\
  \ data from various sources, which can include:\n- **Databases**: Extracting data from relational databases (e.g., SQL databases)\
  \ or NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB).\n- **APIs**: Fetching data from web APIs, which can provide real-time or historical\
  \ data.\n- **Files**: Reading data from files in formats like CSV, JSON, or XML.\n- **Web Scraping**: Collecting data from\
  \ websites using web scraping techniques.\n\nDepending on the goal of the machine learning project, the data will be extracted\
  \ and collected from relevant sources to ensure it is representative of the problem domain.\n\n## Data Cleaning\n\nData\
  \ cleaning is the process of identifying and correcting errors or inconsistencies in the dataset. This step is essential\
  \ to ensure the quality of the data used for training machine learning models. Key tasks in data cleaning include:\n- **Handling\
  \ Missing Values**: Identifying and addressing missing data points. Common strategies include:\n  - Removing rows or columns\
  \ with missing values.\n  - Imputing missing values using techniques like mean, median, or mode imputation.\n  - Using advanced\
  \ methods like K-nearest neighbors (KNN) imputation or regression imputation.\n- **Removing Duplicates**: Identifying and\
  \ removing duplicate records to ensure each data point is unique.\n- **Filtering Outliers**: Detecting and removing outliers\
  \ that may skew the model's performance. Techniques like Z-score, IQR (Interquartile Range), or visualizations (e.g., box\
  \ plots) can be used to identify outliers.\n\n### Example of data cleaning\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n# Load the\
  \ dataset\ndata = pd.read_csv('data.csv')\n\n# Finding invalid values based on a specific function\ndef is_valid_possitive_int(num):\n\
  \    try:\n        num = int(num)\n        return 1 <= num <= 31\n    except ValueError:\n        return False\n\ninvalid_days\
  \ = data[~data['days'].astype(str).apply(is_valid_positive_int)]\n\n## Dropping rows with invalid days\ndata = data.drop(invalid_days.index,\
  \ errors='ignore')\n\n\n\n# Set \"NaN\" values to a specific value\n## For example, setting NaN values in the 'days' column\
  \ to 0\ndata['days'] = pd.to_numeric(data['days'], errors='coerce')\n\n## For example, set \"NaN\" to not ips\ndef is_valid_ip(ip):\n\
  \    pattern = re.compile(r'^((25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?\\d?\\d)\\.){3}(25[0-5]|2[0-4]\\d|[01]?\\d?\\d)$')\n    if pd.isna(ip)\
  \ or not pattern.match(str(ip)):\n        return np.nan\n    return ip\ndf['ip'] = df['ip'].apply(is_valid_ip)\n\n# Filling\
  \ missing values based on different strategies\nnumeric_cols = [\"days\", \"hours\", \"minutes\"]\ncategorical_cols = [\"\
  ip\", \"status\"]\n\n## Filling missing values in numeric columns with the median\nnum_imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='median')\n\
  df[numeric_cols] = num_imputer.fit_transform(df[numeric_cols])\n\n## Filling missing values in categorical columns with\
  \ the most frequent value\ncat_imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='most_frequent')\ndf[categorical_cols] = cat_imputer.fit_transform(df[categorical_cols])\n\
  \n## Filling missing values in numeric columns using KNN imputation\nknn_imputer = KNNImputer(n_neighbors=5)\ndf[numeric_cols]\
  \ = knn_imputer.fit_transform(df[numeric_cols])\n\n\n\n# Filling missing values\ndata.fillna(data.mean(), inplace=True)\n\
  \n# Removing duplicates\ndata.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)\n# Filtering outliers using Z-score\nfrom scipy import stats\n\
  z_scores = stats.zscore(data.select_dtypes(include=['float64', 'int64']))\ndata = data[(z_scores < 3).all(axis=1)]\n```\n\
  \n## Data Transformation\n\nData transformation involves converting the data into a format suitable for modeling. This step\
  \ may include:\n- **Normalization & Standarization**: Scaling numerical features to a common range, typically [0, 1] or\
  \ [-1, 1]. This helps improve the convergence of optimization algorithms.\n    - **Min-Max Scaling**: Rescaling features\
  \ to a fixed range, usually [0, 1]. This is done using the formula: `X' = (X - X_{min}) / (X_{max} - X_{min})`\n    - **Z-Score\
  \ Normalization**: Standardizing features by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation, resulting in a\
  \ distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This is done using the formula: `X' = (X - μ) / σ`, where\
  \ μ is the mean and σ is the standard deviation.\n    - **Skeyewness and Kurtosis**: Adjusting the distribution of features\
  \ to reduce skewness (asymmetry) and kurtosis (peakedness). This can be done using transformations like logarithmic, square\
  \ root, or Box-Cox transformations. For example, if a feature has a skewed distribution, applying a logarithmic transformation\
  \ can help normalize it.\n    - **String Normalization**: Converting strings to a consistent format, such as:\n      - Lowercasing\n\
  \      - Removing special characters (keeping the relevant ones)\n      - Removing stop words (common words that do not\
  \ contribute to the meaning, such as \"the\", \"is\", \"and\")\n      - Removing too frequent words and too rare words (e.g.,\
  \ words that appear in more than 90% of the documents or less than 5 times in the corpus)\n      - Trimming whitespace\n\
  \      - Stemming/Lemmatization: Reducing words to their base or root form (e.g., \"running\" to \"run\").\n\n- **Encoding\
  \ Categorical Variables**: Converting categorical variables into numerical representations. Common techniques include:\n\
  \  - **One-Hot Encoding**: Creating binary columns for each category.\n    - For example, if a feature has categories \"\
  red\", \"green\", and \"blue\", it will be transformed into three binary columns: `is_red`(100), `is_green`(010), and `is_blue`(001).\n\
  \  - **Label Encoding**: Assigning a unique integer to each category.\n    - For example, \"red\" = 0, \"green\" = 1, \"\
  blue\" = 2.\n  - **Ordinal Encoding**: Assigning integers based on the order of categories.\n    - For example, if the categories\
  \ are \"low\", \"medium\", and \"high\", they can be encoded as 0, 1, and 2, respectively.\n  - **Hashing Encoding**: Using\
  \ a hash function to convert categories into fixed-size vectors, which can be useful for high-cardinality categorical variables.\n\
  \    - For example, if a feature has many unique categories, hashing can reduce the dimensionality while preserving some\
  \ information about the categories.\n  - **Bag of Words (BoW)**: Representing text data as a matrix of word counts or frequencies,\
  \ where each row corresponds to a document and each column corresponds to a unique word in the corpus.\n    - For example,\
  \ if the corpus contains the words \"cat\", \"dog\", and \"fish\", a document containing \"cat\" and \"dog\" would be represented\
  \ as [1, 1, 0]. This specific representation is called \"unigram\" and does not capture the order of words, so it loses\
  \ semantic information.\n    - **Bigram/Trigram**: Extending BoW to capture sequences of words (bigrams or trigrams) to\
  \ retain some context. For example, \"cat and dog\" would be represented as a bigram [1, 1] for \"cat and\" and [1, 1] for\
  \ \"and dog\". In these case more semantic information is gathered (increasing the dimensionality of the representation)\
  \ but only for 2 or 3 words at a time.\n  - **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**: A statistical measure\
  \ that evaluates the importance of a word in a document relative to a collection of documents (corpus). It combines term\
  \ frequency (how often a word appears in a document) and inverse document frequency (how rare a word is across all documents).\n\
  \    - For example, if the word \"cat\" appears frequently in a document but is rare in the entire corpus, it will have\
  \ a high TF-IDF score, indicating its importance in that document.\n\n\n- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features\
  \ from existing ones to enhance the model's predictive power. This can involve combining features, extracting date/time\
  \ components, or applying domain-specific transformations.\n\n## Data Splitting\n\nData splitting involves dividing the\
  \ dataset into separate subsets for training, validation, and testing. This is essential to evaluate the model's performance\
  \ on unseen data and prevent overfitting. Common strategies include:\n- **Train-Test Split**: Dividing the dataset into\
  \ a training set (typically 60-80% of the data), a validation set (10-15% of the data) to tune hyperparameters, and a test\
  \ set (10-15% of the data). The model is trained on the training set and evaluated on the test set.\n  - For example, if\
  \ you have a dataset of 1000 samples, you might use 700 samples for training, 150 for validation, and 150 for testing.\n\
  - **Stratified Sampling**: Ensuring that the distribution of classes in the training and test sets is similar to the overall\
  \ dataset. This is particularly important for imbalanced datasets, where some classes may have significantly fewer samples\
  \ than others.\n- **Time Series Split**: For time series data, the dataset is split based on time, ensuring that the training\
  \ set contains data from earlier time periods and the test set contains data from later periods. This helps evaluate the\
  \ model's performance on future data.\n- **K-Fold Cross-Validation**: Splitting the dataset into K subsets (folds) and training\
  \ the model K times, each time using a different fold as the test set and the remaining folds as the training set. This\
  \ helps ensure that the model is evaluated on different subsets of data, providing a more robust estimate of its performance.\n\
  \n## Model Evaluation\n\nModel evaluation is the process of assessing the performance of a machine learning model on unseen\
  \ data. It involves using various metrics to quantify how well the model generalizes to new data. Common evaluation metrics\
  \ include:\n\n### Accuracy\n\nAccuracy is the proportion of correctly predicted instances out of the total instances. It\
  \ is calculated as:\n```plaintext\nAccuracy = (Number of Correct Predictions) / (Total Number of Predictions)\n```\n\n>\
  \ [!TIP]\n> Accuracy is a simple and intuitive metric, but it may not be suitable for imbalanced datasets where one class\
  \ dominates the others as it can give a misleading impression of model performance. For example, if 90% of the data belongs\
  \ to class A and the model predicts all instances as class A, it will achieve 90% accuracy, but it won't be useful for predicting\
  \ class B.\n\n### Precision\n\nPrecision is the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions\
  \ made by the model. It is calculated as:\n```plaintext\nPrecision = (True Positives) / (True Positives + False Positives)\n\
  ```\n\n> [!TIP]\n> Precision is particularly important in scenarios where false positives are costly or undesirable, such\
  \ as in medical diagnoses or fraud detection. For example, if a model predicts 100 instances as positive, but only 80 of\
  \ them are actually positive, the precision would be 0.8 (80%).\n\n### Recall (Sensitivity)\n\nRecall, also known as sensitivity\
  \ or true positive rate, is the proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positive instances. It is calculated\
  \ as:\n```plaintext\nRecall = (True Positives) / (True Positives + False Negatives)\n```\n\n> [!TIP]\n> Recall is crucial\
  \ in scenarios where false negatives are costly or undesirable, such as in disease detection or spam filtering. For example,\
  \ if a model identifies 80 out of 100 actual positive instances, the recall would be 0.8 (80%).\n\n### F1 Score\n\nThe F1\
  \ score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two metrics. It is calculated as:\n\
  ```plaintext\nF1 Score = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)\n```\n\n> [!TIP]\n> The F1 score is particularly\
  \ useful when dealing with imbalanced datasets, as it considers both false positives and false negatives. It provides a\
  \ single metric that captures the trade-off between precision and recall. For example, if a model has a precision of 0.8\
  \ and a recall of 0.6, the F1 score would be approximately 0.69.\n\n### ROC-AUC (Receiver Operating Characteristic - Area\
  \ Under the Curve)\n\nThe ROC-AUC metric evaluates the model's ability to distinguish between classes by plotting the true\
  \ positive rate (sensitivity) against the false positive rate at various threshold settings. The area under the ROC curve\
  \ (AUC) quantifies the model's performance, with a value of 1 indicating perfect classification and a value of 0.5 indicating\
  \ random guessing.\n\n> [!TIP]\n> ROC-AUC is particularly useful for binary classification problems and provides a comprehensive\
  \ view of the model's performance across different thresholds. It is less sensitive to class imbalance compared to accuracy.\
  \ For example, a model with an AUC of 0.9 indicates that it has a high ability to distinguish between positive and negative\
  \ instances.\n\n### Specificity\n\nSpecificity, also known as true negative rate, is the proportion of true negative predictions\
  \ out of all actual negative instances. It is calculated as:\n```plaintext\nSpecificity = (True Negatives) / (True Negatives\
  \ + False Positives)\n```\n\n> [!TIP]\n> Specificity is important in scenarios where false positives are costly or undesirable,\
  \ such as in medical testing or fraud detection. It helps assess how well the model identifies negative instances. For example,\
  \ if a model correctly identifies 90 out of 100 actual negative instances, the specificity would be 0.9 (90%).\n\n### Matthews\
  \ Correlation Coefficient (MCC)\nThe Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) is a measure of the quality of binary classifications.\
  \ It takes into account true and false positives and negatives, providing a balanced view of the model's performance. The\
  \ MCC is calculated as:\n```plaintext\nMCC = (TP * TN - FP * FN) / sqrt((TP + FP) * (TP + FN) * (TN + FP) * (TN + FN))\n\
  ```\nwhere:\n- **TP**: True Positives\n- **TN**: True Negatives\n- **FP**: False Positives\n- **FN**: False Negatives\n\n\
  > [!TIP]\n> The MCC ranges from -1 to 1, where 1 indicates perfect classification, 0 indicates random guessing, and -1 indicates\
  \ total disagreement between prediction and observation. It is particularly useful for imbalanced datasets, as it considers\
  \ all four confusion matrix components.\n\n### Mean Absolute Error (MAE)\nMean Absolute Error (MAE) is a regression metric\
  \ that measures the average absolute difference between predicted and actual values. It is calculated as:\n```plaintext\n\
  MAE = (1/n) * Σ|y_i - ŷ_i|\n```\nwhere:\n- **n**: Number of instances\n- **y_i**: Actual value for instance i\n- **ŷ_i**:\
  \ Predicted value for instance i\n\n> [!TIP]\n> MAE provides a straightforward interpretation of the average error in predictions,\
  \ making it easy to understand. It is less sensitive to outliers compared to other metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE).\
  \ For example, if a model has an MAE of 5, it means that, on average, the model's predictions deviate from the actual values\
  \ by 5 units.\n\n### Confusion Matrix\n\nThe confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the performance of a classification\
  \ model by showing the counts of true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions. It provides\
  \ a detailed view of how well the model performs on each class.\n\n|               | Predicted Positive | Predicted Negative\
  \ |\n|---------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Actual Positive| True Positive (TP)  | False Negative\
  \ (FN)  |\n| Actual Negative| False Positive (FP) | True Negative (TN)   |\n\n- **True Positive (TP)**: The model correctly\
  \ predicted the positive class.\n- **True Negative (TN)**: The model correctly predicted the negative class.\n- **False\
  \ Positive (FP)**: The model incorrectly predicted the positive class (Type I error).\n- **False Negative (FN)**: The model\
  \ incorrectly predicted the negative class (Type II error).\n\nThe confusion matrix can be used to calculate various evaluation\
  \ metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.\n\n\n{{#include ../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}"
