_body: "# Information in Printers\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\nThere are several blogs in the Internet\
  \ which **highlight the dangers of leaving printers configured with LDAP with default/weak** logon credentials.  \\\nThis\
  \ is because an attacker could **trick the printer to authenticate against a rogue LDAP server** (typically a `nc -vv -l\
  \ -p 389` or `slapd -d 2` is enough) and capture the printer **credentials in clear-text**.\n\nAlso, several printers will\
  \ contain **logs with usernames** or could even be able to **download all usernames** from the Domain Controller.\n\nAll\
  \ this **sensitive information** and the common **lack of security** makes printers very interesting for attackers.\n\n\
  Some introductory blogs about the topic:\n\n- [https://www.ceos3c.com/hacking/obtaining-domain-credentials-printer-netcat/](https://www.ceos3c.com/hacking/obtaining-domain-credentials-printer-netcat/)\n\
  - [https://medium.com/@nickvangilder/exploiting-multifunction-printers-during-a-penetration-test-engagement-28d3840d8856](https://medium.com/@nickvangilder/exploiting-multifunction-printers-during-a-penetration-test-engagement-28d3840d8856)\n\
  \n---\n## Printer Configuration\n\n- **Location**: The LDAP server list is usually found in the web interface (e.g. *Network\
  \ ➜ LDAP Setting ➜ Setting Up LDAP*).\n- **Behavior**: Many embedded web servers allow LDAP server modifications **without\
  \ re-entering credentials** (usability feature → security risk).\n- **Exploit**: Redirect the LDAP server address to an\
  \ attacker-controlled host and use the *Test Connection* / *Address Book Sync* button to force the printer to bind to you.\n\
  \n---\n## Capturing Credentials\n\n### Method 1 – Netcat Listener\n\n```bash\nsudo nc -k -v -l -p 389     # LDAPS → 636\
  \ (or 3269)\n```\n\nSmall/old MFPs may send a simple *simple-bind* in clear-text that netcat can capture. Modern devices\
  \ usually perform an anonymous query first and then attempt the bind, so results vary.\n\n### Method 2 – Full Rogue LDAP\
  \ server (recommended)\n\nBecause many devices will issue an anonymous search *before* authenticating, standing up a real\
  \ LDAP daemon yields much more reliable results:\n\n```bash\n# Debian/Ubuntu example\nsudo apt install slapd ldap-utils\n\
  sudo dpkg-reconfigure slapd   # set any base-DN – it will not be validated\n\n# run slapd in foreground / debug 2\nslapd\
  \ -d 2 -h \"ldap:///\"      # only LDAP, no LDAPS\n```\n\nWhen the printer performs its lookup you will see the clear-text\
  \ credentials in the debug output.\n\n> \U0001F4A1  You can also use `impacket/examples/ldapd.py` (Python rogue LDAP) or\
  \ `Responder -w -r -f` to harvest NTLMv2 hashes over LDAP/SMB.\n\n---\n## Recent Pass-Back Vulnerabilities (2024-2025)\n\
  \nPass-back is *not* a theoretical issue – vendors keep publishing advisories in 2024/2025 that exactly describe this attack\
  \ class.\n\n### Xerox VersaLink – CVE-2024-12510 & CVE-2024-12511\n\nFirmware ≤ 57.69.91 of Xerox VersaLink C70xx MFPs allowed\
  \ an authenticated admin (or anyone when default creds remain) to:\n\n* **CVE-2024-12510 – LDAP pass-back**: change the\
  \ LDAP server address and trigger a lookup, causing the device to leak the configured Windows credentials to the attacker-controlled\
  \ host.\n* **CVE-2024-12511 – SMB/FTP pass-back**: identical issue via *scan-to-folder* destinations, leaking NetNTLMv2\
  \ or FTP clear-text creds.\n\nA simple listener such as:\n\n```bash\nsudo nc -k -v -l -p 389     # capture LDAP bind\n```\n\
  \nor a rogue SMB server (`impacket-smbserver`) is enough to harvest the credentials.  \n\n### Canon imageRUNNER / imageCLASS\
  \ – Advisory 20 May 2025\n\nCanon confirmed a **SMTP/LDAP pass-back** weakness in dozens of Laser & MFP product lines. An\
  \ attacker with admin access can modify the server configuration and retrieve the stored credentials for LDAP **or** SMTP\
  \ (many orgs use a privileged account to allow scan-to-mail).  \n\nThe vendor guidance explicitly recommends:\n\n1. Updating\
  \ to patched firmware as soon as available.\n2. Using strong, unique admin passwords.\n3. Avoiding privileged AD accounts\
  \ for printer integration.\n\n---\n## Automated Enumeration / Exploitation Tools\n\n| Tool | Purpose | Example |\n|------|---------|---------|\n\
  | **PRET** (Printer Exploitation Toolkit) | PostScript/PJL/PCL abuse, file-system access, default-creds check, *SNMP discovery*\
  \ | `python pret.py 192.168.1.50 pjl` |\n| **Praeda** | Harvest configuration (including address books & LDAP creds) via\
  \ HTTP/HTTPS | `perl praeda.pl -t 192.168.1.50` |\n| **Responder / ntlmrelayx** | Capture & relay NetNTLM hashes from SMB/FTP\
  \ pass-back | `responder -I eth0 -wrf` |\n| **impacket-ldapd.py** | Lightweight rogue LDAP service to receive clear-text\
  \ binds | `python ldapd.py -debug` |\n\n---\n## Hardening & Detection\n\n1. **Patch / firmware-update** MFPs promptly (check\
  \ vendor PSIRT bulletins).\n2. **Least-Privilege Service Accounts** – never use Domain Admin for LDAP/SMB/SMTP; restrict\
  \ to *read-only* OU scopes.\n3. **Restrict Management Access** – place printer web/IPP/SNMP interfaces in a management VLAN\
  \ or behind an ACL/VPN.\n4. **Disable Unused Protocols** – FTP, Telnet, raw-9100, older SSL ciphers.\n5. **Enable Audit\
  \ Logging** – some devices can syslog LDAP/SMTP failures; correlate unexpected binds.\n6. **Monitor for Clear-Text LDAP\
  \ binds** on unusual sources (printers should normally talk only to DCs).\n7. **SNMPv3 or disable SNMP** – community `public`\
  \ often leaks device & LDAP config.\n\n---\n## References\n\n- [https://grimhacker.com/2018/03/09/just-a-printer/](https://grimhacker.com/2018/03/09/just-a-printer/)\n\
