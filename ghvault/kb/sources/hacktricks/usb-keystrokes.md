_body: "# USB Keystrokes\n\n{{#include ../../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\nIf you have a pcap containing the communication\
  \ via USB of a keyboard like the following one:\n\n![](<../../../images/image (962).png>)\n\nUSB keyboards usually speak\
  \ the HID **boot protocol**, so every interrupt transfer towards the host is only 8 bytes long: one byte of modifier bits\
  \ (Ctrl/Shift/Alt/Super), one reserved byte, and up to six keycodes per report. Decoding those bytes is enough to rebuild\
  \ everything that was typed.\n\n## USB HID report basics\n\nThe typical IN report looks like:\n\n| Byte | Meaning |\n| ---\
  \ | --- |\n| 0 | Modifier bitmap (`0x02` = Left Shift, `0x20` = Right Alt, etc.). Multiple bits can be set simultaneously.\
  \ |\n| 1 | Reserved/padding but often reused by gaming keyboards for vendor data. |\n| 2-7 | Up to six concurrent keycodes\
  \ in USB usage ID format (`0x04 = a`, `0x1E = 1`). `0x00` means \"no key\". | \n\nKeyboards without NKRO usually send `0x01`\
  \ in byte 2 when more than six keys are pressed to signal \"rollover\". Understanding this layout helps when you only have\
  \ the raw `usb.capdata` bytes.\n\n## Extracting HID data from a PCAP\n\n### Identify the keyboard interface first\n\nOn\
  \ busy captures, identify the HID keyboard before dumping any reports. A reliable starting point is the interface descriptor\
  \ response:\n\n```text\nusb.transfer_type == 0x02 && usb.endpoint_address.direction == 1 && usb.bDescriptorType == 4 &&\
  \ usb.bInterfaceClass == 3\n```\n\nLook at `usb.bInterfaceSubClass` and `usb.bInterfaceProtocol`:\n\n- `subclass == 1` and\
  \ `protocol == 1` usually means a boot keyboard\n- `protocol == 2` is typically a mouse\n- `protocol == 0` often means a\
  \ vendor-defined or NKRO-style HID interface that still carries keyboard data, but not in the simple 8-byte boot layout\n\
  \nOnce the interface is known, pin your filters to `usb.bus_id`, `usb.device_address`, and if possible `usb.interface_number`\
  \ before exporting anything.\n\n### Wireshark workflow\n\n1. **Isolate the device**: filter on interrupt IN traffic from\
  \ the keyboard, e.g. `usb.transfer_type == 0x01 && usb.endpoint_address.direction == \"IN\" && usb.device_address == 3`.\n\
  2. **Add useful columns**: right-click the `Leftover Capture Data` field (`usb.capdata`) and your preferred `usbhid.*` fields\
  \ (e.g. `usbhid.boot_report.keyboard.keycode_1`) to follow keystrokes without opening every frame.\n3. **Hide empty reports**:\
  \ apply `!(usb.capdata == 00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00)` to drop idle frames.\n4. **Export for post-processing**: `File -> Export\
  \ Packet Dissections -> As CSV`, include `frame.number`, `usb.src`, `usb.capdata`, and `usbhid.modifiers` to script the\
  \ reconstruction later.\n\n### Command-line workflow\n\n`ctf-usb-keyboard-parser` already automates the classic tshark +\
  \ sed pipeline:\n\n```bash\ntshark -r ./usb.pcap -Y 'usb.capdata && usb.data_len == 8' -T fields -e usb.capdata | sed 's/../:&/g2'\
  \ > keystrokes.txt\npython3 usbkeyboard.py ./keystrokes.txt\n```\n\nOn newer captures you can keep both `usb.capdata` and\
  \ the richer `usbhid.data` field by batching per device:\n\n```bash\ntshark -r usb.pcapng -Y \"usb.capdata || usbhid.data\"\
  \ -T fields -e usb.src -e usb.capdata -e usbhid.data | \\\n  sort -s -k1,1 | \\\n  awk '{ printf \"%s\", (NR==1 ? $1 : pre!=$1\
  \ ? \"\\n\" $1 : \"\") \" \" $2; pre=$1 }' | \\\n  awk '{ for (i=2; i<=NF; i++) print $i > \"usbdata-\" $1 \".txt\" }'\n\
  ```\n\nThose per-device files drop straight into any decoder. If the capture came from BLE keyboards tunneled over GATT,\
  \ filter on `btatt.value && frame.len == 20` and dump the hex payloads before decoding.\n\n### When the report is not the\
  \ classic 8-byte boot report\n\nRecent gaming keyboards, split keyboards, and composite HID devices often expose a non-boot\
  \ keyboard interface where the payload no longer matches `modifier,reserved,key1..key6`.\n\n- Prefer `usbhid.data` over\
  \ `usb.capdata` when Wireshark has already parsed the HID layer.\n- If every line starts with a constant prefix or report\
  \ ID, strip it with an offset-aware decoder rather than assuming byte 0 is always the modifier.\n- Some USBPcap exports\
  \ omit the reserved byte, so decoders that support `--no-reserved` or a custom offset save time.\n- If the HID report descriptor\
  \ or BLE HOGP report map is present in the capture, use it to recover the actual field layout before writing a parser.\n\
  \n## Automating the decoding\n\n- **ctf-usb-keyboard-parser** remains handy for quick CTF challenges and already ships in\
  \ the repository.\n- **CTF-Usb_Keyboard_Parser** (`main.py`) parses both `pcap` and `pcapng` files natively, understands\
  \ `LinkTypeUsbLinuxMmapped`/`LinkTypeUsbPcap`, and does not require tshark, so it works nicely inside isolated sandboxes.\n\
  - **USB-HID-decoders** adds keyboard, mouse, and tablet visualizers. You can either run the `extract_hid_data.sh` helper\
  \ (tshark backend) or `extract_hid_data.py` (scapy backend) and then feed the resulting text file to the decoder or replay\
  \ modules to watch the keystrokes unfold.\n\n### Stateful decoding matters\n\nUSB interrupt captures usually contain both\
  \ the key press and one or more repeated copies of the same report before the release event arrives. A practical decoder\
  \ should:\n\n- emit only newly pressed keycodes compared to the previous report\n- keep modifier state (`Shift`, `Ctrl`,\
  \ `AltGr`) from byte 0 or the parsed `usbhid.boot_report.keyboard.modifier` field\n- track toggle keys such as `Caps Lock`,\
  \ because uppercase output is not controlled by Shift alone\n- remember that HID usage IDs are layout-agnostic: `0x1d` is\
  \ the physical `z`/`y` key position depending on the host keyboard layout\n\n## Quick Python decoder\n\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/env\
  \ python3\nimport sys\nNORMAL = {0x04:'a',0x05:'b',0x06:'c',0x07:'d',0x08:'e',0x09:'f',0x0a:'g',0x1c:'y',0x1d:'z',0x28:'\\\
  n',0x2d:'-',0x2e:'=',0x2f:'[',0x30:']',0x33:';',0x34:\"'\",0x36:',',0x37:'.'}\nSHIFTED = {0x2d:'_',0x2e:'+',0x2f:'{',0x30:'}',0x33:':',0x34:'\"\
  ',0x36:'<',0x37:'>'}\nprev = set()\ncaps = False\nfor raw in sys.stdin:\n    raw = raw.strip().replace(':', '')\n    if\
  \ len(raw) != 16:\n        continue\n    modifier = int(raw[0:2], 16)\n    keycodes = [int(raw[i:i+2], 16) for i in range(4,\
  \ 16, 2)]\n    current = {k for k in keycodes if k}\n    newly_pressed = [k for k in keycodes if k and k not in prev]\n\
  \    shift = bool(modifier & 0x22)\n    for keycode in newly_pressed:\n        if keycode == 0x39:\n            caps = not\
  \ caps\n            continue\n        char = SHIFTED.get(keycode) if shift else None\n        if char is None:\n       \
  \     char = NORMAL.get(keycode, '?')\n            if char.isalpha() and (shift ^ caps):\n                char = char.upper()\n\
  \        sys.stdout.write(char)\n    prev = current\n```\n\nFeed it with the plain hex lines dumped earlier to get an instant\
  \ rough reconstruction without pulling a full parser into the environment. For non-US layouts this still reconstructs the\
  \ physical key position, not necessarily the final glyph shown on the victim host.\n\n## Troubleshooting tips\n\n- If Wireshark\
  \ does not populate `usbhid.*` fields, the HID report descriptor was probably not captured. Replug the keyboard while capturing\
  \ or fall back to raw `usb.capdata`.\n- On Linux software captures, `usbmon` is the normal source; on Windows, Wireshark\
  \ depends on the **USBPcap** extcap to see raw USB URBs at all.\n- If the keyboard was attached through a hub or dock, confirm\
  \ the interface descriptor first and then decode only that device/interface pair. Composite HID captures frequently mix\
  \ keyboard and mouse reports.\n- Windows captures require the **USBPcap** extcap interface; make sure it survived Wireshark\
  \ upgrades, as missing extcaps leave you with empty device lists.\n- Always correlate `usb.bus_id:device:interface` (e.g.\
  \ `1.9.1`) before decoding anything — mixing multiple keyboards or storage devices leads to nonsense keystrokes.\n\n## References\n\
