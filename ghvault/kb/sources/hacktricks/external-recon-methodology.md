  \ you were said that everything belonging to some company is inside the scope, and you want to figure out what this company\
  \ actually owns.\n\nThe goal of this phase is to obtain all the **companies owned by the main company** and then all the\
  \ **assets** of these companies. To do so, we are going to:\n\n1. Find the acquisitions of the main company, this will give\
  \ us the companies inside the scope.\n2. Find the ASN (if any) of each company, this will give us the IP ranges owned by\
  \ each company\n3. Use reverse whois lookups to search for other entries (organisation names, domains...) related to the\
  \ first one (this can be done recursively)\n4. Use other techniques like shodan `org`and `ssl`filters to search for other\
  \ assets (the `ssl` trick can be done recursively).\n\n### **Acquisitions**\n\nFirst of all, we need to know which **other\
  \ companies are owned by the main company**.\\\nOne option is to visit [https://www.crunchbase.com/](https://www.crunchbase.com),\
  \ **search** for the **main company**, and **click** on \"**acquisitions**\". There you will see other companies acquired\
  \ by the main one.\\\nOther option is to visit the **Wikipedia** page of the main company and search for **acquisitions**.\\\
  \nFor public companies, check **SEC/EDGAR filings**, **investor relations** pages, or local corporate registries (e.g.,\
  \ **Companies House** in the UK).\\\nFor global corporate trees and subsidiaries, try **OpenCorporates** ([https://opencorporates.com/](https://opencorporates.com/))\
  \ and the **GLEIF LEI** database ([https://www.gleif.org/](https://www.gleif.org/)).\n\n> Ok, at this point you should know\
  \ all the companies inside the scope. Lets figure out how to find their assets.\n\n### **ASNs**\n\nAn autonomous system\
  \ number (**ASN**) is a **unique number** assigned to an **autonomous system** (AS) by the **Internet Assigned Numbers Authority\
  \ (IANA)**.\\\nAn **AS** consists of **blocks** of **IP addresses** which have a distinctly defined policy for accessing\
  \ external networks and are administered by a single organisation but may be made up of several operators.\n\nIt's interesting\
  \ to find if the **company have assigned any ASN** to find its **IP ranges.** It will be interested to perform a **vulnerability\
  \ test** against all the **hosts** inside the **scope** and **look for domains** inside these IPs.\\\nYou can **search**\
  \ by company **name**, by **IP** or by **domain** in [**https://bgp.he.net/**](https://bgp.he.net)**,** [**https://bgpview.io/**](https://bgpview.io/)\
  \ **or** [**https://ipinfo.io/**](https://ipinfo.io/).\\\n**Depending on the region of the company this links could be useful\
  \ to gather more data:** [**AFRINIC**](https://www.afrinic.net) **(Africa),** [**Arin**](https://www.arin.net/about/welcome/region/)**(North\
  \ America),** [**APNIC**](https://www.apnic.net) **(Asia),** [**LACNIC**](https://www.lacnic.net) **(Latin America),** [**RIPE\
  \ NCC**](https://www.ripe.net) **(Europe). Anyway, probably all the** useful information **(IP ranges and Whois)** appears\
  \ already in the first link.\n\n```bash\n#You can try \"automate\" this with amass, but it's not very recommended\namass\
  \ intel -org tesla\namass intel -asn 8911,50313,394161\n```\n\nAlso, [**BBOT**](https://github.com/blacklanternsecurity/bbot)**'s**\
  \ \n enumeration automatically aggregates and summarizes ASNs at the end of the scan.\n\n```bash\nbbot -t tesla.com -f subdomain-enum\n\
  ...\n[INFO] bbot.modules.asn: +----------+---------------------+--------------+----------------+----------------------------+-----------+\n\
  [INFO] bbot.modules.asn: | AS394161 | 8.244.131.0/24      | 5            | TESLA          | Tesla Motors, Inc.         |\
  \ US        |\n[INFO] bbot.modules.asn: +----------+---------------------+--------------+----------------+----------------------------+-----------+\n\

  \ US        |\n[INFO] bbot.modules.asn: +----------+---------------------+--------------+----------------+----------------------------+-----------+\n\

  \n```\n\nYou can find the IP ranges of an organisation also using [http://asnlookup.com/](http://asnlookup.com) (it has\
  \ free API).\\\nYou can find the IP and ASN of a domain using [http://ipv4info.com/](http://ipv4info.com).\n\n### **Looking\
  \ for vulnerabilities**\n\nAt this point we know **all the assets inside the scope**, so if you are allowed you could launch\
  \ some **vulnerability scanner** (Nessus, OpenVAS, [**Nuclei**](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei)) over all the\
  \ hosts.\\\nAlso, you could launch some [**port scans**](../pentesting-network/index.html#discovering-hosts-from-the-outside)\
  \ **or use services like** Shodan, Censys, or ZoomEye **to find** open ports **and depending on what you find you should**\
  \ take a look in this book to how to pentest several possible services running.\\\n**Also, It could be worth it to mention\
  \ that you can also prepare some** default username **and** passwords **lists and try to** bruteforce services with [https://github.com/x90skysn3k/brutespray](https://github.com/x90skysn3k/brutespray).\n\
  \n## Domains\n\n> We know all the companies inside the scope and their assets, it's time to find the domains inside the\
  \ scope.\n\n_Please, note that in the following purposed techniques you can also find subdomains and that information shouldn't\
  \ be underrated._\n\nFirst of all you should look for the **main domain**(s) of each company. For example, for _Tesla Inc._\
  \ is going to be _tesla.com_.\n\n### **Reverse DNS**\n\nAs you have found all the IP ranges of the domains you could try\
  \ to perform **reverse dns lookups** on those **IPs to find more domains inside the scope**. Try to use some dns server\
  \ of the victim or some well-known dns server (1.1.1.1, 8.8.8.8)\n\n```bash\ndnsrecon -r <DNS Range> -n <IP_DNS>   #DNS\
  \ reverse of all of the addresses\ndnsrecon -d facebook.com -r 157.240.221.35/24 #Using facebooks dns\ndnsrecon -r 157.240.221.35/24\
  \ -n 1.1.1.1 #Using cloudflares dns\ndnsrecon -r 157.240.221.35/24 -n 8.8.8.8 #Using google dns\n```\n\nFor this to work,\
  \ the administrator has to enable manually the PTR.\\\nYou can also use a online tool for this info: [http://ptrarchive.com/](http://ptrarchive.com).\\\
  \nFor large ranges, tools like [**massdns**](https://github.com/blechschmidt/massdns) and [**dnsx**](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/dnsx)\
  \ are useful to automate reverse lookups and enrichment.\n\n### **Reverse Whois (loop)**\n\nInside a **whois** you can find\
  \ a lot of interesting **information** like **organisation name**, **address**, **emails**, phone numbers... But which is\
  \ even more interesting is that you can find **more assets related to the company** if you perform **reverse whois lookups\
  \ by any of those fields** (for example other whois registries where the same email appears).\\\nYou can use online tools\
  \ like:\n\n- [https://viewdns.info/reversewhois/](https://viewdns.info/reversewhois/) - **Free**\n- [https://domaineye.com/reverse-whois](https://domaineye.com/reverse-whois)\
  \ - **Free**\n- [https://www.reversewhois.io/](https://www.reversewhois.io) - **Free**\n- [https://www.whoxy.com/](https://www.whoxy.com)\
  \ - **Free** web, not free API.\n- [http://reversewhois.domaintools.com/](http://reversewhois.domaintools.com) - Not free\n\
  - [https://drs.whoisxmlapi.com/reverse-whois-search](https://drs.whoisxmlapi.com/reverse-whois-search) - Not Free (only\
  \ **100 free** searches)\n- [https://www.domainiq.com/](https://www.domainiq.com) - Not Free\n- [https://securitytrails.com/](https://securitytrails.com/)\
  \ - Not free (API)\n- [https://whoisfreaks.com/](https://whoisfreaks.com/) - Not free (API)\n\nYou can automate this task\
  \ using [**DomLink** ](https://github.com/vysecurity/DomLink)(requires a whoxy API key).\\\nYou can also perform some automatic\
  \ reverse whois discovery with [amass](https://github.com/OWASP/Amass): `amass intel -d tesla.com -whois`\n\n**Note that\
  \ you can use this technique to discover more domain names every time you find a new domain.**\n\n### **Trackers**\n\nIf\
  \ find the **same ID of the same tracker** in 2 different pages you can suppose that **both pages** are **managed by the\
  \ same team**.\\\nFor example, if you see the same **Google Analytics ID** or the same **Adsense ID** on several pages.\n\
  \nThere are some pages and tools that let you search by these trackers and more:\n\n- [**Udon**](https://github.com/dhn/udon)\n\
  - [**BuiltWith**](https://builtwith.com)\n- [**Sitesleuth**](https://www.sitesleuth.io)\n- [**Publicwww**](https://publicwww.com)\n\
  - [**SpyOnWeb**](http://spyonweb.com)\n- [**Webscout**](https://github.com/straightblast/Sc0ut) (finds related sites by\
  \ shared analytics/trackers)\n\n### **Favicon**\n\nDid you know that we can find related domains and subdomains to our target\
  \ by looking for the same favicon icon hash? This is exactly what [favihash.py](https://github.com/m4ll0k/Bug-Bounty-Toolz/blob/master/favihash.py)\
  \ tool made by [@m4ll0k2](https://twitter.com/m4ll0k2) does. Here’s how to use it:\n\n```bash\ncat my_targets.txt | xargs\
  \ -I %% bash -c 'echo \"http://%%/favicon.ico\"' > targets.txt\npython3 favihash.py -f https://target/favicon.ico -t targets.txt\
  \ -s\n```\n\n![favihash - discover domains with the same favicon icon hash](https://www.infosecmatter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/favihash.jpg)\n\
  \nSimply said, favihash will allow us to discover domains that have the same favicon icon hash as our target.\n\nMoreover,\
  \ you can also search technologies using the favicon hash as explained in [**this blog post**](https://medium.com/@Asm0d3us/weaponizing-favicon-ico-for-bugbounties-osint-and-what-not-ace3c214e139).\
  \ That means that if you know the **hash of the favicon of a vulnerable version of a web tech** you can search if in shodan\
  \ and **find more vulnerable places**:\n\n```bash\nshodan search org:\"Target\" http.favicon.hash:116323821 --fields ip_str,port\
  \ --separator \" \" | awk '{print $1\":\"$2}'\n```\n\nThis is how you can **calculate the favicon hash** of a web:\n\n```python\n\
  import mmh3\nimport requests\nimport codecs\n\ndef fav_hash(url):\n    response = requests.get(url)\n    favicon = codecs.encode(response.content,\"\
  base64\")\n    fhash = mmh3.hash(favicon)\n    print(f\"{url} : {fhash}\")\n    return fhash\n```\n\nYou can also get favicon\
  \ hashes at scale with [**httpx**](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/httpx) (`httpx -l targets.txt -favicon`) and then\
  \ pivot in Shodan/Censys.\n\n### **Copyright / Uniq string**\n\nSearch inside the web pages **strings that could be shared\
  \ across different webs in the same organisation**. The **copyright string** could be a good example. Then search for that\
  \ string in **google**, in other **browsers** or even in **shodan**: `shodan search http.html:\"Copyright string\"`\n\n\
  ### **CRT Time**\n\nIt's common to have a cron job such as\n\n```bash\n# /etc/crontab\n37 13 */10 * * certbot renew --post-hook\
  \ \"systemctl reload nginx\"\n```\n\nto renew the all the domain certificates on the server. This means that even if the\
  \ CA used for this doesn't set the time it was generated in the Validity time, it's possible to **find domains belonging\
  \ to the same company in the certificate transparency logs**.\\\nCheck out this [**writeup for more information**](https://swarm.ptsecurity.com/discovering-domains-via-a-time-correlation-attack/).\n\
  \nAlso use **certificate transparency** logs directly:\n\n- [https://crt.sh/](https://crt.sh/)\n- [https://certspotter.com/](https://certspotter.com/)\n\
  - [https://search.censys.io/](https://search.censys.io/)\n- [https://chaos.projectdiscovery.io/](https://chaos.projectdiscovery.io/)\
  \ + [**chaos-client**](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/chaos-client)\n\n### Mail DMARC information\n\nYou can use a\
  \ web such as [https://dmarc.live/info/google.com](https://dmarc.live/info/google.com) or a tool such as [https://github.com/Tedixx/dmarc-subdomains](https://github.com/Tedixx/dmarc-subdomains)\
  \ to find **domains and subdomain sharing the same dmarc information**.\\\nOther useful tools are [**spoofcheck**](https://github.com/BishopFox/spoofcheck)\
  \ and [**dmarcian**](https://dmarcian.com/).\n\n### **Passive Takeover**\n\nApparently is common for people to assign subdomains\
  \ to IPs that belongs to cloud providers and at some point **lose that IP address but forget about removing the DNS record**.\
  \ Therefore, just **spawning a VM** in a cloud (like Digital Ocean) you will be actually **taking over some subdomains(s)**.\n\
  \n[**This post**](https://kmsec.uk/blog/passive-takeover/) explains a store about it and propose a script that **spawns\
  \ a VM in DigitalOcean**, **gets** the **IPv4** of the new machine, and **searches in Virustotal for subdomain records**\
  \ pointing to it.\n\n### **Other ways**\n\n**Note that you can use this technique to discover more domain names every time\
  \ you find a new domain.**\n\n**Shodan**\n\nAs you already know the name of the organisation owning the IP space. You can\
  \ search by that data in shodan using: `org:\"Tesla, Inc.\"` Check the found hosts for new unexpected domains in the TLS\
  \ certificate.\n\nYou could access the **TLS certificate** of the main web page, obtain the **Organisation name** and then\
  \ search for that name inside the **TLS certificates** of all the web pages known by **shodan** with the filter : `ssl:\"\
  Tesla Motors\"` or use a tool like [**sslsearch**](https://github.com/HarshVaragiya/sslsearch).\n\n**Assetfinder**\n\n[**Assetfinder**\
  \ ](https://github.com/tomnomnom/assetfinder)is a tool that looks for **domains related** with a main domain and **subdomains**\
  \ of them, pretty amazing.\n\n**Passive DNS / Historical DNS**\n\nPassive DNS data is great to find **old and forgotten\
  \ records** that still resolve or that can be taken over. Look at:\n\n- [https://securitytrails.com/](https://securitytrails.com/)\n\
  - [https://community.riskiq.com/](https://community.riskiq.com/) (PassiveTotal)\n- [https://www.domaintools.com/products/iris/](https://www.domaintools.com/products/iris/)\n\
  - [https://www.farsightsecurity.com/solutions/dnsdb/](https://www.farsightsecurity.com/solutions/dnsdb/)\n\n### **Looking\
  \ for vulnerabilities**\n\nCheck for some [domain takeover](../../pentesting-web/domain-subdomain-takeover.md#domain-takeover).\
  \ Maybe some company is **using some a domain** but they **lost the ownership**. Just register it (if cheap enough) and\
  \ let know the company.\n\nIf you find any **domain with an IP different** from the ones you already found in the assets\
  \ discovery, you should perform a **basic vulnerability scan** (using Nessus or OpenVAS) and some [**port scan**](../pentesting-network/index.html#discovering-hosts-from-the-outside)\
  \ with **nmap/masscan/shodan**. Depending on which services are running you can find in **this book some tricks to \"attack\"\
  \ them**.\\\n_Note that sometimes the domain is hosted inside an IP that is not controlled by the client, so it's not in\
  \ the scope, be careful._\n\n## Subdomains\n\n> We know all the companies inside the scope, all the assets of each company\
  \ and all the domains related to the companies.\n\nIt's time to find all the possible subdomains of each found domain.\n\
  \n> [!TIP]\n> Note that some of the tools and techniques to find domains can also help to find subdomains\n\n### **DNS**\n\
  \nLet's try to get **subdomains** from the **DNS** records. We should also try for **Zone Transfer** (If vulnerable, you\
  \ should report it).\n\n```bash\ndnsrecon -a -d tesla.com\n```\n\n### **OSINT**\n\nThe fastest way to obtain a lot of subdomains\
  \ is search in external sources. The most used **tools** are the following ones (for better results configure the API keys):\n\
  \n- [**BBOT**](https://github.com/blacklanternsecurity/bbot)\n\n```bash\n# subdomains\nbbot -t tesla.com -f subdomain-enum\n\
  \n# subdomains (passive only)\nbbot -t tesla.com -f subdomain-enum -rf passive\n\n# subdomains + port scan + web screenshots\n\
  bbot -t tesla.com -f subdomain-enum -m naabu gowitness -n my_scan -o .\n```\n\n- [**Amass**](https://github.com/OWASP/Amass)\n\
  \n```bash\namass enum [-active] [-ip] -d tesla.com\namass enum -d tesla.com | grep tesla.com # To just list subdomains\n\
  ```\n\n- [**subfinder**](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/subfinder)\n\n```bash\n# Subfinder, use -silent to only have\
  \ subdomains in the output\n./subfinder-linux-amd64 -d tesla.com [-silent]\n```\n\n- [**findomain**](https://github.com/Edu4rdSHL/findomain/)\n\
  \n```bash\n# findomain, use -silent to only have subdomains in the output\n./findomain-linux -t tesla.com [--quiet]\n```\n\
  \n- [**OneForAll**](https://github.com/shmilylty/OneForAll/tree/master/docs/en-us)\n\n```bash\npython3 oneforall.py --target\
  \ tesla.com [--dns False] [--req False] [--brute False] run\n```\n\n- [**assetfinder**](https://github.com/tomnomnom/assetfinder)\n\
  \n```bash\nassetfinder --subs-only <domain>\n```\n\n- [**Sudomy**](https://github.com/Screetsec/Sudomy)\n\n```bash\n# It\
  \ requires that you create a sudomy.api file with API keys\nsudomy -d tesla.com\n```\n\n- [**vita**](https://github.com/junnlikestea/vita)\n\
  \n```\nvita -d tesla.com\n```\n\n- [**theHarvester**](https://github.com/laramies/theHarvester)\n\n```bash\ntheHarvester\

  \ in finding subdomains could be useful to find subdomains, like:\n\n- [**Crobat**](https://github.com/cgboal/sonarsearch)**:**\
  \ Uses the API [https://sonar.omnisint.io](https://sonar.omnisint.io) to obtain subdomains\n\n```bash\n# Get list of subdomains\
  \ in output from the API\n## This is the API the crobat tool will use\ncurl https://sonar.omnisint.io/subdomains/tesla.com\

  \ | cut -d \"/\" -f 3 | sort -u\n```\n\n- [**SubDomainizer**](https://github.com/nsonaniya2010/SubDomainizer) **&** [**subscraper**](https://github.com/Cillian-Collins/subscraper):\
  \ They scrap the web looking for JS files and extract subdomains from there.\n\n```bash\n# Get only subdomains from SubDomainizer\n\
  python3 SubDomainizer.py -u https://tesla.com | grep tesla.com\n\n# Get only subdomains from subscraper, this already perform\

  - [**securitytrails.com**](https://securitytrails.com/) has a free API to search for subdomains and IP history\n- [**chaos.projectdiscovery.io**](https://chaos.projectdiscovery.io/#/)\n\
  \nThis project offers for **free all the subdomains related to bug-bounty programs**. You can access this data also using\
  \ [chaospy](https://github.com/dr-0x0x/chaospy) or even access the scope used by this project [https://github.com/projectdiscovery/chaos-public-program-list](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/chaos-public-program-list)\n\
  \nYou can find a **comparison** of many of these tools here: [https://blog.blacklanternsecurity.com/p/subdomain-enumeration-tool-face-off](https://blog.blacklanternsecurity.com/p/subdomain-enumeration-tool-face-off)\n\
  \n### **DNS Brute force**\n\nLet's try to find new **subdomains** brute-forcing DNS servers using possible subdomain names.\n\
  \nFor this action you will need some **common subdomains wordlists like**:\n\n- [https://gist.github.com/jhaddix/86a06c5dc309d08580a018c66354a056](https://gist.github.com/jhaddix/86a06c5dc309d08580a018c66354a056)\n\

  \nAnd also IPs of good DNS resolvers. In order to generate a list of trusted DNS resolvers you can download the resolvers\
  \ from [https://public-dns.info/nameservers-all.txt](https://public-dns.info/nameservers-all.txt) and use [**dnsvalidator**](https://github.com/vortexau/dnsvalidator)\
  \ to filter them. Or you could use: [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trickest/resolvers/main/resolvers-trusted.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trickest/resolvers/main/resolvers-trusted.txt)\n\
  \nThe most recommended tools for DNS brute-force are:\n\n- [**massdns**](https://github.com/blechschmidt/massdns): This\
  \ was the first tool that performed an effective DNS brute-force. It's very fast however it's prone to false positives.\n\
  \n```bash\nsed 's/$/.domain.com/' subdomains.txt > bf-subdomains.txt\n./massdns -r resolvers.txt -w /tmp/results.txt bf-subdomains.txt\n\
  grep -E \"tesla.com. [0-9]+ IN A .+\" /tmp/results.txt\n```\n\n- [**gobuster**](https://github.com/OJ/gobuster): This one\
  \ I think just uses 1 resolver\n\n```\ngobuster dns -d mysite.com -t 50 -w subdomains.txt\n```\n\n- [**shuffledns**](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/shuffledns)\
  \ is a wrapper around `massdns`, written in go, that allows you to enumerate valid subdomains using active bruteforce, as\
  \ well as resolve subdomains with wildcard handling and easy input-output support.\n\n```\nshuffledns -d example.com -list\
  \ example-subdomains.txt -r resolvers.txt\n```\n\n- [**puredns**](https://github.com/d3mondev/puredns): It also uses `massdns`.\n\
  \n```\npuredns bruteforce all.txt domain.com\n```\n\n- [**aiodnsbrute**](https://github.com/blark/aiodnsbrute) uses asyncio\
  \ to brute force domain names asynchronously.\n\n```\naiodnsbrute -r resolvers -w wordlist.txt -vv -t 1024 domain.com\n\
  ```\n\n### Second DNS Brute-Force Round\n\nAfter having found subdomains using open sources and brute-forcing, you could\
  \ generate alterations of the subdomains found to try to find even more. Several tools are useful for this purpose:\n\n\
  - [**dnsgen**](https://github.com/ProjectAnte/dnsgen)**:** Given the domains and subdomains generate permutations.\n\n```bash\n\
  cat subdomains.txt | dnsgen -\n```\n\n- [**goaltdns**](https://github.com/subfinder/goaltdns): Given the domains and subdomains\
  \ generate permutations.\n  - You can get goaltdns permutations **wordlist** in [**here**](https://github.com/subfinder/goaltdns/blob/master/words.txt).\n\
  \n```bash\ngoaltdns -l subdomains.txt -w /tmp/words-permutations.txt -o /tmp/final-words-s3.txt\n```\n\n- [**gotator**](https://github.com/Josue87/gotator)**:**\
  \ Given the domains and subdomains generate permutations. If not permutations file is indicated gotator will use its own\
  \ one.\n\n```\ngotator -sub subdomains.txt -silent [-perm /tmp/words-permutations.txt]\n```\n\n- [**altdns**](https://github.com/infosec-au/altdns):\
  \ Apart from generating subdomains permutations, it can also try to resolve them (but it's better to use the previous commented\
  \ tools).\n  - You can get altdns permutations **wordlist** in [**here**](https://github.com/infosec-au/altdns/blob/master/words.txt).\n\
  \n```\naltdns -i subdomains.txt -w /tmp/words-permutations.txt -o /tmp/asd3\n```\n\n- [**dmut**](https://github.com/bp0lr/dmut):\
  \ Another tool to perform permutations, mutations and alteration of subdomains. This tool will brute force the result (it\
  \ doesn't support dns wild card).\n  - You can get dmut permutations wordlist in [**here**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bp0lr/dmut/main/words.txt).\n\
  \n```bash\ncat subdomains.txt | dmut -d /tmp/words-permutations.txt -w 100 \\\n    --dns-errorLimit 10 --use-pb --verbose\
  \ -s /tmp/resolvers-trusted.txt\n```\n\n- [**alterx**](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/alterx)**:** Based on a domain\
  \ it **generates new potential subdomains names** based on indicated patterns to try to discover more subdomains.\n\n####\
  \ Smart permutations generation\n\n- [**regulator**](https://github.com/cramppet/regulator): For more info read this [**post**](https://cramppet.github.io/regulator/index.html)\
  \ but it will basically get the **main parts** from the **discovered subdomains** and will mix them to find more subdomains.\n\
  \n```bash\npython3 main.py adobe.com adobe adobe.rules\nmake_brute_list.sh adobe.rules adobe.brute\npuredns resolve adobe.brute\
  \ --write adobe.valid\n```\n\n- [**subzuf**](https://github.com/elceef/subzuf)**:** _subzuf_ is a subdomain brute-force\
  \ fuzzer coupled with an immensly simple but effective DNS reponse-guided algorithm. It utilizes a provided set of input\
  \ data, like a tailored wordlist or historical DNS/TLS records, to accurately synthesize more corresponding domain names\
  \ and expand them even further in a loop based on information gathered during DNS scan.\n\n```\necho www | subzuf facebook.com\n\
  ```\n\n### **Subdomain Discovery Workflow**\n\nCheck this blog post I wrote about how to **automate the subdomain discovery**\
  \ from a domain using **Trickest workflows** so I don't need to launch manually a bunch of tools in my computer:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\n\
  https://trickest.com/blog/full-subdomain-discovery-using-workflow/\n{{#endref}}\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nhttps://trickest.com/blog/full-subdomain-brute-force-discovery-using-workflow/\n\
  {{#endref}}\n\n### **VHosts / Virtual Hosts**\n\nIf you found an IP address containing **one or several web pages** belonging\
  \ to subdomains, you could try to **find other subdomains with webs in that IP** by looking in **OSINT sources** for domains\
  \ in an IP or by **brute-forcing VHost domain names in that IP**.\n\n#### OSINT\n\nYou can find some **VHosts in IPs using**\
  \ [**HostHunter**](https://github.com/SpiderLabs/HostHunter) **or other APIs**.\n\n**Brute Force**\n\nIf you suspect that\
  \ some subdomain can be hidden in a web server you could try to brute force it:\n\nWhen the **IP redirects to a hostname**\
  \ (name-based vhosts), fuzz the `Host` header directly and let ffuf **auto-calibrate** to highlight responses that differ\
  \ from the default vhost:\n\n```bash\nffuf -u http://10.10.10.10 -H \"Host: FUZZ.example.com\" \\\n  -w /opt/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-20000.txt\
  \ -ac\n```\n\n```bash\nffuf -c -w /path/to/wordlist -u http://victim.com -H \"Host: FUZZ.victim.com\"\n\ngobuster vhost\
  \ -u https://mysite.com -t 50 -w subdomains.txt\n\nwfuzz -c -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-20000.txt\
  \ --hc 400,404,403 -H \"Host: FUZZ.example.com\" -u http://example.com -t 100\n\n#From https://github.com/allyshka/vhostbrute\n\
  vhostbrute.py --url=\"example.com\" --remoteip=\"10.1.1.15\" --base=\"www.example.com\" --vhosts=\"vhosts_full.list\"\n\n\
  #https://github.com/codingo/VHostScan\nVHostScan -t example.com\n```\n\n> [!TIP]\n> With this technique you may even be\
  \ able to access internal/hidden endpoints.\n\n### **CORS Brute Force**\n\nSometimes you will find pages that only return\
  \ the header _**Access-Control-Allow-Origin**_ when a valid domain/subdomain is set in the _**Origin**_ header. In these\
  \ scenarios, you can abuse this behaviour to **discover** new **subdomains**.\n\n```bash\nffuf -w subdomains-top1million-5000.txt\
  \ -u http://10.10.10.208 -H 'Origin: http://FUZZ.crossfit.htb' -mr \"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\" -ignore-body\n```\n\n\
  ### **Buckets Brute Force**\n\nWhile looking for **subdomains** keep an eye to see if it is **pointing** to any type of\
  \ **bucket**, and in that case [**check the permissions**](../../network-services-pentesting/pentesting-web/buckets/index.html)**.**\\\
  \nAlso, as at this point you will know all the domains inside the scope, try to [**brute force possible bucket names and\
  \ check the permissions**](../../network-services-pentesting/pentesting-web/buckets/index.html).\n\n### **Monitorization**\n\
  \nYou can **monitor** if **new subdomains** of a domain are created by monitoring the **Certificate Transparency** Logs\
  \ [**sublert** ](https://github.com/yassineaboukir/sublert/blob/master/sublert.py)does.\n\n### **Looking for vulnerabilities**\n\
  \nCheck for possible [**subdomain takeovers**](../../pentesting-web/domain-subdomain-takeover.md#subdomain-takeover).\\\n\
  If the **subdomain** is pointing to some **S3 bucket**, [**check the permissions**](../../network-services-pentesting/pentesting-web/buckets/index.html).\n\
  \nIf you find any **subdomain with an IP different** from the ones you already found in the assets discovery, you should\
  \ perform a **basic vulnerability scan** (using Nessus or OpenVAS) and some [**port scan**](../pentesting-network/index.html#discovering-hosts-from-the-outside)\
  \ with **nmap/masscan/shodan**. Depending on which services are running you can find in **this book some tricks to \"attack\"\
  \ them**.\\\n_Note that sometimes the subdomain is hosted inside an IP that is not controlled by the client, so it's not\
  \ in the scope, be careful._\n\n## IPs\n\nIn the initial steps you might have **found some IP ranges, domains and subdomains**.\\\
  \nIt’s time to **recollect all the IPs from those ranges** and for the **domains/subdomains (DNS queries).**\n\nUsing services\
  \ from the following **free apis** you can also find **previous IPs used by domains and subdomains**. These IPs might still\
  \ be owned by the client (and might allow you to find [**CloudFlare bypasses**](../../network-services-pentesting/pentesting-web/uncovering-cloudflare.md))\n\
  \n- [**https://securitytrails.com/**](https://securitytrails.com/)\n\nYou can also check for domains pointing a specific\
  \ IP address using the tool [**hakip2host**](https://github.com/hakluke/hakip2host)\n\n### **Looking for vulnerabilities**\n\
  \n**Port scan all the IPs that doesn’t belong to CDNs** (as you highly probably won’t find anything interested in there).\
  \ In the running services discovered you might be **able to find vulnerabilities**.\n\n**Find a** [**guide**](../pentesting-network/index.html)\
  \ **about how to scan hosts.**\n\n## Web servers hunting\n\n> We have found all the companies and their assets and we know\
  \ IP ranges, domains and subdomains inside the scope. It's time to search for web servers.\n\nIn the previous steps you\
  \ have probably already performed some **recon of the IPs and domains discovered**, so you may have **already found all\
  \ the possible web servers**. However, if you haven't we are now going to see some **fast tricks to search for web servers**\
  \ inside the scope.\n\nPlease, note that this will be **oriented for web apps discovery**, so you should **perform the vulnerability**\
  \ and **port scanning** also (**if allowed** by the scope).\n\nA **fast method** to discover **ports open** related to **web**\
  \ servers using [**masscan** can be found here](../pentesting-network/index.html#http-port-discovery).\\\nAnother friendly\
  \ tool to look for web servers is [**httprobe**](https://github.com/tomnomnom/httprobe)**,** [**fprobe**](https://github.com/theblackturtle/fprobe)\
  \ and [**httpx**](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/httpx). You just pass a list of domains and it will try to connect\
  \ to port 80 (http) and 443 (https). Additionally, you can indicate to try other ports:\n\n```bash\ncat /tmp/domains.txt\
  \ | httprobe #Test all domains inside the file for port 80 and 443\ncat /tmp/domains.txt | httprobe -p http:8080 -p https:8443\
  \ #Check port 80, 443 and 8080 and 8443\n```\n\n### **Screenshots**\n\nNow that you have discovered **all the web servers**\
  \ present in the scope (among the **IPs** of the company and all the **domains** and **subdomains**) you probably **don't\
  \ know where to start**. So, let's make it simple and start just taking screenshots of all of them. Just by **taking a look**\
  \ at the **main page** you can find **weird** endpoints that are more **prone** to be **vulnerable**.\n\nTo perform the\
  \ proposed idea you can use [**EyeWitness**](https://github.com/FortyNorthSecurity/EyeWitness), [**HttpScreenshot**](https://github.com/breenmachine/httpscreenshot),\
  \ [**Aquatone**](https://github.com/michenriksen/aquatone), [**Shutter**](https://shutter-project.org/downloads/third-party-packages/),\
  \ [**Gowitness**](https://github.com/sensepost/gowitness) or [**webscreenshot**](https://github.com/maaaaz/webscreenshot)**.**\n\
  \nMoreover, you could then use [**eyeballer**](https://github.com/BishopFox/eyeballer) to run over all the **screenshots**\
  \ to tell you **what's likely to contain vulnerabilities**, and what isn't.\n\n## Public Cloud Assets\n\nIn order to find\
  \ potential cloud assets belonging to a company you should **start with a list of keywords that identify that company**.\
  \ For example, a crypto for a crypto company you might use words such as: `\"crypto\", \"wallet\", \"dao\", \"<domain_name>\"\
  , <\"subdomain_names\">`.\n\nYou will also need wordlists of **common words used in buckets**:\n\n- [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cujanovic/goaltdns/master/words.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cujanovic/goaltdns/master/words.txt)\n\
  - [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/infosec-au/altdns/master/words.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/infosec-au/altdns/master/words.txt)\n\
  - [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jordanpotti/AWSBucketDump/master/BucketNames.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jordanpotti/AWSBucketDump/master/BucketNames.txt)\n\
  \nThen, with those words you should generate **permutations** (check the [**Second Round DNS Brute-Force**](#second-dns-bruteforce-round)\
  \ for more info).\n\nWith the resulting wordlists you could use tools such as [**cloud_enum**](https://github.com/initstring/cloud_enum)**,**\
  \ [**CloudScraper**](https://github.com/jordanpotti/CloudScraper)**,** [**cloudlist**](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/cloudlist)\
  \ **or** [**S3Scanner**](https://github.com/sa7mon/S3Scanner)**.**\n\nRemember that when looking for Cloud Assets you should\
  \ l**ook for more than just buckets in AWS**.\n\n### **Looking for vulnerabilities**\n\nIf you find things such as **open\
  \ buckets or cloud functions exposed** you should **access them** and try to see what they offer you and if you can abuse\
  \ them.\n\n## Emails\n\nWith the **domains** and **subdomains** inside the scope you basically have all what you **need\
  \ to start searching for emails**. These are the **APIs** and **tools** that have worked the best for me to find emails\
  \ of a company:\n\n- [**theHarvester**](https://github.com/laramies/theHarvester) - with APIs\n- API of [**https://hunter.io/**](https://hunter.io/)\
  \ (free version)\n- API of [**https://app.snov.io/**](https://app.snov.io/) (free version)\n- API of [**https://minelead.io/**](https://minelead.io/)\
  \ (free version)\n\n### **Looking for vulnerabilities**\n\nEmails will come handy later to **brute-force web logins and\
  \ auth services** (such as SSH). Also, they are needed for **phishings**. Moreover, these APIs will give you even more **info\
  \ about the person** behind the email, which is useful for the phishing campaign.\n\n## Credential Leaks\n\nWith the **domains,**\
  \ **subdomains**, and **emails** you can start looking for credentials leaked in the past belonging to those emails:\n\n\
  - [https://leak-lookup.com](https://leak-lookup.com/account/login)\n- [https://www.dehashed.com/](https://www.dehashed.com/)\n\
  \n### **Looking for vulnerabilities**\n\nIf you find **valid leaked** credentials, this is a very easy win.\n\n## Secrets\
  \ Leaks\n\nCredential leaks are related to hacks of companies where **sensitive information was leaked and sold**. However,\
  \ companies might be affected for **other leaks** whose info isn't in those databases:\n\n### Github Leaks\n\nCredentials\
  \ and APIs might be leaked in the **public repositories** of the **company** or of the **users** working by that github\
  \ company.\\\nYou can use the **tool** [**Leakos**](https://github.com/carlospolop/Leakos) to **download** all the **public\
  \ repos** of an **organization** and of its **developers** and run [**gitleaks**](https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks)\
  \ over them automatically.\n\n**Leakos** can also be used to run **gitleaks** agains all the **text** provided **URLs passed**\
  \ to it as sometimes **web pages also contains secrets**.\n\n#### Github Dorks\n\nCheck also this **page** for potential\
  \ **github dorks** you could also search for in the organization you are attacking:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\ngithub-leaked-secrets.md\n\
  {{#endref}}\n\n### Pastes Leaks\n\nSometimes attackers or just workers will **publish company content in a paste site**.\
  \ This might or might not contain **sensitive information**, but it's very interesting to search for it.\\\nYou can use\
  \ the tool [**Pastos**](https://github.com/carlospolop/Pastos) to search in more that 80 paste sites at the same time.\n\
  \n### Google Dorks\n\nOld but gold google dorks are always useful to find **exposed information that shouldn't be there**.\
  \ The only problem is that the [**google-hacking-database**](https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database) contains\
  \ several **thousands** of possible queries that you cannot run manually. So, you can get your favourite 10 ones or you\
  \ could use a **tool such as** [**Gorks**](https://github.com/carlospolop/Gorks) **to run them all**.\n\n_Note that the\
  \ tools that expect to run all the database using the regular Google browser will never end as google will block you very\
  \ very soon._\n\n### **Looking for vulnerabilities**\n\nIf you find **valid leaked** credentials or API tokens, this is\
  \ a very easy win.\n\n## Public Code Vulnerabilities\n\nIf you found that the company has **open-source code** you can **analyse**\
  \ it and search for **vulnerabilities** on it.\n\n**Depending on the language** there are different **tools** you can use:\n\
  \n\n{{#ref}}\n../../network-services-pentesting/pentesting-web/code-review-tools.md\n{{#endref}}\n\nThere are also free\
  \ services that allow you to **scan public repositories**, such as:\n\n- [**Snyk**](https://app.snyk.io/)\n\n## [**Pentesting\
  \ Web Methodology**](../../network-services-pentesting/pentesting-web/index.html)\n\nThe **majority of the vulnerabilities**\
  \ found by bug hunters resides inside **web applications**, so at this point I would like to talk about a **web application\
  \ testing methodology**, and you can [**find this information here**](../../network-services-pentesting/pentesting-web/index.html).\n\
  \nI also want to do a special mention to the section [**Web Automated Scanners open source tools**](../../network-services-pentesting/pentesting-web/index.html#automatic-scanners),\
  \ as, if you shouldn't expect them to find you very sensitive vulnerabilities, they come handy to implement them on **workflows\
  \ to have some initial web information.**\n\n## Recapitulation\n\n> Congratulations! At this point you have already perform\
  \ **all the basic enumeration**. Yes, it's basic because a lot more enumeration can be done (will see more tricks later).\n\
  \nSo you have already:\n\n1. Found all the **companies** inside the scope\n2. Found all the **assets** belonging to the\
  \ companies (and perform some vuln scan if in scope)\n3. Found all the **domains** belonging to the companies\n4. Found\
  \ all the **subdomains** of the domains (any subdomain takeover?)\n5. Found all the **IPs** (from and **not from CDNs**)\
  \ inside the scope.\n6. Found all the **web servers** and took a **screenshot** of them (anything weird worth a deeper look?)\n\
  7. Found all the **potential public cloud assets** belonging to the company.\n8. **Emails**, **credentials leaks**, and\
  \ **secret leaks** that could give you a **big win very easily**.\n9. **Pentesting all the webs you found**\n\n## **Full\
  \ Recon Automatic Tools**\n\nThere are several tools out there that will perform part of the proposed actions against a\
  \ given scope.\n\n- [**https://github.com/yogeshojha/rengine**](https://github.com/yogeshojha/rengine)\n- [**https://github.com/j3ssie/Osmedeus**](https://github.com/j3ssie/Osmedeus)\n\
