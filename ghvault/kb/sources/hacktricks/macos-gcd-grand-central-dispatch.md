_body: "# macOS GCD - Grand Central Dispatch\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n## Basic Information\n\
  \n**Grand Central Dispatch (GCD),** also known as **libdispatch** (`libdispatch.dyld`), is available in both macOS and iOS.\
  \ It's a technology developed by Apple to optimize application support for concurrent (multithreaded) execution on multicore\
  \ hardware.\n\n**GCD** provides and manages **FIFO queues** to which your application can **submit tasks** in the form of\
  \ **block objects**. Blocks submitted to dispatch queues are **executed on a pool of threads** fully managed by the system.\
  \ GCD automatically creates threads for executing the tasks in the dispatch queues and schedules those tasks to run on the\
  \ available cores.\n\n> [!TIP]\n> In summary, to execute code in **parallel**, processes can send **blocks of code to GCD**,\
  \ which will take care of their execution. Therefore, processes don't create new threads; **GCD executes the given code\
  \ with its own pool of threads** (which might increase or decrease as necessary).\n\nThis is very helpful to manage parallel\
  \ execution successfully, greatly reducing the number of threads processes create and optimising the parallel execution.\
  \ This is ideal for tasks that require **great parallelism** (brute-forcing?) or for tasks that shouldn't block the main\
  \ thread: For example, the main thread on iOS handles UI interactions, so any other functionality that could make the app\
  \ hang (searching, accessing a web, reading a file...) is managed this way.\n\n### Blocks\n\nA block is a **self contained\
  \ section of code** (like a function with arguments returning a value) and can also specify bound variables.\\\nHowever,\
  \ at compiler level blocks doesn't exist, they are `os_object`s. Each of these objects is formed by two structures:\n\n\
  - **block literal**:\n  - It starts by the **`isa`** field, pointing to the block's class:\n    - `NSConcreteGlobalBlock`\
  \ (blocks from `__DATA.__const`)\n    - `NSConcreteMallocBlock` (blocks in the heap)\n    - `NSConcreateStackBlock` (blocks\
  \ in stack)\n  - It has **`flags`** (indicating fields present in the block descriptor) and some reserved bytes\n  - The\
  \ function pointer to call\n  - A pointer to the block descriptor\n  - Block imported variables (if any)\n- **block descriptor**:\
  \ It's size depends on the data that is present (as indicated in the previous flags)\n  - It has some reserved bytes\n \
  \ - The size of it\n  - It'll usually have a pointer to an Objective-C style signature to know how much space is needed\
  \ for the params (flag `BLOCK_HAS_SIGNATURE`)\n  - If variables are referenced, this block will also have pointers to a\
  \ copy helper (copying the value at the begining) and dispose helper (freeing it).\n\n### Queues\n\nA dispatch queue is\
  \ a named object providing FIFO ordering of blocks for executions.\n\nBlocks a set in queues to be executed, and these support\
  \ 2 modes: `DISPATCH_QUEUE_SERIAL` and `DISPATCH_QUEUE_CONCURRENT`. Of course the **serial** one **won't have race condition**\
  \ problems as a block won't be executed until the previous one has finished. But **the other type of queue might have it**.\n\
  \nDefault queues:\n\n- `.main-thread`: From `dispatch_get_main_queue()`\n- `.libdispatch-manager`: GCD's queue manager\n\
  - `.root.libdispatch-manager`: GCD's queue manager\n- `.root.maintenance-qos`: Lowest priority tasks\n- `.root.maintenance-qos.overcommit`\n\
  - `.root.background-qos`: Available as `DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_BACKGROUND`\n- `.root.background-qos.overcommit`\n- `.root.utility-qos`:\
  \ Available as `DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_NON_INTERACTIVE`\n- `.root.utility-qos.overcommit`\n- `.root.default-qos`: Available\
  \ as `DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_DEFAULT`\n- `.root.background-qos.overcommit`\n- `.root.user-initiated-qos`: Available as\
  \ `DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_HIGH`\n- `.root.background-qos.overcommit`\n- `.root.user-interactive-qos`: Highest priority\n\
  - `.root.background-qos.overcommit`\n\nNotice that it will be the system who decides **which threads handle which queues\
  \ at each time** (multiple threads might work in the same queue or the same thread might work in different queues at some\
  \ point)\n\n#### Attributtes\n\nWhen creating a queue with **`dispatch_queue_create`** the third argument is a `dispatch_queue_attr_t`,\
  \ which usually is either `DISPATCH_QUEUE_SERIAL` (which is actually NULL) or `DISPATCH_QUEUE_CONCURRENT` which is a pointer\
  \ to a `dispatch_queue_attr_t` struct which allow to control some parameters of the queue.\n\n### Dispatch objects\n\nThere\
  \ are several objects that libdispatch uses and queues and blocks are just 2 of them. It's possible to create these objects\
  \ with `dispatch_object_create`:\n\n- `block`\n- `data`: Data blocks\n- `group`: Group of blocks\n- `io`: Async I/O requests\n\
  - `mach`: Mach ports\n- `mach_msg`: Mach messages\n- `pthread_root_queue`:A queue with a pthread thread pool and not workqueues\n\
  - `queue`\n- `semaphore`\n- `source`: Event source\n\n## Objective-C\n\nIn Objetive-C there are different functions to send\
  \ a block to be executed in parallel:\n\n- [**dispatch_async**](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/dispatch/1453057-dispatch_async):\
  \ Submits a block for asynchronous execution on a dispatch queue and returns immediately.\n- [**dispatch_sync**](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/dispatch/1452870-dispatch_sync):\
  \ Submits a block object for execution and returns after that block finishes executing.\n- [**dispatch_once**](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/dispatch/1447169-dispatch_once):\
  \ Executes a block object only once for the lifetime of an application.\n- [**dispatch_async_and_wait**](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/dispatch/3191901-dispatch_async_and_wait):\
  \ Submits a work item for execution and returns only after it finishes executing. Unlike [**`dispatch_sync`**](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/dispatch/1452870-dispatch_sync),\
  \ this function respects all attributes of the queue when it executes the block.\n\nThese functions expect these parameters:\
  \ [**`dispatch_queue_t`**](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/dispatch/dispatch_queue_t) **`queue,`** [**`dispatch_block_t`**](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/dispatch/dispatch_block_t)\
  \ **`block`**\n\nThis is the **struct of a Block**:\n\n```c\nstruct Block {\n   void *isa; // NSConcreteStackBlock,...\n\
  \   int flags;\n   int reserved;\n   void *invoke;\n   struct BlockDescriptor *descriptor;\n   // captured variables go\
  \ here\n};\n```\n\nAnd this is an example to use **parallelism** with **`dispatch_async`**:\n\n```objectivec\n#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>\n\
  \n// Define a block\nvoid (^backgroundTask)(void) = ^{\n    // Code to be executed in the background\n    for (int i = 0;\
  \ i < 10; i++) {\n        NSLog(@\"Background task %d\", i);\n        sleep(1);  // Simulate a long-running task\n    }\n\
  };\n\nint main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {\n    @autoreleasepool {\n        // Create a dispatch queue\n        dispatch_queue_t\
  \ backgroundQueue = dispatch_queue_create(\"com.example.backgroundQueue\", NULL);\n\n        // Submit the block to the\
  \ queue for asynchronous execution\n        dispatch_async(backgroundQueue, backgroundTask);\n\n        // Continue with\
  \ other work on the main queue or thread\n        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n            NSLog(@\"Main task %d\", i);\n\
  \            sleep(1);  // Simulate a long-running task\n        }\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n## Swift\n\n**`libswiftDispatch`**\
  \ is a library that provides **Swift bindings** to the Grand Central Dispatch (GCD) framework which is originally written\
  \ in C.\\\nThe **`libswiftDispatch`** library wraps the C GCD APIs in a more Swift-friendly interface, making it easier\
  \ and more intuitive for Swift developers to work with GCD.\n\n- **`DispatchQueue.global().sync{ ... }`**\n- **`DispatchQueue.global().async{\
  \ ... }`**\n- **`let onceToken = DispatchOnce(); onceToken.perform { ... }`**\n- **`async await`**\n  - **`var (data, response)\
  \ = await URLSession.shared.data(from: URL(string: \"https://api.example.com/getData\"))`**\n\n**Code example**:\n\n```swift\n\
  import Foundation\n\n// Define a closure (the Swift equivalent of a block)\nlet backgroundTask: () -> Void = {\n    for\
  \ i in 0..<10 {\n        print(\"Background task \\(i)\")\n        sleep(1)  // Simulate a long-running task\n    }\n}\n\
  \n// Entry point\nautoreleasepool {\n    // Create a dispatch queue\n    let backgroundQueue = DispatchQueue(label: \"com.example.backgroundQueue\"\
  )\n\n    // Submit the closure to the queue for asynchronous execution\n    backgroundQueue.async(execute: backgroundTask)\n\
  \n    // Continue with other work on the main queue\n    for i in 0..<10 {\n        print(\"Main task \\(i)\")\n       \
  \ sleep(1)  // Simulate a long-running task\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Frida\n\nThe following Frida script can be used to **hook\
  \ into several `dispatch`** functions and extract the queue name, the backtrace and the block: [**https://github.com/seemoo-lab/frida-scripts/blob/main/scripts/libdispatch.js**](https://github.com/seemoo-lab/frida-scripts/blob/main/scripts/libdispatch.js)\n\
  \n```bash\nfrida -U <prog_name> -l libdispatch.js\n\ndispatch_sync\nCalling queue: com.apple.UIKit._UIReusePool.reuseSetAccess\n\
  Callback function: 0x19e3a6488 UIKitCore!__26-[_UIReusePool addObject:]_block_invoke\nBacktrace:\n0x19e3a6460 UIKitCore!-[_UIReusePool\
  \ addObject:]\n0x19e3a5db8 UIKitCore!-[UIGraphicsRenderer _enqueueContextForReuse:]\n0x19e3a57fc UIKitCore!+[UIGraphicsRenderer\
  \ _destroyCGContext:withRenderer:]\n[...]\n```\n\n## Ghidra\n\nCurrently Ghidra doesn't understand neither the ObjectiveC\
  \ **`dispatch_block_t`** structure, neither the **`swift_dispatch_block`** one.\n\nSo if you want it to understand them,\
  \ you could just **declare them**:\n\n<figure><img src=\"../../images/image (1160).png\" alt=\"\" width=\"563\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\
  \n<figure><img src=\"../../images/image (1162).png\" alt=\"\" width=\"563\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n<figure><img\
  \ src=\"../../images/image (1163).png\" alt=\"\" width=\"563\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\nThen, find a place\
  \ in the code where they are **used**:\n\n> [!TIP]\n> Note all of references made to \"block\" to understand how you could\
  \ figure out that the struct is being used.\n\n<figure><img src=\"../../images/image (1164).png\" alt=\"\" width=\"563\"\
  ><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\nRight click on the variable -> Retype Variable and select in this case **`swift_dispatch_block`**:\n\
  \n<figure><img src=\"../../images/image (1165).png\" alt=\"\" width=\"563\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\nGhidra\
  \ will automatically rewrite everything:\n\n<figure><img src=\"../../images/image (1166).png\" alt=\"\" width=\"563\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\
