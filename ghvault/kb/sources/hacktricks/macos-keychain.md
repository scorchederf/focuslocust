_body: "# macOS Keychain\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n## Main Keychains\n\n- The **User Keychain**\
  \ (`~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db`), which is used to store **user-specific credentials** like application passwords,\
  \ internet passwords, user-generated certificates, network passwords, and user-generated public/private keys.\n- The **System\
  \ Keychain** (`/Library/Keychains/System.keychain`), which stores **system-wide credentials** such as WiFi passwords, system\
  \ root certificates, system private keys, and system application passwords.\n  - It's possible to find other components\
  \ like certificates in `/System/Library/Keychains/*`\n- In **iOS** there is only one **Keychain** located in `/private/var/Keychains/`.\
  \ This folder also contains databases for the `TrustStore`, certificates authorities (`caissuercache`) and OSCP entries\
  \ (`ocspache`).\n  - Apps will be restricted in the keychain only to their private area based on their application identifier.\n\
  \n### Password Keychain Access\n\nThese files, while they do not have inherent protection and can be **downloaded**, are\
  \ encrypted and require the **user's plaintext password to be decrypted**. A tool like [**Chainbreaker**](https://github.com/n0fate/chainbreaker)\
  \ could be used for decryption.\n\n## Keychain Entries Protections\n\n### ACLs\n\nEach entry in the keychain is governed\
  \ by **Access Control Lists (ACLs)** which dictate who can perform various actions on the keychain entry, including:\n\n\
  - **ACLAuhtorizationExportClear**: Allows the holder to get the clear text of the secret.\n- **ACLAuhtorizationExportWrapped**:\
  \ Allows the holder to get the clear text encrypted with another provided password.\n- **ACLAuhtorizationAny**: Allows the\
  \ holder to perform any action.\n\nThe ACLs are further accompanied by a **list of trusted applications** that can perform\
  \ these actions without prompting. This could be:\n\n- **N`il`** (no authorization required, **everyone is trusted**)\n\
  - An **empty** list (**nobody** is trusted)\n- **List** of specific **applications**.\n\nAlso the entry might contain the\
  \ key **`ACLAuthorizationPartitionID`,** which is use to identify the **teamid, apple,** and **cdhash.**\n\n- If the **teamid**\
  \ is specified, then in order to **access the entry** value **withuot** a **prompt** the used application must have the\
  \ **same teamid**.\n- If the **apple** is specified, then the app needs to be **signed** by **Apple**.\n- If the **cdhash**\
  \ is indicated, then **app** must have the specific **cdhash**.\n\n### Creating a Keychain Entry\n\nWhen a **new** **entry**\
  \ is created using **`Keychain Access.app`**, the following rules apply:\n\n- All apps can encrypt.\n- **No apps** can export/decrypt\
  \ (without prompting the user).\n- All apps can see the integrity check.\n- No apps can change ACLs.\n- The **partitionID**\
  \ is set to **`apple`**.\n\nWhen an **application creates an entry in the keychain**, the rules are slightly different:\n\
  \n- All apps can encrypt.\n- Only the **creating application** (or any other apps explicitly added) can export/decrypt (without\
  \ prompting the user).\n- All apps can see the integrity check.\n- No apps can change the ACLs.\n- The **partitionID** is\
  \ set to **`teamid:[teamID here]`**.\n\n## Accessing the Keychain\n\n### `security`\n\n```bash\n# List keychains\nsecurity\
  \ list-keychains\n\n# Dump all metadata and decrypted secrets (a lot of pop-ups)\nsecurity dump-keychain -a -d\n\n# Find\
  \ generic password for the \"Slack\" account and print the secrets\nsecurity find-generic-password -a \"Slack\" -g\n\n#\
  \ Change the specified entrys PartitionID entry\nsecurity set-generic-password-parition-list -s \"test service\" -a \"test\
  \ acount\" -S\n\n# Dump specifically the user keychain\nsecurity dump-keychain ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db\n```\n\
  \n### APIs\n\n> [!TIP]\n> The **keychain enumeration and dumping** of secrets that **won't generate a prompt** can be done\
  \ with the tool [**LockSmith**](https://github.com/its-a-feature/LockSmith)\n>\n> Other API endpoints can be found in [**SecKeyChain.h**](https://opensource.apple.com/source/libsecurity_keychain/libsecurity_keychain-55017/lib/SecKeychain.h.auto.html)\
  \ source code.\n\nList and get **info** about each keychain entry using the **Security Framework** or you could also check\
  \ the Apple's open source cli tool [**security**](https://opensource.apple.com/source/Security/Security-59306.61.1/SecurityTool/macOS/security.c.auto.html)**.**\
  \ Some API examples:\n\n- The API **`SecItemCopyMatching`** gives info about each entry and there are some attributes you\
  \ can set when using it:\n  - **`kSecReturnData`**: If true, it will try to decrypt the data (set to false to avoid potential\
  \ pop-ups)\n  - **`kSecReturnRef`**: Get also reference to keychain item (set to true in case later you see you can decrypt\
  \ without pop-up)\n  - **`kSecReturnAttributes`**: Get metadata about entries\n  - **`kSecMatchLimit`**: How many results\
  \ to return\n  - **`kSecClass`**: What kind of keychain entry\n\nGet **ACLs** of each entry:\n\n- With the API **`SecAccessCopyACLList`**\
  \ you can get the **ACL for the keychain item**, and it will return a list of ACLs (like `ACLAuhtorizationExportClear` and\
  \ the others previously mentioned) where each list has:\n  - Description\n  - **Trusted Application List**. This could be:\n\
  \    - An app: /Applications/Slack.app\n    - A binary: /usr/libexec/airportd\n    - A group: group://AirPort\n\nExport\
  \ the data:\n\n- The API **`SecKeychainItemCopyContent`** gets the plaintext\n- The API **`SecItemExport`** exports the\
  \ keys and certificates but might have to set passwords to export the content encrypted\n\nAnd these are the **requirements**\
  \ to be able to **export a secret without a prompt**:\n\n- If **1+ trusted** apps listed:\n  - Need the appropriate **authorizations**\
  \ (**`Nil`**, or be **part** of the allowed list of apps in the authorization to access the secret info)\n  - Need code\
  \ signature to match **PartitionID**\n  - Need code signature to match that of one **trusted app** (or be a member of the\
  \ right KeychainAccessGroup)\n- If **all applications trusted**:\n  - Need the appropriate **authorizations**\n  - Need\
  \ code signature to match **PartitionID**\n    - If **no PartitionID**, then this isn't needed\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n> Therefore,\
  \ if there is **1 application listed**, you need to **inject code in that application**.\n>\n> If **apple** is indicated\
  \ in the **partitionID**, you could access it with **`osascript`** so anything that is trusting all applications with apple\
  \ in the partitionID. **`Python`** could also be used for this.\n\n### Two additional attributes\n\n- **Invisible**: It's\
  \ a boolean flag to **hide** the entry from the **UI** Keychain app\n- **General**: It's to store **metadata** (so it's\
  \ NOT ENCRYPTED)\n  - Microsoft was storing in plain text all the refresh tokens to access sensitive endpoint.\n\n## References\n\
