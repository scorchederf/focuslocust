  \ protocol, introduced with Windows XP, is designed for authentication via the HTTP Protocol and is **enabled by default\
  \ on Windows XP through Windows 8.0 and Windows Server 2003 to Windows Server 2012**. This default setting results in **plain-text\
  \ password storage in LSASS** (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service). An attacker can use Mimikatz to **extract these\
  \ credentials** by executing:\n\n```bash\nsekurlsa::wdigest\n```\n\nTo **toggle this feature off or on**, the _**UseLogonCredential**_\
  \ and _**Negotiate**_ registry keys within _**HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\SecurityProviders\\\
  WDigest**_ must be set to \"1\". If these keys are **absent or set to \"0\"**, WDigest is **disabled**:\n\n```bash\nreg\
  \ query HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\SecurityProviders\\WDigest /v UseLogonCredential\n```\n\n## LSA Protection\
  \ (PP & PPL protected processes)\n\n**Protected Process (PP)** and **Protected Process Light (PPL)** are **Windows kernel-level\
  \ protections** designed to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive processes like **LSASS**. Introduced in **Windows Vista**,\
  \ the **PP model** was originally created for **DRM** enforcement and only allowed binaries signed with a **special media\
  \ certificate** to be protected. A process marked as **PP** can only be accessed by other processes that are **also PP**\
  \ and have an **equal or higher protection level**, and even then, **only with limited access rights** unless specifically\
  \ allowed.\n\n**PPL**, introduced in **Windows 8.1**, is a more flexible version of PP. It allows **broader use cases**\
  \ (e.g., LSASS, Defender) by introducing **\"protection levels\"** based on the **digital signature’s EKU (Enhanced Key\
  \ Usage)** field. The protection level is stored in the `EPROCESS.Protection` field, which is a `PS_PROTECTION` structure\
  \ with:\n- **Type** (`Protected` or `ProtectedLight`)\n- **Signer** (e.g., `WinTcb`, `Lsa`, `Antimalware`, etc.)\n\nThis\
  \ structure is packed into a single byte and determines **who can access whom**:\n- **Higher signer values can access lower\
  \ ones**\n- **PPLs can’t access PPs**\n- **Unprotected processes can't access any PPL/PP**\n  \n### What you need to know\
  \ from an offensive perspective\n\n- When **LSASS runs as a PPL**, attempts to open it using `OpenProcess(PROCESS_VM_READ\
  \ | QUERY_INFORMATION)` from a normal admin context **fail with `0x5 (Access Denied)`**, even if `SeDebugPrivilege` is enabled.\n\
  - You can **check LSASS protection level** using tools like Process Hacker or programmatically by reading the `EPROCESS.Protection`\
  \ value.\n- LSASS will typically have `PsProtectedSignerLsa-Light` (`0x41`), which can be accessed **only by processes signed\
  \ with a higher-level signer**, such as `WinTcb` (`0x61` or `0x62`).\n- PPL is a **Userland-only restriction**; **kernel-level\
  \ code can fully bypass it**.\n- LSASS being PPL does **not prevent credential dumping if you can execute kernel shellcode**\
  \ or **leverage a high-privileged process with proper access**.\n- **Setting or removing PPL** requires reboot or **Secure\
  \ Boot/UEFI settings**, which can persist the PPL setting even after registry changes are reversed.\n  \n### Create a PPL\
  \ process at launch (documented API)\n\nWindows exposes a documented way to request a Protected Process Light level for\
  \ a child process during creation using the extended startup attribute list. This does not bypass signing requirements —\
  \ the target image must be signed for the requested signer class.\n\nMinimal flow in C/C++:\n\n```c\n// Request a PPL protection\
  \ level for the child process at creation time\n// Requires Windows 8.1+ and a properly signed image for the selected level\n\
  #include <windows.h>\n\nint wmain(int argc, wchar_t **argv) {\n    STARTUPINFOEXW si = {0};\n    PROCESS_INFORMATION pi\
  \ = {0};\n    si.StartupInfo.cb = sizeof(si);\n\n    SIZE_T attrSize = 0;\n    InitializeProcThreadAttributeList(NULL, 1,\
  \ 0, &attrSize);\n    si.lpAttributeList = (PPROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_LIST)HeapAlloc(GetProcessHeap(), 0, attrSize);\n    if\
  \ (!si.lpAttributeList) return 1;\n\n    if (!InitializeProcThreadAttributeList(si.lpAttributeList, 1, 0, &attrSize)) return\
  \ 1;\n\n    DWORD level = PROTECTION_LEVEL_ANTIMALWARE_LIGHT; // or WINDOWS_LIGHT/LSA_LIGHT/WINTCB_LIGHT\n    if (!UpdateProcThreadAttribute(\n\
  \            si.lpAttributeList, 0,\n            PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_PROTECTION_LEVEL,\n            &level, sizeof(level),\
  \ NULL, NULL)) {\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    DWORD flags = EXTENDED_STARTUPINFO_PRESENT;\n    if (!CreateProcessW(L\"\
  C\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\notepad.exe\", NULL, NULL, NULL, FALSE,\n                        flags, NULL, NULL, &si.StartupInfo,\
  \ &pi)) {\n        // If the image isn't signed appropriately for the requested level,\n        // CreateProcess will fail\
  \ with ERROR_INVALID_IMAGE_HASH (577).\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    // cleanup\n    DeleteProcThreadAttributeList(si.lpAttributeList);\n\
  \    HeapFree(GetProcessHeap(), 0, si.lpAttributeList);\n    CloseHandle(pi.hThread);\n    CloseHandle(pi.hProcess);\n \
  \   return 0;\n}\n```\n\nNotes and constraints:\n- Use `STARTUPINFOEX` with `InitializeProcThreadAttributeList` and `UpdateProcThreadAttribute(PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_PROTECTION_LEVEL,\
  \ ...)`, then pass `EXTENDED_STARTUPINFO_PRESENT` to `CreateProcess*`.\n- The protection `DWORD` can be set to constants\
  \ such as `PROTECTION_LEVEL_WINTCB_LIGHT`, `PROTECTION_LEVEL_WINDOWS`, `PROTECTION_LEVEL_WINDOWS_LIGHT`, `PROTECTION_LEVEL_ANTIMALWARE_LIGHT`,\
  \ or `PROTECTION_LEVEL_LSA_LIGHT`.\n- The child only starts as PPL if its image is signed for that signer class; otherwise\
  \ process creation fails, commonly with `ERROR_INVALID_IMAGE_HASH (577)` / `STATUS_INVALID_IMAGE_HASH (0xC0000428)`.\n-\
  \ This is not a bypass — it’s a supported API meant for appropriately signed images. Useful to harden tools or validate\
  \ PPL-protected configurations.\n\nExample CLI using a minimal loader:\n- Antimalware signer: `CreateProcessAsPPL.exe 3\
  \ C:\\Tools\\agent.exe --svc`\n- LSA-light signer: `CreateProcessAsPPL.exe 4 C:\\Windows\\System32\\notepad.exe`\n\n**Bypass\
  \ PPL protections options:**\n\nIf you want to dump LSASS despite PPL, you have 3 main options:\n1. **Use a signed kernel\
  \ driver (e.g., Mimikatz + mimidrv.sys)** to **remove LSASS’s protection flag**:\n\n![](../../images/mimidrv.png)\n\n2.\
  \ **Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD)** to run custom kernel code and disable the protection. Tools like **PPLKiller**,\
  \ **gdrv-loader**, or **kdmapper** make this feasible.\n3. **Steal an existing LSASS handle** from another process that\
  \ has it open (e.g., an AV process), then **duplicate it** into your process. This is the basis of the `pypykatz live lsa\
  \ --method handledup` technique.\n4. **Abuse some privileged process** that will allow you to load arbitrary code into its\
  \ address space or inside another privileged process, effectively bypassing the PPL restrictions. You can check an example\
  \ of this in [bypassing-lsa-protection-in-userland](https://blog.scrt.ch/2021/04/22/bypassing-lsa-protection-in-userland/)\
  \ or [https://github.com/itm4n/PPLdump](https://github.com/itm4n/PPLdump).\n\n**Check current status of LSA protection (PPL/PP)\
  \ for LSASS**:\n\n```bash\nreg query HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\LSA /v RunAsPPL\n```\n\nWhen\
  \ you running **`mimikatz privilege::debug sekurlsa::logonpasswords`** it'll probably fail with the error code `0x00000005`\
  \ becasue of this.\n\n- For more information about this check [https://itm4n.github.io/lsass-runasppl/](https://itm4n.github.io/lsass-runasppl/)\n\
  \n\n## Credential Guard\n\n**Credential Guard**, a feature exclusive to **Windows 10 (Enterprise and Education editions)**,\
  \ enhances the security of machine credentials using **Virtual Secure Mode (VSM)** and **Virtualization Based Security (VBS)**.\
  \ It leverages CPU virtualization extensions to isolate key processes within a protected memory space, away from the main\
  \ operating system's reach. This isolation ensures that even the kernel cannot access the memory in VSM, effectively safeguarding\
  \ credentials from attacks like **pass-the-hash**. The **Local Security Authority (LSA)** operates within this secure environment\
  \ as a trustlet, while the **LSASS** process in the main OS acts merely as a communicator with the VSM's LSA.\n\nBy default,\
  \ **Credential Guard** is not active and requires manual activation within an organization. It's critical for enhancing\
  \ security against tools like **Mimikatz**, which are hindered in their ability to extract credentials. However, vulnerabilities\
  \ can still be exploited through the addition of custom **Security Support Providers (SSP)** to capture credentials in clear\
  \ text during login attempts.\n\nTo verify **Credential Guard**'s activation status, the registry key _**LsaCfgFlags**_\
  \ under _**HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\LSA**_ can be inspected. A value of \"**1**\" indicates activation\
  \ with **UEFI lock**, \"**2**\" without lock, and \"**0**\" denotes it is not enabled. This registry check, while a strong\
  \ indicator, is not the sole step for enabling Credential Guard. Detailed guidance and a PowerShell script for enabling\
  \ this feature are available online.\n\n```bash\nreg query HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\LSA /v LsaCfgFlags\n\
  ```\n\nFor a comprehensive understanding and instructions on enabling **Credential Guard** in Windows 10 and its automatic\
  \ activation in compatible systems of **Windows 11 Enterprise and Education (version 22H2)**, visit [Microsoft's documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/credential-guard/credential-guard-manage).\n\
  \nFurther details on implementing custom SSPs for credential capture are provided in [this guide](../active-directory-methodology/custom-ssp.md).\n\
  \n## RDP RestrictedAdmin Mode\n\n**Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2** introduced several new security features, including\
  \ the _**Restricted Admin mode for RDP**_. This mode was designed to enhance security by mitigating the risks associated\
  \ with [**pass the hash**](https://blog.ahasayen.com/pass-the-hash/) attacks.\n\nTraditionally, when connecting to a remote\
  \ computer via RDP, your credentials are stored on the target machine. This poses a significant security risk, especially\
  \ when using accounts with elevated privileges. However, with the introduction of _**Restricted Admin mode**_, this risk\
  \ is substantially reduced.\n\nWhen initiating an RDP connection using the command **mstsc.exe /RestrictedAdmin**, authentication\
  \ to the remote computer is performed without storing your credentials on it. This approach ensures that, in the event of\
  \ a malware infection or if a malicious user gains access to the remote server, your credentials are not compromised, as\
  \ they are not stored on the server.\n\nIt's important to note that in **Restricted Admin mode**, attempts to access network\
  \ resources from the RDP session will not use your personal credentials; instead, the **machine's identity** is used.\n\n\
  This feature marks a significant step forward in securing remote desktop connections and protecting sensitive information\
  \ from being exposed in case of a security breach.\n\n![](../../images/RAM.png)\n\nFor more detailed information on visit\
  \ [this resource](https://blog.ahasayen.com/restricted-admin-mode-for-rdp/).\n\n## Cached Credentials\n\nWindows secures\
  \ **domain credentials** through the **Local Security Authority (LSA)**, supporting logon processes with security protocols\
  \ like **Kerberos** and **NTLM**. A key feature of Windows is its capability to cache the **last ten domain logins** to\
  \ ensure users can still access their computers even if the **domain controller is offline**—a boon for laptop users often\
  \ away from their company's network.\n\nThe number of cached logins is adjustable via a specific **registry key or group\
  \ policy**. To view or change this setting, the following command is utilized:\n\n```bash\nreg query \"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\
  SOFTWARE\\MICROSOFT\\WINDOWS NT\\CURRENTVERSION\\WINLOGON\" /v CACHEDLOGONSCOUNT\n```\n\nAccess to these cached credentials\
  \ is tightly controlled, with only the **SYSTEM** account having the necessary permissions to view them. Administrators\
  \ needing to access this information must do so with SYSTEM user privileges. The credentials are stored at: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\
  SECURITY\\Cache`\n\n**Mimikatz** can be employed to extract these cached credentials using the command `lsadump::cache`.\n\
  \nFor further details, the original [source](http://juggernaut.wikidot.com/cached-credentials) provides comprehensive information.\n\
  \n## Protected Users\n\nMembership in the **Protected Users group** introduces several security enhancements for users,\
  \ ensuring higher levels of protection against credential theft and misuse:\n\n- **Credential Delegation (CredSSP)**: Even\
  \ if the Group Policy setting for **Allow delegating default credentials** is enabled, plain text credentials of Protected\
  \ Users will not be cached.\n- **Windows Digest**: Starting from **Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2**, the system\
  \ will not cache plain text credentials of Protected Users, regardless of the Windows Digest status.\n- **NTLM**: The system\
  \ will not cache Protected Users' plain text credentials or NT one-way functions (NTOWF).\n- **Kerberos**: For Protected\
  \ Users, Kerberos authentication will not generate **DES** or **RC4 keys**, nor will it cache plain text credentials or\
  \ long-term keys beyond the initial Ticket-Granting Ticket (TGT) acquisition.\n- **Offline Sign-In**: Protected Users will\
  \ not have a cached verifier created at sign-in or unlock, meaning offline sign-in is not supported for these accounts.\n\
  \nThese protections are activated the moment a user, who is a member of the **Protected Users group**, signs into the device.\
  \ This ensures that critical security measures are in place to safeguard against various methods of credential compromise.\n\
