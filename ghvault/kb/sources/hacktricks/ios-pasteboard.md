_body: "# iOS Pasteboard\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n\nData sharing within and across applications\
  \ on iOS devices is facilitated by the [`UIPasteboard`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uipasteboard) mechanism,\
  \ which is divided into two primary categories:\n\n- **Systemwide general pasteboard**: This is used for sharing data with\
  \ **any application** and is designed to persist data across device restarts and app uninstallations, a feature that has\
  \ been available since iOS 10.\n- **Custom / Named pasteboards**: These are specifically for data sharing **within an app\
  \ or with another app** that shares the same team ID, and are not designed to persist beyond the life of the application\
  \ process that creates them, following changes introduced in iOS 10.\n\n**Security considerations** play a significant role\
  \ when utilizing pasteboards. For instance:\n\n- There is no mechanism for users to manage app permissions to access the\
  \ **pasteboard**.\n- To mitigate the risk of unauthorized background monitoring of the pasteboard, access is restricted\
  \ to when the application is in the foreground (since iOS 9).\n- The use of persistent named pasteboards is discouraged\
  \ in favor of shared containers due to privacy concerns.\n- The **Universal Clipboard** feature introduced with iOS 10,\
  \ allowing content to be shared across devices via the general pasteboard, can be managed by developers to set data expiration\
  \ and disable automatic content transfer.\n\nEnsuring that **sensitive information is not inadvertently stored** on the\
  \ global pasteboard is crucial. Additionally, applications should be designed to prevent the misuse of global pasteboard\
  \ data for unintended actions, and developers are encouraged to implement measures to prevent copying of sensitive information\
  \ to the clipboard.\n\n### Static Analysis\n\nFor static analysis, search the source code or binary for:\n\n- `generalPasteboard`\
  \ to identify usage of the **systemwide general pasteboard**.\n- `pasteboardWithName:create:` and `pasteboardWithUniqueName`\
  \ for creating **custom pasteboards**. Verify if persistence is enabled, though this is deprecated.\n\n### Dynamic Analysis\n\
  \nDynamic analysis involves hooking or tracing specific methods:\n\n- Monitor `generalPasteboard` for system-wide usage.\n\
  - Trace `pasteboardWithName:create:` and `pasteboardWithUniqueName` for custom implementations.\n- Observe deprecated `setPersistent:`\
  \ method calls to check for persistence settings.\n\nKey details to monitor include:\n\n- **Pasteboard names** and **contents**\
  \ (for instance, checking for strings, URLs, images).\n- **Number of items** and **data types** present, leveraging standard\
  \ and custom data type checks.\n- **Expiry and local-only options** by inspecting the `setItems:options:` method.\n\nAn\
  \ example of monitoring tool usage is **objection's pasteboard monitor**, which polls the generalPasteboard every 5 seconds\
  \ for changes and outputs the new data.\n\nHere's a simple JavaScript script example, inspired by the objection's approach,\
  \ to read and log changes from the pasteboard every 5 seconds:\n\n```javascript\nconst UIPasteboard = ObjC.classes.UIPasteboard\n\
  const Pasteboard = UIPasteboard.generalPasteboard()\nvar items = \"\"\nvar count = Pasteboard.changeCount().toString()\n\
  \nsetInterval(function () {\n  const currentCount = Pasteboard.changeCount().toString()\n  const currentItems = Pasteboard.items().toString()\n\
  \n  if (currentCount === count) {\n    return\n  }\n\n  items = currentItems\n  count = currentCount\n\n  console.log(\n\
  \    \"[* Pasteboard changed] count: \" +\n      count +\n      \" hasStrings: \" +\n      Pasteboard.hasStrings().toString()\
  \ +\n      \" hasURLs: \" +\n      Pasteboard.hasURLs().toString() +\n      \" hasImages: \" +\n      Pasteboard.hasImages().toString()\n\
  \  )\n  console.log(items)\n}, 1000 * 5)\n```\n\n## References\n\n- [https://mobile-security.gitbook.io/mobile-security-testing-guide/ios-testing-guide/0x06h-testing-platform-interaction#testing-object-persistence-mstg-platform-8](https://mobile-security.gitbook.io/mobile-security-testing-guide/ios-testing-guide/0x06h-testing-platform-interaction#testing-object-persistence-mstg-platform-8)\n\
