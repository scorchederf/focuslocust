_body: "# House of Roman\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n## Basic Information\n\nThis was a very interesting\
  \ technique that allowed for RCE without leaks via fake fastbins, the unsorted_bin attack and relative overwrites. However\
  \ it has been [**patched**](https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=commitdiff;h=b90ddd08f6dd688e651df9ee89ca3a69ff88cd0c).\n\
  \n### Applicability in 2026\n\n- **glibc window:** Works reliably on **2.23–2.27** (the how2heap PoC tested 2.23–2.25).\
  \ Starting **2.28**, the \"additional checks for unsorted bin integrity\" patch makes the unsorted‑bin write unreliable,\
  \ so success drops sharply. From **2.34** onward `__malloc_hook/__free_hook` were removed, making the original target unavailable.\
  \ Use it only on old libc's (or custom builds that keep the hooks) or for CTF challenges that ship an old libc.\n- **Tcache\
  \ era (≥2.26):** Tcache will eat your 0x70 allocations and stop the fastbin/unsorted primitives. Disable it (`setenv(\"\
  GLIBC_TUNABLES\",\"glibc.malloc.tcache_count=0\",1);`) **before** any allocation or fill each 0x70 tcache bin with 7 frees\
  \ to drain it.\n- **Safe-linking:** It applies to tcache/fastbin in ≥2.32, but House of Roman only needs **partial pointer\
  \ overwrite of a libc address already present in fd/bk**, so safe-linking does not help the defender here (the attacker\
  \ never forges a fresh pointer). The real stopper is the hook removal and the unsorted-bin checks.\n\n### Code\n\n- You\
  \ can find an example in [https://github.com/shellphish/how2heap/blob/master/glibc_2.23/house_of_roman.c](https://github.com/shellphish/how2heap/blob/master/glibc_2.23/house_of_roman.c)\n\
  \n### Goal\n\n- RCE by abusing relative pointers\n\n### Requirements\n\n- Edit fastbin and unsorted bin pointers\n- 12 bits\
  \ of randomness must be brute forced (0.02% chance) of working\n\n## Attack Steps\n\n### Part 1: Fastbin Chunk points to\
  \ \\_\\_malloc_hook\n\nCreate several chunks:\n\n- `fastbin_victim` (0x60, offset 0): UAF chunk later to edit the heap pointer\
  \ later to point to the LibC value.\n- `chunk2` (0x80, offset 0x70): For good alignment\n- `main_arena_use` (0x80, offset\
  \ 0x100)\n- `relative_offset_heap` (0x60, offset 0x190): relative offset on the 'main_arena_use' chunk\n\nThen `free(main_arena_use)`\
  \ which will place this chunk in the unsorted list and will get a pointer to `main_arena + 0x68` in both the `fd` and `bk`\
  \ pointers.\n\nNow it's allocated a new chunk `fake_libc_chunk(0x60)` because it'll contain the pointers to `main_arena\
  \ + 0x68` in `fd` and `bk`.\n\nThen `relative_offset_heap` and `fastbin_victim` are freed.\n\n```c\n/*\nCurrent heap layout:\n\
  \t0x0:   fastbin_victim       - size 0x70\n\t0x70:  alignment_filler     - size 0x90\n\t0x100: fake_libc_chunk      - size\
  \ 0x70 (contains a fd ptr to main_arena + 0x68)\n\t0x170: leftover_main        - size 0x20\n\t0x190: relative_offset_heap\
  \ - size 0x70\n\n\tbin layout:\n\t\tfastbin:  fastbin_victim -> relative_offset_heap\n\t\tunsorted: leftover_main\n*/\n\
  ```\n\n- `fastbin_victim` has a `fd` pointing to `relative_offset_heap`\n- `relative_offset_heap` is an offset of distance\
  \ from `fake_libc_chunk`, which contains a pointer to `main_arena + 0x68`\n- Changing the last byte of `fastbin_victim.fd`\
  \ makes `fastbin_victim` point to `main_arena + 0x68`.\n\nFor the previous actions, the attacker needs to be capable of\
  \ modifying the fd pointer of `fastbin_victim`.\n\nThen, `main_arena + 0x68` is not that interesting, so let's modify it\
  \ so the pointer points to **`__malloc_hook`**.\n\nNote that `__memalign_hook` usually starts with `0x7f` and zeros before\
  \ it, then it's possible to fake it as a value in the `0x70` fast bin. Because the last 4 bits of the address are **random**\
  \ there are `2^4=16` possibilities for the value to end pointing where we are interested. So a BF attack is performed here\
  \ so the chunk ends like: **`0x70: fastbin_victim -> fake_libc_chunk -> (__malloc_hook - 0x23)`.**\n\n(For more info about\
  \ the rest of the bytes check the explanation in the [how2heap](https://github.com/shellphish/how2heap/blob/master/glibc_2.23/house_of_roman.c)[\
  \ example](https://github.com/shellphish/how2heap/blob/master/glibc_2.23/house_of_roman.c)). If the brute force fails the\
  \ program just crashes (restart until it works).\n\nThen, 2 mallocs are performed to remove the 2 initial fast bin chunks\
  \ and a third one is allocated to get a chunk in **`__malloc_hook`**.\n\n```c\nmalloc(0x60);\nmalloc(0x60);\nuint8_t* malloc_hook_chunk\
  \ = malloc(0x60);\n```\n\n### Part 2: Unsorted_bin attack\n\nFor more info you can check:\n\n{{#ref}}\nunsorted-bin-attack.md\n\
  {{#endref}}\n\nBut basically it allows to write `main_arena + 0x68` to any location specified in `chunk->bk`. For the attack\
  \ we choose `__malloc_hook`. Then, after overwriting it we will use a relative overwrite to point to a `one_gadget`.\n\n\
  For this we start getting a chunk and putting it into the **unsorted bin**:\n\n```c\nuint8_t* unsorted_bin_ptr = malloc(0x80);\n\
  malloc(0x30); // Don't want to consolidate\n\nputs(\"Put chunk into unsorted_bin\\n\");\n// Free the chunk to create the\
  \ UAF\nfree(unsorted_bin_ptr);\n```\n\nUse an UAF in this chunk to point `unsorted_bin_ptr->bk` to the address of `__malloc_hook`\
  \ (we brute forced this previously).\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n> Note that this attack corrupts the unsorted bin (hence small and\
  \ large too). So we can only **use allocations from the fast bin now** (a more complex program might do other allocations\
  \ and crash), and to trigger this we must **alloc the same size or the program will crash.**\n\nSo, to trigger the write\
  \ of `main_arena + 0x68` in `__malloc_hook` we perform after setting `__malloc_hook` in `unsorted_bin_ptr->bk` we just need\
  \ to do: **`malloc(0x80)`**\n\n### Step 3: Set \\_\\_malloc_hook to system\n\nIn step one we controlled a chunk containing\
  \ `__malloc_hook` (in the variable `malloc_hook_chunk`) and in the second step we managed to write `main_arena + 0x68` there.\n\
  \nNow, we abuse a partial overwrite in `malloc_hook_chunk` to use the libc address we wrote there (`main_arena + 0x68`)\
  \ to **point to a `one_gadget` address**.\n\nHere is where it's needed to **bruteforce 12 bits of randomness** (more info\
  \ in the [how2heap](https://github.com/shellphish/how2heap/blob/master/glibc_2.23/house_of_roman.c)[ example](https://github.com/shellphish/how2heap/blob/master/glibc_2.23/house_of_roman.c)).\n\
  \nFinally, once the correct address is overwritten, **call `malloc` and trigger the `one_gadget`**.\n\n## Modern tips &\
  \ variants\n\n- **Unsorted-bin hardening (2.28+):** The extra integrity checks on unsorted chunks (size sanity + list linkage)\
  \ make the classic unsorted‑bin write fragile. To survive `_int_malloc`, you must keep `fd/bk` links consistent and sizes\
  \ plausible, which usually requires stronger primitives than a simple partial overwrite.\n- **Hook removal (2.34+):** With\
  \ `__malloc_hook` gone, adapt the primitive to land on any writable GOT/global you can later reuse (e.g., overwrite `exit@GOT`\
  \ in non-PIE binaries) or pivot to a **House of Pie** style top‑chunk hijack to control `top` instead of a hook.\n- **Any‑address\
  \ fastbin alloc (romanking98 writeup):** The second part shows repairing the 0x71 freelist and using the unsorted‑bin write\
  \ to land a fastbin allocation over `__free_hook`, then placing `system(\"/bin/sh\")` and triggering it via `free()` on\
  \ libc‑2.24 (pre-hook removal).\n\n## References\n\n- [https://github.com/shellphish/how2heap](https://github.com/shellphish/how2heap)\n\
