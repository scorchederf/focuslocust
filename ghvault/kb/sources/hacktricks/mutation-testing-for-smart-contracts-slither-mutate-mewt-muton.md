  \nMutation testing \"tests your tests\" by systematically introducing small changes (mutants) into contract code and re-running\
  \ the test suite. If a test fails, the mutant is killed. If the tests still pass, the mutant survives, revealing a blind\
  \ spot that line/branch coverage cannot detect.\n\nKey idea: Coverage shows code was executed; mutation testing shows whether\
  \ behavior is actually asserted.\n\n## Why coverage can deceive\n\nConsider this simple threshold check:\n\n```solidity\n\
  function verifyMinimumDeposit(uint256 deposit) public returns (bool) {\n    if (deposit >= 1 ether) {\n        return true;\n\
  \    } else {\n        return false;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nUnit tests that only check a value below and a value above the threshold\
  \ can reach 100% line/branch coverage while failing to assert the equality boundary (==). A refactor to `deposit >= 2 ether`\
  \ would still pass such tests, silently breaking protocol logic.\n\nMutation testing exposes this gap by mutating the condition\
  \ and verifying tests fail.\n\nFor smart contracts, surviving mutants frequently map to missing checks around:\n- Authorization\
  \ and role boundaries\n- Accounting/value-transfer invariants\n- Revert conditions and failure paths\n- Boundary conditions\
  \ (`==`, zero values, empty arrays, max/min values)\n\n## Mutation operators with the highest security signal\n\nUseful\
  \ mutation classes for contract auditing:\n- **High severity**: replace statements with `revert()` to expose unexecuted\
  \ paths\n- **Medium severity**: comment out lines / remove logic to reveal unverified side effects\n- **Low severity**:\
  \ subtle operator or constant swaps such as `>=` -> `>` or `+` -> `-`\n- Other common edits: assignment replacement, boolean\
  \ flips, condition negation, and type changes\n\nPractical goal: kill all meaningful mutants, and explicitly justify survivors\
  \ that are irrelevant or semantically equivalent.\n\n## Why syntax-aware mutation is better than regex\n\nOlder mutation\
  \ engines relied on regex or line-oriented rewrites. That works, but it has important limitations:\n- Multi-line statements\
  \ are hard to mutate safely\n- Language structure is not understood, so comments/tokens can be targeted badly\n- Generating\
  \ every possible variant on a weak line wastes large amounts of runtime\n\nAST- or Tree-sitter-based tooling improves this\
  \ by targeting structured nodes instead of raw lines:\n- **slither-mutate** uses Slither's Solidity AST\n- **mewt** uses\
  \ Tree-sitter as a language-agnostic core\n- **MuTON** builds on `mewt` and adds first-class support for TON languages such\
  \ as FunC, Tolk, and Tact\n\nThis makes multi-line constructs and expression-level mutations much more reliable than regex-only\
  \ approaches.\n\n## Running mutation testing with slither-mutate\n\nRequirements: Slither v0.10.2+.\n\n- List options and\
  \ mutators:\n\n```bash\nslither-mutate --help\nslither-mutate --list-mutators\n```\n\n- Foundry example (capture results\
  \ and keep a full log):\n\n```bash\nslither-mutate ./src/contracts --test-cmd=\"forge test\" &> >(tee mutation.results)\n\
  ```\n\n- If you don’t use Foundry, replace `--test-cmd` with how you run tests (e.g., `npx hardhat test`, `npm test`).\n\
  \nArtifacts are stored in `./mutation_campaign` by default. Uncaught (surviving) mutants are copied there for inspection.\n\
  \n### Understanding the output\n\nReport lines look like:\n\n```text\nINFO:Slither-Mutate:Mutating contract ContractName\n\
  INFO:Slither-Mutate:[CR] Line 123: 'original line' ==> '//original line' --> UNCAUGHT\n```\n\n- The tag in brackets is the\
  \ mutator alias (e.g., `CR` = Comment Replacement).\n- `UNCAUGHT` means tests passed under the mutated behavior → missing\
  \ assertion.\n\n## Reducing runtime: prioritize impactful mutants\n\nMutation campaigns can take hours or days. Tips to\
  \ reduce cost:\n- Scope: Start with critical contracts/directories only, then expand.\n- Prioritize mutators: If a high-priority\
  \ mutant on a line survives (for example `revert()` or comment-out), skip lower-priority variants for that line.\n- Use\
  \ two-phase campaigns: run focused/fast tests first, then re-test only uncaught mutants with the full suite.\n- Map mutation\
  \ targets to specific test commands when possible (for example auth code -> auth tests).\n- Restrict campaigns to high/medium\
  \ severity mutants when time is tight.\n- Parallelize tests if your runner allows it; cache dependencies/builds.\n- Fail-fast:\
  \ stop early when a change clearly demonstrates an assertion gap.\n\nThe runtime math is brutal: `1000 mutants x 5-minute\
  \ tests ~= 83 hours`, so campaign design matters as much as the mutator itself.\n\n## Persistent campaigns and triage at\
  \ scale\n\nOne weakness of older workflows is dumping results only to `stdout`. For long campaigns, this makes pause/resume,\
  \ filtering, and review harder.\n\n`mewt`/`MuTON` improve this by storing mutants and outcomes in SQLite-backed campaigns.\
  \ Benefits:\n- Pause and resume long runs without losing progress\n- Filter only uncaught mutants in a specific file or\
  \ mutation class\n- Export/translate results to SARIF for review tooling\n- Give AI-assisted triage smaller, filtered result\
  \ sets instead of raw terminal logs\n\nPersistent results are especially useful when mutation testing becomes part of an\
  \ audit pipeline instead of a one-off manual review.\n\n## Triage workflow for surviving mutants\n\n1) Inspect the mutated\
  \ line and behavior.\n   - Reproduce locally by applying the mutated line and running a focused test.\n\n2) Strengthen tests\
  \ to assert state, not only return values.\n   - Add equality-boundary checks (e.g., test threshold `==`).\n   - Assert\
  \ post-conditions: balances, total supply, authorization effects, and emitted events.\n\n3) Replace overly permissive mocks\
  \ with realistic behavior.\n   - Ensure mocks enforce transfers, failure paths, and event emissions that occur on-chain.\n\
  \n4) Add invariants for fuzz tests.\n   - E.g., conservation of value, non-negative balances, authorization invariants,\
  \ monotonic supply where applicable.\n\n5) Separate true positives from semantic no-ops.\n   - Example: `x > 0` -> `x !=\
  \ 0` is meaningless when `x` is unsigned.\n\n6) Re-run the campaign until survivors are killed or explicitly justified.\n\
  \n## Case study: revealing missing state assertions (Arkis protocol)\n\nA mutation campaign during an audit of the Arkis\
  \ DeFi protocol surfaced survivors like:\n\n```text\nINFO:Slither-Mutate:[CR] Line 33: 'cmdsToExecute.last().value = _cmd.value'\
  \ ==> '//cmdsToExecute.last().value = _cmd.value' --> UNCAUGHT\n```\n\nCommenting out the assignment didn’t break the tests,\
  \ proving missing post-state assertions. Root cause: code trusted a user-controlled `_cmd.value` instead of validating actual\
  \ token transfers. An attacker could desynchronize expected vs. actual transfers to drain funds. Result: high severity risk\
  \ to protocol solvency.\n\nGuidance: Treat survivors that affect value transfers, accounting, or access control as high-risk\
  \ until killed.\n\n## Do not blindly generate tests to kill every mutant\n\nMutation-driven test generation can backfire\
  \ if the current implementation is wrong. Example: mutating `priority >= 2` to `priority > 2` changes behavior, but the\
  \ right fix is not always \"write a test for `priority == 2`\". That behavior may itself be the bug.\n\nSafer workflow:\n\
  - Use surviving mutants to identify ambiguous requirements\n- Validate expected behavior from specs, protocol docs, or reviewers\n\
  - Only then encode the behavior as a test/invariant\n\nOtherwise, you risk hard-coding implementation accidents into the\
  \ test suite and gaining false confidence.\n\n## Practical checklist\n\n- Run a targeted campaign:\n  - `slither-mutate\
  \ ./src/contracts --test-cmd=\"forge test\"`\n- Prefer syntax-aware mutators (AST/Tree-sitter) over regex-only mutation\
  \ when available.\n- Triage survivors and write tests/invariants that would fail under the mutated behavior.\n- Assert balances,\
  \ supply, authorizations, and events.\n- Add boundary tests (`==`, overflows/underflows, zero-address, zero-amount, empty\
  \ arrays).\n- Replace unrealistic mocks; simulate failure modes.\n- Persist results when the tooling supports it, and filter\
  \ uncaught mutants before triage.\n- Use two-phase or per-target campaigns to keep runtime manageable.\n- Iterate until\
  \ all mutants are killed or justified with comments and rationale.\n\n## References\n\n- [Mutation testing for the agentic\
