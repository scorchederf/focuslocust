_body: "# ERC-4337 Smart Account Security Pitfalls\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\nERC-4337 account\
  \ abstraction turns wallets into programmable systems. The core flow is **validate-then-execute** across a whole bundle:\
  \ the `EntryPoint` validates every `UserOperation` before executing any of them. This ordering creates non-obvious attack\
  \ surface when validation is permissive or stateful.\n\n## 1) Direct-call bypass of privileged functions\nAny externally\
  \ callable `execute` (or fund-moving) function that is not restricted to `EntryPoint` (or a vetted executor module) can\
  \ be called directly to drain the account.\n\n```solidity\nfunction execute(address target, uint256 value, bytes calldata\
  \ data) external {\n    (bool ok,) = target.call{value: value}(data);\n    require(ok, \"exec failed\");\n}\n```\n\nSafe\
  \ pattern: restrict to `EntryPoint`, and use `msg.sender == address(this)` for admin/self-management flows (module install,\
  \ validator changes, upgrades).\n\n```solidity\naddress public immutable entryPoint;\n\nfunction execute(address target,\
  \ uint256 value, bytes calldata data) external {\n    require(msg.sender == entryPoint, \"not entryPoint\");\n    (bool\
  \ ok,) = target.call{value: value}(data);\n    require(ok, \"exec failed\");\n}\n```\n\n## 2) Unsigned or unchecked gas\
  \ fields -> fee drain\nIf signature validation only covers intent (`callData`) but not gas-related fields, a bundler or\
  \ frontrunner can inflate fees and drain ETH. The signed payload must bind at least:\n\n- `preVerificationGas`\n- `verificationGasLimit`\n\
  - `callGasLimit`\n- `maxFeePerGas`\n- `maxPriorityFeePerGas`\n\nDefensive pattern: use the `EntryPoint`-provided `userOpHash`\
  \ (which includes gas fields) and/or strictly cap each field.\n\n```solidity\nfunction validateUserOp(UserOperation calldata\
  \ op, bytes32 userOpHash, uint256)\n    external\n    returns (uint256)\n{\n    require(_isApprovedCall(userOpHash, op.signature),\
  \ \"bad sig\");\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n## 3) Stateful validation clobbering (bundle semantics)\nBecause all validations\
  \ run before any execution, storing validation results in contract state is unsafe. Another op in the same bundle can overwrite\
  \ it, causing your execution to use attacker-influenced state.\n\nAvoid writing storage in `validateUserOp`. If unavoidable,\
  \ key temporary data by `userOpHash` and delete it deterministically after use (prefer stateless validation).\n\n## 4) ERC-1271\
  \ replay across accounts/chains (missing domain separation)\n`isValidSignature(bytes32 hash, bytes sig)` must bind signatures\
  \ to **this contract** and **this chain**. Recovering over a raw hash lets signatures replay across accounts or chains.\n\
  \nUse EIP-712 typed data (domain includes `verifyingContract` and `chainId`) and return the exact ERC-1271 magic value `0x1626ba7e`\
  \ on success.\n\n## 5) Reverts do not refund after validation\nOnce `validateUserOp` succeeds, fees are committed even if\
  \ execution later reverts. Attackers can repeatedly submit ops that will fail and still collect fees from the account.\n\
  \nFor paymasters, paying from a shared pool in `validateUserOp` and charging users in `postOp` is fragile because `postOp`\
  \ can revert without undoing the payment. Secure funds during validation (per-user escrow/deposit), and keep `postOp` minimal\
  \ and non-reverting.\n\n## 6) ERC-7702 initialization frontrun\nERC-7702 lets an EOA run smart-account code for a single\
  \ tx. If initialization is externally callable, a frontrunner can set themselves as owner.\n\nMitigation: allow initialization\
  \ only on **self-call** and only once.\n\n```solidity\nfunction initialize(address newOwner) external {\n    require(msg.sender\
  \ == address(this), \"init: only self\");\n    require(owner == address(0), \"already inited\");\n    owner = newOwner;\n\
  }\n```\n\n## Quick pre-merge checks\n- Validate signatures using `EntryPoint`'s `userOpHash` (binds gas fields).\n- Restrict\
  \ privileged functions to `EntryPoint` and/or `address(this)` as appropriate.\n- Keep `validateUserOp` stateless.\n- Enforce\
  \ EIP-712 domain separation for ERC-1271 and return `0x1626ba7e` on success.\n- Keep `postOp` minimal, bounded, and non-reverting;\
  \ secure fees during validation.\n- For ERC-7702, allow init only on self-call and only once.\n\n## References\n\n- [https://blog.trailofbits.com/2026/03/11/six-mistakes-in-erc-4337-smart-accounts/](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2026/03/11/six-mistakes-in-erc-4337-smart-accounts/)\n\
