_body: "# Disable Functions Bypass - dl Function\n\n{{#include ../../../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n`dl()` lets\
  \ PHP load a shared extension at runtime. If you can make it load an attacker-controlled module, you can register a new\
  \ PHP function that internally calls `execve`, `system`, or any other native primitive and therefore bypass `disable_functions`.\n\
  \nThis is a **real** primitive, but on modern targets it is far less common than older writeups suggest.\n\n## Why this\
  \ bypass is uncommon today\n\nThe main blockers are:\n\n- `dl()` must exist and must not be disabled\n- `enable_dl` must\
  \ still allow dynamic loading\n- The target SAPI must support `dl()`\n- The payload must be a valid PHP extension compiled\
  \ for the **same target ABI**\n- The extension must be reachable from the configured `extension_dir`\n\nThe official PHP\
  \ manual is the most important reality check here: **`dl()` is only available for CLI and embed SAPIs, and for the CGI SAPI\
  \ when run from the command line**. That means the technique is **usually not available in normal PHP-FPM/mod_php web requests**,\
  \ so check the SAPI before spending time building a payload.\n\nAlso note that `enable_dl` is an `INI_SYSTEM` setting and,\
  \ as of **PHP 8.3.0**, PHP documents it as **deprecated**, so you usually cannot flip it at runtime from attacker-controlled\
  \ PHP code.\n\nIf `dl()` is not viable, go back to the broader list of [module/version dependent bypasses](README.md).\n\
  \n## Fast triage from a foothold\n\nBefore building anything, collect the exact parameters that the module must match:\n\
  \n```php\n<?php\nphpinfo();\necho \"PHP_VERSION=\" . PHP_VERSION . PHP_EOL;\necho \"PHP_SAPI=\" . php_sapi_name() . PHP_EOL;\n\
  echo \"ZTS=\" . (PHP_ZTS ? \"yes\" : \"no\") . PHP_EOL;\necho \"INT_BITS=\" . (PHP_INT_SIZE * 8) . PHP_EOL;\necho \"enable_dl=\"\
  \ . ini_get(\"enable_dl\") . PHP_EOL;\necho \"extension_dir=\" . ini_get(\"extension_dir\") . PHP_EOL;\necho \"disabled=\"\
  \ . ini_get(\"disable_functions\") . PHP_EOL;\n?>\n```\n\nWhat you care about:\n\n- `PHP_SAPI`: if this is `fpm-fcgi` or\
  \ `apache2handler`, `dl()` is usually a dead end for web exploitation\n- `extension_dir`: the payload must be loaded from\
  \ here\n- `PHP Version`, architecture, debug/non-debug, and ZTS/non-ZTS: your module must match them\n- `disable_functions`:\
  \ confirm whether `dl` is absent because it is disabled or because the SAPI does not support it\n\n## Practical exploitation\
  \ constraints\n\n### 1. You normally need write access to `extension_dir`\n\nThis is the biggest bottleneck.\n\n`dl()` takes\
  \ the **extension filename**, and PHP loads it from `extension_dir`. In practice, this means that a normal arbitrary file\
  \ upload to `/var/www/html/uploads` is not enough. You still need a path to place a `.so`/`.dll` where PHP will actually\
  \ load extensions from.\n\nRealistic situations where this becomes exploitable:\n\n- CTFs or intentionally weak labs where\
  \ `extension_dir` is writable\n- Shared-hosting or container mistakes that expose a writable extension path\n- A separate\
  \ arbitrary file write primitive that already reaches `extension_dir`\n- Post-exploitation scenarios where you already escalated\
  \ enough to drop files there\n\n### 2. The module must match the target build\n\nMatching only `PHP_VERSION` is not enough.\
  \ The extension also needs to match:\n\n- OS and CPU architecture\n- libc/toolchain expectations\n- `ZEND_MODULE_API_NO`\n\
  - debug vs non-debug build\n- ZTS vs NTS\n\nIf those do not match, `dl()` will fail or crash the process.\n\n### 3. `open_basedir`\
  \ is not the main defense here\n\nOnce you can place the module in `extension_dir` and call `dl()`, the extension code executes\
  \ inside the PHP process. At that point the relevant barrier was not `open_basedir`, but the ability to land a valid shared\
  \ object in the extension loading path.\n\n## Building the malicious extension\n\nThe classic route is still valid:\n\n\
  1. Recreate the victim build as closely as possible\n2. Use `phpize`, `./configure`, and `make` to build a shared extension\n\
  3. Export a PHP function such as `bypass_exec($cmd)` that wraps native command execution\n4. Upload the compiled module\
  \ into `extension_dir`\n5. Load it with `dl()` and call the exported function\n\nThe attack is old, but still relevant because\
  \ PHP 8.x changelogs continue to include `dl()`-specific crash fixes. The primitive still exists; the hard part is finding\
  \ a deployment where it is reachable and where you can land a matching module.\n\n## Minimal workflow\n\n### On the attacker\
  \ box\n\n```bash\nmkdir bypass && cd bypass\nphpize\n./configure\nmake\n```\n\nThe resulting shared object will usually\
  \ be under `modules/`.\n\nIf you are building on a different environment than the target, treat the produced file as a draft\
  \ until you verify that the ABI matches the victim.\n\n## Loading and using the extension\n\nIf the target really supports\
  \ `dl()` and the module is inside `extension_dir`, the runtime side is simple:\n\n```php\n<?php\nif (!extension_loaded('bypass'))\
  \ {\n    dl('bypass.so'); // use the correct filename for the target platform\n}\necho bypass_exec($_GET['cmd']);\n?>\n\
  ```\n\nOn Windows the filename will typically be a `.dll`, while on Unix-like targets it will usually be a `.so`.\n\n##\
  \ Attacker notes\n\n- Do not assume this works remotely just because `function_exists(\"dl\")` returns true in some documentation\
  \ or old writeup; validate the live SAPI\n- A failed `dl()` attempt may kill the PHP worker if the module is incompatible\n\
  - From PHP 8 onward, disabled functions are removed from the function table, so userland enumeration may differ from older\
  \ posts\n- If you cannot write to `extension_dir`, this technique is usually less practical than FPM/FastCGI, `LD_PRELOAD`,\
  \ or module-specific bypasses already covered in this section\n\n## References\n\n- [PHP manual: dl](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.dl.php)\n\
