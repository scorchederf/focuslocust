_body: "# Delivery Receipt Side-Channel Attacks in E2EE Messengers\n\n{{#include ../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\nDelivery\
  \ receipts are mandatory in modern end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) messengers because clients need to know when a ciphertext\
  \ was decrypted so they can discard ratcheting state and ephemeral keys. The server forwards opaque blobs, so device acknowledgements\
  \ (double checkmarks) are emitted by the recipient after successful decryption. Measuring the round-trip time (RTT) between\
  \ an attacker-triggered action and the corresponding delivery receipt exposes a high-resolution timing channel that leaks\
  \ device state, online presence, and can be abused for covert DoS. Multi-device \"client-fanout\" deployments amplify the\
  \ leakage because every registered device decrypts the probe and returns its own receipt.\n\n## Delivery receipt sources\
  \ vs. user-visible signals\n\nChoose message types that always emit a delivery receipt but do not surface UI artifacts on\
  \ the victim. The table below summarises the empirically confirmed behaviour:\n\n| Messenger | Action | Delivery receipt\
  \ | Victim notification | Notes |\n|-----------|--------|------------------|---------------------|-------|\n| **WhatsApp**\
  \ | Text message | ● | ● | Always noisy → only useful to bootstrap state. |\n| | Reaction | ● | ◐ (only if reacting to victim\
  \ message) | Self-reactions and removals stay silent. |\n| | Edit | ● | Platform-dependent silent push | Edit window ≈20\
  \ min; still ack’d after expiry. |\n| | Delete for everyone | ● | ○ | UI allows ~60 h, but later packets still ack’d. |\n\
  | **Signal** | Text message | ● | ● | Same limitations as WhatsApp. |\n| | Reaction | ● | ◐ | Self-reactions invisible to\
  \ victim. |\n| | Edit/Delete | ● | ○ | Server enforces ~48 h window, allows up to 10 edits, but late packets still ack’d.\
  \ |\n| **Threema** | Text message | ● | ● | Multi-device receipts are aggregated, so only one RTT per probe becomes visible.\
  \ |\n\nLegend: ● = always, ◐ = conditional, ○ = never. Platform-dependent UI behaviour is noted inline. Disable read receipts\
  \ if needed, but delivery receipts cannot be turned off in WhatsApp or Signal.\n\n## Attacker goals and models\n\n* **G1\
  \ – Device fingerprinting:** Count how many receipts arrive per probe, cluster RTTs to infer OS/client (Android vs iOS vs\
  \ desktop), and watch online/offline transitions.\n* **G2 – Behavioural monitoring:** Treat the high-frequency RTT series\
  \ (≈1 Hz is stable) as a time-series and infer screen on/off, app foreground/background, commuting vs working hours, etc.\n\
  * **G3 – Resource exhaustion:** Keep radios/CPUs of every victim device awake by sending never-ending silent probes, draining\
  \ battery/data and degrading VoIP/RTC quality.\n\nTwo threat actors are sufficient to describe the abuse surface:\n\n1.\
  \ **Creepy companion:** already shares a chat with the victim and abuses self-reactions, reaction removals, or repeated\
  \ edits/deletes tied to existing message IDs.\n2. **Spooky stranger:** registers a burner account and sends reactions referencing\
  \ message IDs that never existed in the local conversation; WhatsApp and Signal still decrypt and acknowledge them even\
  \ though the UI discards the state change, so no prior conversation is required.\n\n## Tooling for raw protocol access\n\
  \nRely on clients that expose the underlying E2EE protocol so you can craft packets outside UI constraints, specify arbitrary\
  \ `message_id`s, and log precise timestamps:\n\n* **WhatsApp:** [whatsmeow](https://github.com/tulir/whatsmeow) (Go, WhatsApp\
  \ Web protocol) or [Cobalt](https://github.com/Auties00/Cobalt) (mobile-oriented) let you emit raw `ReactionMessage`, `ProtocolMessage`\
  \ (edit/delete), and `Receipt` frames while keeping the double-ratchet state in sync.\n* **Signal:** [signal-cli](https://github.com/AsamK/signal-cli)\
  \ combined with [libsignal-service-java](https://github.com/signalapp/libsignal-service-java) exposes every message type\
  \ via CLI/API. Example self-reaction toggle:\n  ```bash\n  signal-cli -u +12025550100 sendReaction --target +12025550123\
  \ \\\n      --message-timestamp 1712345678901 --emoji \"\U0001F44D\"\n  signal-cli -u +12025550100 sendReaction --target\
  \ +12025550123 \\\n      --message-timestamp 1712345678901 --remove  # encodes empty emoji\n  ```\n* **Threema:** Source\
  \ of the Android client documents how delivery receipts are consolidated before they leave the device, explaining why the\
  \ side channel has negligible bandwidth there.\n* **Turnkey PoCs:** public projects such as `device-activity-tracker` and\
  \ `careless-whisper-python` already automate silent delete/reaction probes and RTT classification. Treat them as ready-made\
  \ reconnaissance helpers rather than protocol references; the interesting part is that they confirm the attack is operationally\
  \ simple once raw client access exists.\n\nWhen custom tooling is unavailable, you can still trigger silent actions from\
  \ WhatsApp Web or Signal Desktop and sniff the encrypted websocket/WebRTC channel, but raw APIs remove UI delays and allow\
  \ invalid operations.\n\n## Creepy companion: silent sampling loop\n\n1. Pick any historical message you authored in the\
  \ chat so the victim never sees \"reaction\" balloons change.\n2. Alternate between a visible emoji and an empty reaction\
  \ payload (encoded as `\"\"` in WhatsApp protobufs or `--remove` in signal-cli). Each transmission yields a device ack despite\
  \ no UI delta for the victim.\n3. Timestamp the send time and every delivery receipt arrival. A 1 Hz loop such as the following\
  \ gives per-device RTT traces indefinitely:\n   ```python\n   while True:\n       send_reaction(msg_id, \"\U0001F44D\")\n\
  \       log_receipts()\n       send_reaction(msg_id, \"\")  # removal\n       log_receipts()\n       time.sleep(0.5)\n \
  \  ```\n4. Because WhatsApp/Signal accept unlimited reaction updates, the attacker never needs to post new chat content\
  \ or worry about edit windows.\n\n## Spooky stranger: probing arbitrary phone numbers\n\n1. Register a fresh WhatsApp/Signal\
  \ account and fetch the public identity keys for the target number (done automatically during session setup).\n2. Craft\
  \ a reaction/edit/delete packet that references a random `message_id` never seen by either party (WhatsApp accepts arbitrary\
  \ `key.id` GUIDs; Signal uses millisecond timestamps).\n3. Send the packet even though no thread exists. The victim devices\
  \ decrypt it, fail to match the base message, discard the state change, but still acknowledge the incoming ciphertext, sending\
  \ device receipts back to the attacker.\n4. Repeat continuously to build RTT series without ever appearing in the victim’s\
  \ chat list.\n\n## Recycling edits and deletes as covert triggers\n\n* **Repeated deletes:** After a message is deleted-for-everyone\
  \ once, further delete packets referencing the same `message_id` have no UI effect but every device still decrypts and acknowledges\
  \ them.\n* **Out-of-window operations:** WhatsApp enforces ~60 h delete / ~20 min edit windows in the UI; Signal enforces\
  \ ~48 h. Crafted protocol messages outside these windows are silently ignored on the victim device yet receipts are transmitted,\
  \ so attackers can probe indefinitely long after the conversation ended.\n* **Invalid payloads:** Malformed edit bodies\
  \ or deletes referencing already purged messages elicit the same behaviour—decryption plus receipt, zero user-visible artefacts.\n\
  \n## Multi-device amplification & fingerprinting\n\n* Each associated device (phone, desktop app, browser companion) decrypts\
  \ the probe independently and returns its own ack. Counting receipts per probe reveals the exact device count.\n* If a device\
  \ is offline, its receipt is queued and emitted upon reconnection. Gaps therefore leak online/offline cycles and even commuting\
  \ schedules (e.g., desktop receipts stop during travel).\n* RTT distributions differ by platform due to OS power management\
  \ and push wakeups. Cluster RTTs (e.g., k-means on median/variance features) to label “Android handset\", “iOS handset\"\
  , “Electron desktop\", etc.\n* Because the sender must retrieve the recipient’s key inventory before encrypting, the attacker\
  \ can also watch when new devices are paired; a sudden increase in device count or new RTT cluster is a strong indicator.\n\
  \n## Behaviour inference from RTT traces\n\n1. Sample at ≥1 Hz to capture OS scheduling effects. With WhatsApp on iOS, <1\
  \ s RTTs strongly correlate with screen-on/foreground, >1 s with screen-off/background throttling.\n2. Build simple classifiers\
  \ (thresholding or two-cluster k-means) that label each RTT as \"active\" or \"idle\". Aggregate labels into streaks to\
  \ derive bedtimes, commutes, work hours, or when the desktop companion is active.\n3. Correlate simultaneous probes towards\
  \ every device to see when users switch from mobile to desktop, when companions go offline, and whether the app is rate\
  \ limited by push vs persistent socket.\n\n## Location inference from delivery RTT\n\nThe same timing primitive can be repurposed\
  \ to infer where the recipient is, not just whether they are active. The `Hope of Delivery` work showed that training on\
  \ RTT distributions for known receiver locations lets an attacker later classify the victim's location from delivery confirmations\
  \ alone:\n\n* Build a baseline for the same target while they are in several known places (home, office, campus, country\
  \ A vs country B, etc.).\n* For each location, collect many normal message RTTs and extract simple features such as median,\
  \ variance, or percentile buckets.\n* During the real attack, compare the new probe series against the trained clusters.\
  \ The paper reports that even locations within the same city can often be separated, with `>80%` accuracy in a 3-location\
  \ setting.\n* This works best when the attacker controls the sender environment and probes under similar network conditions,\
  \ because the measured path includes the recipient access network, wake-up latency, and messenger infrastructure.\n\nUnlike\
  \ the silent reaction/edit/delete attacks above, location inference does not require invalid message IDs or stealthy state-changing\
  \ packets. Plain messages with normal delivery confirmations are enough, so the tradeoff is lower stealth but wider applicability\
  \ across messengers.\n\n## Stealthy resource exhaustion\n\nBecause every silent probe must be decrypted and acknowledged,\
  \ continuously sending reaction toggles, invalid edits, or delete-for-everyone packets creates an application-layer DoS:\n\
  \n* Forces the radio/modem to transmit/receive every second → noticeable battery drain, especially on idle handsets.\n*\
  \ Generates unmetered upstream/downstream traffic that consumes mobile data plans while blending into TLS/WebSocket noise.\n\
  * Occupies crypto threads and introduces jitter in latency-sensitive features (VoIP, video calls) even though the user never\
  \ sees notifications.\n\n## References\n\n- [Careless Whisper: Exploiting Silent Delivery Receipts to Monitor Users on Mobile\
