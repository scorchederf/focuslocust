_body: "# macOS Authorizations DB & Authd\n\n{{#include ../../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n## **Athorizarions DB**\n\
  \nThe database located in `/var/db/auth.db` is database used to store permissions to perform sensitive operations. These\
  \ operations are performed completely in **user space** and are usually used by **XPC services** which need to check **if\
  \ the calling client is authorized** to perform certain action checking this database.\n\nInitially this database is created\
  \ from the content of `/System/Library/Security/authorization.plist`. Then, some services might add or modify this dataabse\
  \ to add other permissions to it.\n\nThe rules are stored in the `rules` table inside the database and contains the folliwing\
  \ colmns:\n\n- **id**: A unique identifier for each rule, automatically incremented and serving as the primary key.\n- **name**:\
  \ The unique name of the rule used to identify and reference it within the authorization system.\n- **type**: Specifies\
  \ the type of the rule, restricted to values 1 or 2 to define its authorization logic.\n- **class**: Categorizes the rule\
  \ into a specific class, ensuring it is a positive integer.\n  - \"allow\" for allow, \"deny\" for deny, \"user\" if the\
  \ group property indicated a group which membership allows the access, \"rule\" indicates in an array a rule to be fulfilled,\
  \ \"evaluate-mechanisms\" followed by a `mechanisms` array which are either builtins or a name of a bundle inside `/System/Library/CoreServices/SecurityAgentPlugins/`\
  \ or /Library/Security//SecurityAgentPlugins\n- **group**: Indicates the user group associated with the rule for group-based\
  \ authorization.\n- **kofn**: Represents the \"k-of-n\" parameter, determining how many subrules must be satisfied out of\
  \ a total number.\n- **timeout**: Defines the duration in seconds before the authorization granted by the rule expires.\n\
  - **flags**: Contains various flags that modify the behavior and characteristics of the rule.\n- **tries**: Limits the number\
  \ of allowed authorization attempts to enhance security.\n- **version**: Tracks the version of the rule for version control\
  \ and updates.\n- **created**: Records the timestamp when the rule was created for auditing purposes.\n- **modified**: Stores\
  \ the timestamp of the last modification made to the rule.\n- **hash**: Holds a hash value of the rule to ensure its integrity\
  \ and detect tampering.\n- **identifier**: Provides a unique string identifier, such as a UUID, for external references\
  \ to the rule.\n- **requirement**: Contains serialized data defining the rule's specific authorization requirements and\
  \ mechanisms.\n- **comment**: Offers a human-readable description or comment about the rule for documentation and clarity.\n\
  \n### Example\n\n```bash\n# List by name and comments\nsudo sqlite3 /var/db/auth.db \"select name, comment from rules\"\n\
  \n# Get rules for com.apple.tcc.util.admin\nsecurity authorizationdb read com.apple.tcc.util.admin\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"\
  \ encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\"\
  >\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n\t<key>class</key>\n\t<string>rule</string>\n\t<key>comment</key>\n\t<string>For modification\
  \ of TCC settings.</string>\n\t<key>created</key>\n\t<real>701369782.01043606</real>\n\t<key>modified</key>\n\t<real>701369782.01043606</real>\n\
  \t<key>rule</key>\n\t<array>\n\t\t<string>authenticate-admin-nonshared</string>\n\t</array>\n\t<key>version</key>\n\t<integer>0</integer>\n\
  </dict>\n</plist>\n```\n\nMoreover in [https://www.dssw.co.uk/reference/authorization-rights/authenticate-admin-nonshared/](https://www.dssw.co.uk/reference/authorization-rights/authenticate-admin-nonshared/)\
  \ it's possible to see the meaning of `authenticate-admin-nonshared`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"allow-root\": \"false\",\n  \"\
  authenticate-user\": \"true\",\n  \"class\": \"user\",\n  \"comment\": \"Authenticate as an administrator.\",\n  \"group\"\
  : \"admin\",\n  \"session-owner\": \"false\",\n  \"shared\": \"false\",\n  \"timeout\": \"30\",\n  \"tries\": \"10000\"\
  ,\n  \"version\": \"1\"\n}\n```\n\n## Authd\n\nIt's a deamon that will receive requests to authorize clients to perform\
  \ sensitive actions. It works as a XPC service defined inside the `XPCServices/` folder and use to write its logs in `/var/log/authd.log`.\n\
  \nMoreover using the security tool it's possible to test many `Security.framework` APIs. For example the `AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges`\
  \ running: `security execute-with-privileges /bin/ls`\n\nThat will fork and exec `/usr/libexec/security_authtrampoline /bin/ls`\
  \ as root, which will ask for permissions in a prompt to execute ls as root:\n\n<figure><img src=\"../../../images/image\
