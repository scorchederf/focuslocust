_body: "# Detecting Phishing\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n## Introduction\n\nTo detect a phishing\
  \ attempt it's important to **understand the phishing techniques that are being used nowadays**. On the parent page of this\
  \ post, you can find this information, so if you aren't aware of which techniques are being used today I recommend you to\
  \ go to the parent page and read at least that section.\n\nThis post is based on the idea that the **attackers will try\
  \ to somehow mimic or use the victim's domain name**. If your domain is called `example.com` and you are phished using a\
  \ completely different domain name for some reason like `youwonthelottery.com`, these techniques aren't going to uncover\
  \ it.\n\n## Domain name variations\n\nIt's kind of **easy** to **uncover** those **phishing** attempts that will use a **similar\
  \ domain** name inside the email.\\\nIt's enough to **generate a list of the most probable phishing names** that an attacker\
  \ may use and **check** if it's **registered** or just check if there is any **IP** using it.\n\n### Finding suspicious\
  \ domains\n\nFor this purpose, you can use any of the following tools. Note that these tools will also perform DNS requests\
  \ automatically to check if the domain has any IP assigned to it:\n\n- [**dnstwist**](https://github.com/elceef/dnstwist)\n\
  - [**urlcrazy**](https://github.com/urbanadventurer/urlcrazy)\n\nTip: If you generate a candidate list, also feed it into\
  \ your DNS resolver logs to detect **NXDOMAIN lookups from inside your org** (users trying to reach a typo before the attacker\
  \ actually registers it). Sinkhole or pre-block these domains if policy allows.\n\n### Bitflipping\n\n**You can find a short\
  \ the explanation of this technique in the parent page. Or read the original research in** [**https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hijacking-traffic-to-microsoft-s-windowscom-with-bitflipping/**](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hijacking-traffic-to-microsoft-s-windowscom-with-bitflipping/)\n\
  \nFor example, a 1 bit modification in the domain microsoft.com can transform it into _windnws.com._\\\n**Attackers may\
  \ register as many bit-flipping domains as possible related to the victim to redirect legitimate users to their infrastructure**.\n\
  \n**All possible bit-flipping domain names should be also monitored.**\n\nIf you also need to consider homoglyph/IDN lookalikes\
  \ (e.g., mixing Latin/Cyrillic characters), check:\n\n{{#ref}}\nhomograph-attacks.md\n{{#endref}}\n\n### Basic checks\n\n\
  Once you have a list of potential suspicious domain names you should **check** them (mainly the ports HTTP and HTTPS) to\
  \ **see if they are using some login form similar** to someone of the victim's domain.\\\nYou could also check port 3333\
  \ to see if it's open and running an instance of `gophish`.\\\nIt's also interesting to know **how old each discovered suspicions\
  \ domain is**, the younger it's the riskier it is.\\\nYou can also get **screenshots** of the HTTP and/or HTTPS suspicious\
  \ web page to see if it's suspicious and in that case **access it to take a deeper look**.\n\n### Advanced checks\n\nIf\
  \ you want to go one step further I would recommend you to **monitor those suspicious domains and search for more** once\
  \ in a while (every day? it only takes a few seconds/minutes). You should also **check** the open **ports** of the related\
  \ IPs and **search for instances of `gophish` or similar tools** (yes, attackers also make mistakes) and **monitor the HTTP\
  \ and HTTPS web pages of the suspicious domains and subdomains** to see if they have copied any login form from the victim's\
  \ web pages.\\\nIn order to **automate this** I would recommend having a list of login forms of the victim's domains, spider\
  \ the suspicious web pages and comparing each login form found inside the suspicious domains with each login form of the\
  \ victim's domain using something like `ssdeep`.\\\nIf you have located the login forms of the suspicious domains, you can\
  \ try to **send junk credentials** and **check if it's redirecting you to the victim's domain**.\n\n---\n\n### Hunting by\
  \ favicon and web fingerprints (Shodan/ZoomEye/Censys)\n\nMany phishing kits reuse favicons from the brand they impersonate.\
  \ Internet-wide scanners compute a MurmurHash3 of the base64-encoded favicon. You can generate the hash and pivot on it:\n\
  \nPython example (mmh3):\n\n```python\nimport base64, requests, mmh3\nurl = \"https://www.paypal.com/favicon.ico\"  # change\
  \ to your brand icon\nb64 = base64.encodebytes(requests.get(url, timeout=10).content)\nprint(mmh3.hash(b64))  # e.g., 309020573\n\
  ```\n\n- Query Shodan: `http.favicon.hash:309020573`\n- With tooling: look at community tools like favfreak to generate\
  \ hashes and dorks for Shodan/ZoomEye/Censys.\n\nNotes\n- Favicons are reused; treat matches as leads and validate content\
  \ and certs before acting.\n- Combine with domain-age and keyword heuristics for better precision.\n\n### URL telemetry\
  \ hunting (urlscan.io)\n\n`urlscan.io` stores historical screenshots, DOM, requests and TLS metadata of submitted URLs.\
  \ You can hunt for brand abuse and clones:\n\nExample queries (UI or API):\n- Find lookalikes excluding your legit domains:\
  \ `page.domain:(/.*yourbrand.*/ AND NOT yourbrand.com AND NOT www.yourbrand.com)`\n- Find sites hotlinking your assets:\
  \ `domain:yourbrand.com AND NOT page.domain:yourbrand.com`\n- Restrict to recent results: append `AND date:>now-7d`\n\n\
  API example:\n\n```bash\n# Search recent scans mentioning your brand\ncurl -s 'https://urlscan.io/api/v1/search/?q=page.domain:(/.*yourbrand.*/%20AND%20NOT%20yourbrand.com)%20AND%20date:>now-7d'\
  \ \\\n  -H 'API-Key: <YOUR_URLSCAN_KEY>' | jq '.results[].page.url'\n```\n\nFrom the JSON, pivot on:\n- `page.tlsIssuer`,\
  \ `page.tlsValidFrom`, `page.tlsAgeDays` to spot very new certs for lookalikes\n- `task.source` values like `certstream-suspicious`\
  \ to tie findings to CT monitoring\n\n### Domain age via RDAP (scriptable)\n\nRDAP returns machine-readable creation events.\
  \ Useful to flag **newly registered domains (NRDs)**.\n\n```bash\n# .com/.net RDAP (Verisign)\ncurl -s https://rdap.verisign.com/com/v1/domain/suspicious-example.com\
  \ | \\\n  jq -r '.events[] | select(.eventAction==\"registration\") | .eventDate'\n\n# Generic helper using rdap.net redirector\n\
  curl -s https://www.rdap.net/domain/suspicious-example.com | jq\n```\n\nEnrich your pipeline by tagging domains with registration\
  \ age buckets (e.g., <7 days, <30 days) and prioritise triage accordingly.\n\n### TLS/JAx fingerprints to spot AiTM infrastructure\n\
  \nModern credential-phishing increasingly uses **Adversary-in-the-Middle (AiTM)** reverse proxies (e.g., Evilginx) to steal\
  \ session tokens. You can add network-side detections:\n\n- Log TLS/HTTP fingerprints (JA3/JA4/JA4S/JA4H) at egress. Some\
  \ Evilginx builds have been observed with stable JA4 client/server values. Alert on known-bad fingerprints only as a weak\
  \ signal and always confirm with content and domain intel.\n- Proactively record TLS certificate metadata (issuer, SAN count,\
  \ wildcard use, validity) for lookalike hosts discovered via CT or urlscan and correlate with DNS age and geolocation.\n\
  \n> Note: Treat fingerprints as enrichment, not as sole blockers; frameworks evolve and may randomise or obfuscate.\n\n\
  ### Domain names using keywords\n\nThe parent page also mentions a domain name variation technique that consists of putting\
  \ the **victim's domain name inside a bigger domain** (e.g. paypal-financial.com for paypal.com).\n\n#### Certificate Transparency\n\
  \nIt's not possible to take the previous \"Brute-Force\" approach but it's actually **possible to uncover such phishing\
  \ attempts** also thanks to certificate transparency. Every time a certificate is emitted by a CA, the details are made\
  \ public. This means that by reading the certificate transparency or even monitoring it, it's **possible to find domains\
  \ that are using a keyword inside its name** For example, if an attacker generates a certificate of [https://paypal-financial.com](https://paypal-financial.com),\
  \ seeing the certificate it's possible to find the keyword \"paypal\" and know that suspicious email is being used.\n\n\
  The post [https://0xpatrik.com/phishing-domains/](https://0xpatrik.com/phishing-domains/) suggests that you can use Censys\
  \ to search for certificates affecting a specific keyword and filter by date (only \"new\" certificates) and by the CA issuer\
  \ \"Let's Encrypt\":\n\n![https://0xpatrik.com/content/images/2018/07/cert_listing.png](<../../images/image (1115).png>)\n\
  \nHowever, you can do \"the same\" using the free web [**crt.sh**](https://crt.sh). You can **search for the keyword** and\
  \ the **filter** the results **by date and CA** if you wish.\n\n![](<../../images/image (519).png>)\n\nUsing this last option\
  \ you can even use the field Matching Identities to see if any identity from the real domain matches any of the suspicious\
  \ domains (note that a suspicious domain can be a false positive).\n\n**Another alternative** is the fantastic project called\
  \ [**CertStream**](https://medium.com/cali-dog-security/introducing-certstream-3fc13bb98067). CertStream provides a real-time\
  \ stream of newly generated certificates which you can use to detect specified keywords in (near) real-time. In fact, there\
  \ is a project called [**phishing_catcher**](https://github.com/x0rz/phishing_catcher) that does just that.\n\nPractical\
  \ tip: when triaging CT hits, prioritise NRDs, untrusted/unknown registrars, privacy-proxy WHOIS, and certs with very recent\
  \ `NotBefore` times. Maintain an allowlist of your owned domains/brands to reduce noise.\n\n#### **New domains**\n\n**One\
  \ last alternative** is to gather a list of **newly registered domains** for some TLDs ([Whoxy](https://www.whoxy.com/newly-registered-domains/)\
  \ provides such service) and **check the keywords in these domains**. However, long domains usually use one or more subdomains,\
  \ therefore the keyword won't appear inside the FLD and you won't be able to find the phishing subdomain.\n\nAdditional\
  \ heuristic: treat certain **file-extension TLDs** (e.g., `.zip`, `.mov`) with extra suspicion in alerting. These are commonly\
  \ confused for filenames in lures; combine the TLD signal with brand keywords and NRD age for better precision.\n\n## References\n\
