_body: "# iOS Burp Suite Configuration\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n## Installing the Burp Certificate\
  \ on iOS Devices\n\nFor secure web traffic analysis and SSL pinning on iOS devices, the Burp Suite can be utilized either\
  \ through the **Burp Mobile Assistant** or via manual configuration. Below is a summarized guide on both methods:\n\n###\
  \ Automated Installation with Burp Mobile Assistant\n\nThe **Burp Mobile Assistant** simplifies the installation process\
  \ of the Burp Certificate, proxy configuration, and SSL Pinning. Detailed guidance can be found on [PortSwigger's official\
  \ documentation](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/tools/mobile-assistant/installing).\n\n### Manual Installation\
  \ Steps\n\n1. **Proxy Configuration:** Start by setting Burp as the proxy under the iPhone's Wi-Fi settings.\n2. **Certificate\
  \ Download:** Navigate to `http://burp` on your device's browser to download the certificate.\n3. **Certificate Installation:**\
  \ Install the downloaded profile via **Settings** > **General** > **VPN & Device Management**, then enable trust for the\
  \ PortSwigger CA under **Certificate Trust Settings**.\n\n### Configuring an Interception Proxy\n\nThe setup enables traffic\
  \ analysis between the iOS device and the internet through Burp, requiring a Wi-Fi network that supports client-to-client\
  \ traffic. If unavailable, a USB connection via usbmuxd can serve as an alternative. PortSwigger's tutorials provide in-depth\
  \ instructions on [device configuration](https://support.portswigger.net/customer/portal/articles/1841108-configuring-an-ios-device-to-work-with-burp)\
  \ and [certificate installation](https://support.portswigger.net/customer/portal/articles/1841109-installing-burp-s-ca-certificate-in-an-ios-device).\n\
  \n### Transparent Proxying via OpenVPN + `iptables` REDIRECT\n\nIf the target app ignores the configured HTTP proxy, an\
  \ alternative is to place the iOS device behind a **researcher-controlled VPN gateway** and transparently redirect the traffic\
  \ into Burp or `mitmproxy`.\n\nThis is **not a certificate pinning bypass by itself**. It only solves the network plumbing\
  \ so the device traffic reaches your interception proxy without configuring a per-app or per-device proxy. If the app performs\
  \ real certificate pinning, HTTPS decryption will still fail until pinning is bypassed separately.\n\nTypical flow:\n\n\
  1. Run an **OpenVPN** server on a Linux host and connect the iOS device so its traffic arrives on `tun0`.\n2. Bind Burp\
  \ or `mitmproxy` to the VPN listener IP on port `8080`.\n3. Enable **invisible proxying** in Burp because redirected clients\
  \ are not proxy-aware and will talk as if they were connecting directly to the destination.\n4. Redirect TCP `80` and `443`\
  \ arriving on `tun0` to the local proxy listener.\n5. Add a `POSTROUTING` **MASQUERADE** rule on the egress interface so\
  \ proxied traffic can leave the gateway and replies return through the VPN.\n6. Install and trust the interception proxy\
  \ CA on the iOS device so apps that rely only on the system trust store accept the generated leaf certificates.\n\nExample\
  \ rules:\n\n```bash\n# Redirect VPN client traffic into the local interception proxy\niptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i tun0\
  \ -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 8080\niptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i tun0 -p tcp --dport 443 -j REDIRECT --to-ports\
  \ 8080\n\n# Allow VPN client traffic to egress back to the Internet\niptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 10.8.0.0/24 -o eth0\
  \ -j MASQUERADE\n```\n\nNotes:\n\n- This is useful when you want **forced interception** without changing the target app\
  \ or configuring an explicit proxy in iOS Wi-Fi settings.\n- Redirecting `443` to Burp only works for apps that trust the\
  \ installed CA or for apps where TLS validation / pinning has already been bypassed.\n- The upstream repository example\
  \ script takes an IP and appends `/24` in the `POSTROUTING` rule. In practice, use the **actual VPN client subnet** instead\
  \ of assuming a fixed `/24`.\n- If you use Burp, enable **Proxy --> Options --> Edit listener --> Request handling --> Support\
  \ invisible proxying**.\n- `mitmproxy` can be used in the same layout if it is bound to the VPN listener IP and transparent-mode\
  \ requirements are satisfied.\n\n### Advanced Configuration for Jailbroken Devices\n\nFor users with jailbroken devices,\
  \ SSH over USB (via **iproxy**) offers a method to route traffic directly through Burp:\n\n1.  **Establish SSH Connection:**\
  \ Use iproxy to forward SSH to localhost, allowing connection from the iOS device to the computer running Burp.\n\n    ```bash\n\
  \    iproxy 2222 22\n    ```\n\n2.  **Remote Port Forwarding:** Forward the iOS device's port 8080 to the computer's localhost\
  \ to enable direct access to Burp's interface.\n\n    ```bash\n    ssh -R 8080:localhost:8080 root@localhost -p 2222\n \
  \   ```\n\n3.  **Global Proxy Setting:** Lastly, configure the iOS device's Wi-Fi settings to use a manual proxy, directing\
  \ all web traffic through Burp.\n\n### Full Network Monitoring/Sniffing\n\nMonitoring of non-HTTP device traffic can be\
  \ efficiently conducted using **Wireshark**, a tool capable of capturing all forms of data traffic. For iOS devices, real-time\
  \ traffic monitoring is facilitated through the creation of a Remote Virtual Interface, a process detailed in [this Stack\
  \ Overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9555403/capturing-mobile-phone-traffic-on-wireshark/33175819#33175819).\
  \ Prior to beginning, installation of **Wireshark** on a macOS system is a prerequisite.\n\nThe procedure involves several\
  \ key steps:\n\n1. Initiate a connection between the iOS device and the macOS host via USB.\n2. Ascertain the iOS device's\
  \ **UDID**, a necessary step for traffic monitoring. This can be done by executing a command in the macOS Terminal:\n\n\
  ```bash\n$ rvictl -s <UDID>\nStarting device <UDID> [SUCCEEDED] with interface rvi0\n```\n\n3. Post-identification of the\
  \ UDID, **Wireshark** is to be opened, and the \"rvi0\" interface selected for data capture.\n4. For targeted monitoring,\
  \ such as capturing HTTP traffic related to a specific IP address, Wireshark's Capture Filters can be employed:\n\n## Burp\
  \ Cert Installation in Simulator\n\n- **Export Burp Certificate**\n\nIn _Proxy_ --> _Options_ --> _Export CA certificate_\
  \ --> _Certificate in DER format_\n\n![](<../../images/image (534).png>)\n\n- **Drag and Drop** the certificate inside the\
  \ Emulator\n- **Inside the emulator** go to _Settings_ --> _General_ --> _Profile_ --> _PortSwigger CA_, and **verify the\
  \ certificate**\n- **Inside the emulator** go to _Settings_ --> _General_ --> _About_ --> _Certificate Trust Settings_,\
  \ and **enable PortSwigger CA**\n\n![](<../../images/image (1048).png>)\n\n**Congrats, you have successfully configured\
  \ the Burp CA Certificate in the iOS simulator**\n\n> [!TIP]\n> **The iOS simulator will use the proxy configurations of\
  \ the MacOS.**\n\n### MacOS Proxy Configuration\n\nSteps to configure Burp as proxy:\n\n- Go to _System Preferences_ -->\
  \ _Network_ --> _Advanced_\n- In _Proxies_ tab mark _Web Proxy (HTTP)_ and _Secure Web Proxy (HTTPS)_\n- In both options\
  \ configure _127.0.0.1:8080_\n\n![](<../../images/image (431).png>)\n\n- Click on _**Ok**_ and the in _**Apply**_\n\n##\
