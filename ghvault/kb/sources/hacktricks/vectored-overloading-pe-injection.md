  \ [Module Overloading](https://github.com/hasherezade/module_overloading) with **Vectored Exception Handlers (VEHs)** and\
  \ **hardware breakpoints**. Instead of patching `LoadLibrary` or writing its own loader, the adversary:\n\n1. Creates a\
  \ `SEC_IMAGE` section backed by a legitimate DLL (e.g., `wmp.dll`).\n2. Overwrites the mapped view with a fully relocated\
  \ malicious PE but keeps the section object pointing to the benign image on disk.\n3. Registers a VEH and programs debug\
  \ registers so every call to `NtOpenSection`, `NtMapViewOfSection`, and optionally `NtClose` raises a user-mode breakpoint.\n\
  4. Calls `LoadLibrary(\"amsi.dll\")` (or any other benign target). When the Windows loader invokes those syscalls, the VEH\
  \ **skips the kernel transition** and returns the handles and base addresses of the prepared malicious image.\n\nBecause\
  \ the loader still believes it mapped the requested DLL, tooling that only looks at section backing files sees `wmp.dll`\
  \ even though memory now contains the attacker’s payload. Meanwhile, imports/TLS callbacks are still resolved by the genuine\
  \ loader, significantly reducing the amount of custom PE-parsing logic the adversary must maintain.\n\n## Stage 1 – Build\
  \ the disguised section\n\n1. **Create and map a section for the decoy DLL**\n   ```c\n   NtCreateSection(&DecoySection,\
  \ SECTION_ALL_ACCESS, NULL,\n                   0, PAGE_READWRITE, SEC_IMAGE, L\"\\??\\C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\wmp.dll\"\
  );\n   NtMapViewOfSection(DecoySection, GetCurrentProcess(), &DecoyView, 0, 0,\n                      NULL, &DecoySize,\
  \ ViewShare, 0, PAGE_READWRITE);\n   ```\n2. **Copy the malicious PE into that view** section by section, honouring `SizeOfRawData`/`VirtualSize`\
  \ and updating protections afterwards (`PAGE_EXECUTE_READ`, `PAGE_READWRITE`, etc.).\n3. **Apply relocations and resolve\
  \ imports** exactly as a reflective loader would. Because the view is already mapped as `SEC_IMAGE`, section alignments\
  \ and guard pages match what the Windows loader expects later.\n4. **Normalize the PE header**:\n   - If the payload is\
  \ an EXE, set `IMAGE_FILE_HEADER.Characteristics |= IMAGE_FILE_DLL` and zero the entry point to keep `LdrpCallTlsInitializers`\
  \ from jumping into EXE-specific stubs.\n   - DLL payloads can keep their headers unchanged.\n\nAt this point the process\
  \ owns a RWX-capable view whose backing object is still `wmp.dll`, yet the bytes in memory are attacker-controlled.\n\n\
  ## Stage 2 – Hijack the loader with VEHs\n\n1. **Register a VEH and arm hardware breakpoints**: program `Dr0` (or another\
  \ debug register) with the address of `ntdll!NtOpenSection` and set `DR7` so every execution raises `STATUS_SINGLE_STEP`.\
  \ Repeat later for `NtMapViewOfSection` and optionally `NtClose`.\n2. **Trigger DLL loading** with `LoadLibrary(\"amsi.dll\"\
  )`. `LdrLoadDll` will eventually call `NtOpenSection` to obtain the real section handle.\n3. **VEH hook for `NtOpenSection`**:\n\
  \   - Locate the stack slot for the `[out] PHANDLE SectionHandle` argument.\n   - Write the previously created `DecoySection`\
  \ handle into that slot.\n   - Advance `RIP`/`EIP` to the `ret` instruction so the kernel is never called.\n   - Re-arm\
  \ the hardware breakpoint to watch `NtMapViewOfSection` next.\n4. **VEH hook for `NtMapViewOfSection`**:\n   - Overwrite\
  \ the `[out] PVOID *BaseAddress` (and size/protection outputs) with the address of the already mapped malicious view.\n\
  \   - Skip the syscall body just like before.\n5. **(Optional) VEH hook for `NtClose`** verifies that the fake section handle\
  \ is cleaned up, preventing resource leaks and providing a final sanity check.\n\nBecause the syscalls are never executed,\
  \ kernel callbacks (ETWti, minifilter, etc.) do not observe the suspicious `NtOpenSection`/`NtMapViewOfSection` events,\
  \ drastically lowering telemetry. From the loader’s point of view everything succeeded and `amsi.dll` is in memory, so it\
  \ proceeds with import/TLS resolution against the attacker’s bytes.\n\n### PoC implementation notes (2025)\n\nThe public\
  \ PoC shows a few practical details that are easy to miss when re-implementing the technique:\n\n- **HWBPs are per-thread**.\
  \ The PoC sets `CONTEXT_DEBUG_REGISTERS` on the **current thread** before calling `LoadLibrary`, so the VEH must run on\
  \ the same thread that triggers the loader.\n- **Syscall emulation**: the VEH sets `RAX = 0` and advances `RIP` to the `ret`\
  \ inside the `ntdll` stub (it scans for `0xC3`) so the kernel transition never happens, then resumes with `NtContinue`.\n\
  - **Output parameters**: for `NtMapViewOfSection`, the VEH overwrites the returned `BaseAddress`, `ViewSize`, and `Win32Protect`\
  \ outputs so the loader believes the mapping succeeded and continues with imports/TLS using the attacker’s view.\n\nMinimal\
  \ HWBP setup used by the PoC (x64):\n\n```c\nCONTEXT ctx = {0};\nctx.ContextFlags = CONTEXT_DEBUG_REGISTERS;\nGetThreadContext(GetCurrentThread(),\
  \ &ctx);\nctx.Dr0 = (DWORD64)NtOpenSection;\nctx.Dr7 = 1;\nSetThreadContext(GetCurrentThread(), &ctx);\nAddVectoredExceptionHandler(1,\
  \ VehHandler);\n```\n\n### Stealth variation\n\nRecent VEH research highlights that handlers can be registered by **manually\
  \ manipulating the VEH list** instead of calling `AddVectoredExceptionHandler`, which reduces reliance on user-mode APIs\
  \ that may be monitored or hooked. This is not required for Vectored Overloading but can be combined with it to reduce observable\
  \ API activity.\n\n## Stage 3 – Execute the payload\n\n- **EXE payload**: The injector simply jumps to the original entry\
  \ point once relocations are done. When the loader thinks it would call `DllMain`, the custom code instead executes the\
  \ EXE-style entry.\n- **DLL payload / Node.js addon**: Resolve and call the intended export (Kidkadi exposes a named function\
  \ to JavaScript). Because the module is already registered with `LdrpModuleBaseAddressIndex`, subsequent lookups see it\
  \ as the benign DLL.\n\nWhen combined with a Node.js native addon (`.node` file), all of the Windows-internals heavy lifting\
  \ stays outside the JavaScript layer, helping the threat actor ship the same loader with many different obfuscated Node\
  \ wrappers.\n\n## References\n\n- [Check Point Research – GachiLoader: Defeating Node.js Malware with API Tracing](https://research.checkpoint.com/2025/gachiloader-node-js-malware-with-api-tracing/)\n\
