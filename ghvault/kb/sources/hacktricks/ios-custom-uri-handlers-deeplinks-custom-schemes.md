  \ Basic Information\n\nCustom URL schemes enable apps to communicate using a custom protocol, as detailed in the [Apple\
  \ Developer Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/iPhone/Conceptual/iPhoneOSProgrammingGuide/Inter-AppCommunication/Inter-AppCommunication.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40007072-CH6-SW1).\
  \ These schemes must be declared by the app, which then handles incoming URLs following those schemes. It's crucial to **validate\
  \ all URL parameters** and **discard any malformed URLs** to prevent attacks through this vector.\n\nAn example is given\
  \ where the URI `myapp://hostname?data=123876123` invokes a specific application action. A noted vulnerability was in the\
  \ Skype Mobile app, which allowed unpermitted call actions via the `skype://` protocol. The registered schemes can be found\
  \ in the app's `Info.plist` under `CFBundleURLTypes`. Malicious applications can exploit this by re-registering URIs to\
  \ intercept sensitive information.\n\n### Application Query Schemes Registration\n\nFrom iOS 9.0, to check if an app is\
  \ available, `canOpenURL:` requires declaring URL schemes in the `Info.plist` under `LSApplicationQueriesSchemes`. Apps\
  \ linked on or after iOS 15 are limited to **50 entries** in this allowlist, which reduces app-enumeration abuse but is\
  \ still useful to pentesters because it exposes which third-party handlers the app expects to interact with.\n\n```xml\n\
  <key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>\n<array>\n    <string>url_scheme1</string>\n    <string>url_scheme2</string>\n</array>\n\
  ```\n\n### Testing URL Handling and Validation\n\nDevelopers should inspect specific methods in the source code to understand\
  \ URL path construction and validation, such as `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` and `application:openURL:options:`.\
  \ For modern scene-based apps, also inspect `scene:willConnectToSession:options:` and `scene:openURLContexts:` because a\
  \ lot of current iOS apps no longer route custom schemes through `UIApplicationDelegate`.\n\nFor instance, Telegram employs\
  \ various methods for opening URLs:\n\n```swift\nfunc application(_ application: UIApplication, open url: URL, sourceApplication:\
  \ String?) -> Bool {\n    self.openUrl(url: url)\n    return true\n}\n\nfunc application(_ application: UIApplication, open\
  \ url: URL, sourceApplication: String?,\nannotation: Any) -> Bool {\n    self.openUrl(url: url)\n    return true\n}\n\n\
  func application(_ app: UIApplication, open url: URL,\noptions: [UIApplicationOpenURLOptionsKey : Any] = [:]) -> Bool {\n\
  \    self.openUrl(url: url)\n    return true\n}\n\nfunc application(_ application: UIApplication, handleOpen url: URL) ->\
  \ Bool {\n    self.openUrl(url: url)\n    return true\n}\n```\n\nIf the app uses scenes, look for code such as:\n\n```swift\n\
  func scene(_ scene: UIScene,\n           willConnectTo session: UISceneSession,\n           options connectionOptions: UIScene.ConnectionOptions)\
  \ {\n    if let urlContext = connectionOptions.urlContexts.first {\n        let url = urlContext.url\n        // parse and\
  \ route the URL\n    }\n}\n\nfunc scene(_ scene: UIScene, openURLContexts URLContexts: Set<UIOpenURLContext>) {\n    guard\
  \ let url = URLContexts.first?.url else { return }\n    // parse and route the URL\n}\n```\n\n### Static Triage in Compiled\
  \ Apps\n\nWithout source code, start from `Info.plist` and then pivot into the handlers that consume the URL. Useful checks:\n\
  \n```bash\n# Extract custom schemes and canOpenURL allowlist from an IPA/app bundle\nplutil -p Payload/App.app/Info.plist\
  \ | rg 'CFBundleURLTypes|CFBundleURLSchemes|LSApplicationQueriesSchemes'\n\n# If you only have the IPA:\nunzip -p app.ipa\
  \ 'Payload/*.app/Info.plist' > /tmp/Info.plist\nplutil -p /tmp/Info.plist | rg 'CFBundleURLTypes|CFBundleURLSchemes|LSApplicationQueriesSchemes'\n\
  \n# Find relevant handlers and outbound opens in ObjC/Swift symbols/strings\nrabin2 -zzq Payload/App.app/AppBinary | rg\
  \ 'openURL|canOpenURL|openURLContexts|continueUserActivity|x-success|x-error|x-cancel'\n```\n\nInteresting findings during\
  \ static analysis:\n\n- Custom schemes carrying **reusable secrets** such as OAuth codes, magic links, password-reset tokens,\
  \ device-binding tokens, or invitation tokens.\n- Router code that maps attacker-controlled path/query values directly into\
  \ **privileged actions** such as logout, wallet transfer, KYC steps, or account linking.\n- URL parameters later reused\
  \ as **network targets**, `WKWebView` destinations, or file paths.\n- `x-success`, `x-error`, or `x-cancel` callback parameters\
  \ accepted from untrusted sources and then reopened without strict validation.\n\n### Testing URL Requests to Other Apps\n\
  \nMethods like `openURL:options:completionHandler:` are crucial for opening URLs to interact with other apps. Identifying\
  \ usage of such methods in the app's source code is key for understanding external communications.\n\n### Testing for Deprecated\
  \ Methods\n\nDeprecated methods handling URL openings, such as `application:handleOpenURL:` and `openURL:`, should be identified\
  \ and reviewed for security implications.\n\n### Triggering Custom Schemes During Dynamic Analysis\n\nCustom schemes are\
  \ easy to exercise repeatedly in the simulator:\n\n```bash\nxcrun simctl openurl booted 'myapp://debug?action=reset&token=AAAA'\n\
  ```\n\nThis is useful for quickly replaying payloads while observing logs, breakpoints, Frida hooks, or proxy traffic. On\
  \ a real device, the same payloads can be delivered from Notes, Safari, Messages, QR codes, or a helper application that\
  \ calls `UIApplication.open`.\n\nWhen instrumenting the target, hook both inbound handlers and outbound launches:\n\n- `application:openURL:options:`\n\
  - `scene:openURLContexts:`\n- `application:continueUserActivity:restorationHandler:` when the same router also handles universal\
  \ links\n- `openURL:options:completionHandler:` to see which third-party apps or callbacks the target invokes\n\n### Fuzzing\
  \ URL Schemes\n\nFuzzing URL schemes can identify parsing bugs and, in rare cases, memory-corruption bugs. Tools like [Frida](https://codeshare.frida.re/@dki/ios-url-scheme-fuzzing/)\
  \ can automate this process by opening URLs with varying payloads to monitor for crashes, exemplified by the manipulation\
  \ of URLs in the iGoat-Swift app:\n\n```bash\n$ frida -U SpringBoard -l ios-url-scheme-fuzzing.js\n[iPhone::SpringBoard]->\
  \ fuzz(\"iGoat\", \"iGoat://?contactNumber={0}&message={0}\")\nWatching for crashes from iGoat...\nNo logs were moved.\n\
  Opened URL: iGoat://?contactNumber=0&message=0\n```\n\nIf you already know which handler is used, [`furlzz`](https://github.com/NSEcho/furlzz)\
  \ is useful because it fuzzes **in-process** through multiple entry points, including `application:openURL:options:`, `scene:openURLContexts:`,\
  \ and universal-link handlers. This is practical when SpringBoard-driven delivery is too noisy and you want to focus on\
  \ the target parser itself.\n\nUseful payload classes:\n\n- Overlong path segments and query values.\n- Mixed encodings\
  \ (`%00`, double-encoded `%252f`, invalid UTF-8).\n- Duplicate keys (`id=1&id=2`) to catch inconsistent parsing between\
  \ router and business logic.\n- Unexpected callback values such as `x-success=otherapp://cb` or nested `redirect=` parameters.\n\
  \n## x-callback-url style abuse\n\nMany iOS apps implement [x-callback-url](https://x-callback-url.com/specification/) semantics\
  \ on top of custom schemes, commonly exposing `x-success`, `x-error`, and `x-cancel` parameters. From a pentest perspective,\
  \ this creates two recurring attack surfaces:\n\n- **Callback redirection / app bouncing**: If the target app accepts an\
  \ arbitrary callback URL and later re-opens it, you can chain execution into another app or into a malicious scheme you\
  \ control.\n- **Data exfiltration through callbacks**: If sensitive results are appended to `x-success` (IDs, auth artifacts,\
  \ search results, file locations, prefilled content, etc.), a rogue app can register the callback scheme and harvest them.\n\
  \nTesters should verify whether the app:\n\n- Restricts callbacks to a strict allowlist of schemes/hosts.\n- Avoids placing\
  \ secrets or bearer-like tokens in callback URLs.\n- Requires user interaction before performing destructive or externally\
  \ visible actions triggered from a URL.\n\n## Custom URL scheme hijacking\n\nApple explicitly notes that **if multiple apps\
  \ register the same scheme, the app chosen by the system is undefined**. Therefore, any security-sensitive flow that returns\
  \ data via a custom scheme must be treated as hijackable.\n\nAccording to [**this post**](https://evanconnelly.com/post/ios-oauth/),\
  \ a malicious app can **register another app's custom scheme** and then abuse [ASWebAuthenticationSession](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/authenticationservices/aswebauthenticationsession/2990952-init#parameters)\
  \ to run OAuth in a browser context that still has Safari cookies.\n\nThe attack flow is:\n\n1. The malicious app starts\
  \ an `ASWebAuthenticationSession` and sets the victim's custom scheme as the callback scheme.\n2. The session loads an attacker-controlled\
  \ page that the user is willing to open.\n3. That page redirects to the victim's OAuth authorization endpoint, often with\
  \ `prompt=none` to avoid user interaction.\n4. If the victim is already authenticated, the authorization server redirects\
  \ with an authorization code (or another secret) to the victim's custom scheme.\n5. Because the attacker's app also registered\
  \ that scheme and owns the active `ASWebAuthenticationSession`, the attacker receives the callback and can exchange the\
  \ code.\n\nThis is important because **PKCE alone does not save the flow** when the attacker originates the entire OAuth\
  \ request and chooses its own `code_challenge` / `code_verifier`. Current best practice for native apps is to prefer **claimed\
  \ `https` redirects (Universal Links)** over private-use custom schemes for auth callbacks. See also [this other page about\
  \ Universal Links](ios-universal-links.md).\n\n## References\n\n- [https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/defining-a-custom-url-scheme-for-your-app](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/defining-a-custom-url-scheme-for-your-app)\n\
