_body: "# macOS MDM\n\n{{#include ../../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n**To learn about macOS MDMs check:**\n\n- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku8jZe-MHUU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku8jZe-MHUU)\n\
  - [https://duo.com/labs/research/mdm-me-maybe](https://duo.com/labs/research/mdm-me-maybe)\n\n## Basics\n\n### **MDM (Mobile\
  \ Device Management) Overview**\n\n[Mobile Device Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_device_management) (MDM)\
  \ is utilized for overseeing various end-user devices like smartphones, laptops, and tablets. Particularly for Apple's platforms\
  \ (iOS, macOS, tvOS), it involves a set of specialized features, APIs, and practices. The operation of MDM hinges on a compatible\
  \ MDM server, which is either commercially available or open-source, and must support the [MDM Protocol](https://developer.apple.com/enterprise/documentation/MDM-Protocol-Reference.pdf).\
  \ Key points include:\n\n- Centralized control over devices.\n- Dependence on an MDM server that adheres to the MDM protocol.\n\
  - Capability of the MDM server to dispatch various commands to devices, for instance, remote data erasure or configuration\
  \ installation.\n\n### **Basics of DEP (Device Enrollment Program)**\n\nThe [Device Enrollment Program](https://www.apple.com/business/site/docs/DEP_Guide.pdf)\
  \ (DEP) offered by Apple streamlines the integration of Mobile Device Management (MDM) by facilitating zero-touch configuration\
  \ for iOS, macOS, and tvOS devices. DEP automates the enrollment process, allowing devices to be operational right out of\
  \ the box, with minimal user or administrative intervention. Essential aspects include:\n\n- Enables devices to autonomously\
  \ register with a pre-defined MDM server upon initial activation.\n- Primarily beneficial for brand-new devices, but also\
  \ applicable for devices undergoing reconfiguration.\n- Facilitates a straightforward setup, making devices ready for organizational\
  \ use swiftly.\n\n### **Security Consideration**\n\nIt's crucial to note that the ease of enrollment provided by DEP, while\
  \ beneficial, can also pose security risks. If protective measures are not adequately enforced for MDM enrollment, attackers\
  \ might exploit this streamlined process to register their device on the organization's MDM server, masquerading as a corporate\
  \ device.\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n> **Security Alert**: Simplified DEP enrollment could potentially allow unauthorized device registration\
  \ on the organization's MDM server if proper safeguards are not in place.\n\n### Basics What is SCEP (Simple Certificate\
  \ Enrolment Protocol)?\n\n- A relatively old protocol, created before TLS and HTTPS were widespread.\n- Gives clients a\
  \ standardized way of sending a **Certificate Signing Request** (CSR) for the purpose of being granted a certificate. The\
  \ client will ask the server to give him a signed certificate.\n\n### What are Configuration Profiles (aka mobileconfigs)?\n\
  \n- Apple’s official way of **setting/enforcing system configuration.**\n- File format that can contain multiple payloads.\n\
  - Based on property lists (the XML kind).\n- “can be signed and encrypted to validate their origin, ensure their integrity,\
  \ and protect their contents.” Basics — Page 70, iOS Security Guide, January 2018.\n\n## Protocols\n\n### MDM\n\n- Combination\
  \ of APNs (**Apple server**s) + RESTful API (**MDM** **vendor** servers)\n- **Communication** occurs between a **device**\
  \ and a server associated with a **device** **management** **product**\n- **Commands** delivered from the MDM to the device\
  \ in **plist-encoded dictionaries**\n- All over **HTTPS**. MDM servers can be (and are usually) pinned.\n- Apple grants\
  \ the MDM vendor an **APNs certificate** for authentication\n\n### DEP\n\n- **3 APIs**: 1 for resellers, 1 for MDM vendors,\
  \ 1 for device identity (undocumented):\n  - The so-called [DEP \"cloud service\" API](https://developer.apple.com/enterprise/documentation/MDM-Protocol-Reference.pdf).\
  \ This is used by MDM servers to associate DEP profiles with specific devices.\n  - The [DEP API used by Apple Authorized\
  \ Resellers](https://applecareconnect.apple.com/api-docs/depuat/html/WSImpManual.html) to enroll devices, check enrollment\
  \ status, and check transaction status.\n  - The undocumented private DEP API. This is used by Apple Devices to request\
  \ their DEP profile. On macOS, the `cloudconfigurationd` binary is responsible for communicating over this API.\n- More\
  \ modern and **JSON** based (vs. plist)\n- Apple grants an **OAuth token** to the MDM vendor\n\n**DEP \"cloud service\"\
  \ API**\n\n- RESTful\n- sync device records from Apple to the MDM server\n- sync “DEP profiles” to Apple from the MDM server\
  \ (delivered by Apple to the device later on)\n- A DEP “profile” contains:\n  - MDM vendor server URL\n  - Additional trusted\
  \ certificates for server URL (optional pinning)\n  - Extra settings (e.g. which screens to skip in Setup Assistant)\n\n\
  ## Serial Number\n\nApple devices manufactured after 2010 generally have **12-character alphanumeric** serial numbers, with\
  \ the **first three digits representing the manufacturing location**, the following **two** indicating the **year** and\
  \ **week** of manufacture, the next **three** digits providing a **unique** **identifier**, and the **last** **four** digits\
  \ representing the **model number**.\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nmacos-serial-number.md\n{{#endref}}\n\n## Steps for enrolment and management\n\
  \n1. Device record creation (Reseller, Apple): The record for the new device is created\n2. Device record assignment (Customer):\
  \ The device is assigned to a MDM server\n3. Device record sync (MDM vendor): MDM sync the device records and push the DEP\
  \ profiles to Apple\n4. DEP check-in (Device): Device gets his DEP profile\n5. Profile retrieval (Device)\n6. Profile installation\
  \ (Device) a. incl. MDM, SCEP and root CA payloads\n7. MDM command issuance (Device)\n\n![](<../../../images/image (694).png>)\n\
  \nThe file `/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX10.15.sdk/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/ConfigurationProfiles.framework/ConfigurationProfiles.tbd`\
  \ exports functions that can be considered **high-level \"steps\"** of the enrolment process.\n\n### Step 4: DEP check-in\
  \ - Getting the Activation Record\n\nThis part of the process occurs when a **user boots a Mac for the first time** (or\
  \ after a complete wipe)\n\n![](<../../../images/image (1044).png>)\n\nor when executing `sudo profiles show -type enrollment`\n\
  \n- Determine **whether device is DEP enabled**\n- Activation Record is the internal name for **DEP “profile”**\n- Begins\
  \ as soon as the device is connected to Internet\n- Driven by **`CPFetchActivationRecord`**\n- Implemented by **`cloudconfigurationd`**\
  \ via XPC. The **\"Setup Assistant**\" (when the device is firstly booted) or the **`profiles`** command will **contact\
  \ this daemon** to retrieve the activation record.\n  - LaunchDaemon (always runs as root)\n\nIt follows a few steps to\
  \ get the Activation Record performed by **`MCTeslaConfigurationFetcher`**. This process uses an encryption called **Absinthe**\n\
  \n1. Retrieve **certificate**\n   1. GET [https://iprofiles.apple.com/resource/certificate.cer](https://iprofiles.apple.com/resource/certificate.cer)\n\
  2. **Initialize** state from certificate (**`NACInit`**)\n   1. Uses various device-specific data (i.e. **Serial Number\
  \ via `IOKit`**)\n3. Retrieve **session key**\n   1. POST [https://iprofiles.apple.com/session](https://iprofiles.apple.com/session)\n\
  4. Establish the session (**`NACKeyEstablishment`**)\n5. Make the request\n   1. POST to [https://iprofiles.apple.com/macProfile](https://iprofiles.apple.com/macProfile)\
  \ sending the data `{ \"action\": \"RequestProfileConfiguration\", \"sn\": \"\" }`\n   2. The JSON payload is encrypted\
  \ using Absinthe (**`NACSign`**)\n   3. All requests over HTTPs, built-in root certificates are used\n\n![](<../../../images/image\
  \ (566) (1).png>)\n\nThe response is a JSON dictionary with some important data like:\n\n- **url**: URL of the MDM vendor\
  \ host for the activation profile\n- **anchor-certs**: Array of DER certificates used as trusted anchors\n\n### **Step 5:\
  \ Profile Retrieval**\n\n![](<../../../images/image (444).png>)\n\n- Request sent to **url provided in DEP profile**.\n\
  - **Anchor certificates** are used to **evaluate trust** if provided.\n  - Reminder: the **anchor_certs** property of the\
  \ DEP profile\n- **Request is a simple .plist** with device identification\n  - Examples: **UDID, OS version**.\n- CMS-signed,\
  \ DER-encoded\n- Signed using the **device identity certificate (from APNS)**\n- **Certificate chain** includes expired\
  \ **Apple iPhone Device CA**\n\n![](<../../../images/image (567) (1) (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1)\
  \ (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1)\
  \ (1) (2) (2).png>)\n\n### Step 6: Profile Installation\n\n- Once retrieved, **profile is stored on the system**\n- This\
  \ step begins automatically (if in **setup assistant**)\n- Driven by **`CPInstallActivationProfile`**\n- Implemented by\
  \ mdmclient over XPC\n  - LaunchDaemon (as root) or LaunchAgent (as user), depending on context\n- Configuration profiles\
  \ have multiple payloads to install\n- Framework has a plugin-based architecture for installing profiles\n- Each payload\
  \ type is associated with a plugin\n  - Can be XPC (in framework) or classic Cocoa (in ManagedClient.app)\n- Example:\n\
  \  - Certificate Payloads use CertificateService.xpc\n\nTypically, **activation profile** provided by an MDM vendor will\
  \ **include the following payloads**:\n\n- `com.apple.mdm`: to **enroll** the device in MDM\n- `com.apple.security.scep`:\
  \ to securely provide a **client certificate** to the device.\n- `com.apple.security.pem`: to **install trusted CA certificates**\
  \ to the device’s System Keychain.\n- Installing the MDM payload equivalent to **MDM check-in in the documentation**\n-\
  \ Payload **contains key properties**:\n- - MDM Check-In URL (**`CheckInURL`**)\n  - MDM Command Polling URL (**`ServerURL`**)\
  \ + APNs topic to trigger it\n- To install MDM payload, request is sent to **`CheckInURL`**\n- Implemented in **`mdmclient`**\n\
  - MDM payload can depend on other payloads\n- Allows **requests to be pinned to specific certificates**:\n  - Property:\
  \ **`CheckInURLPinningCertificateUUIDs`**\n  - Property: **`ServerURLPinningCertificateUUIDs`**\n  - Delivered via PEM payload\n\
  - Allows device to be attributed with an identity certificate:\n  - Property: IdentityCertificateUUID\n  - Delivered via\
  \ SCEP payload\n\n### **Step 7: Listening for MDM commands**\n\n- After MDM check-in is complete, vendor can **issue push\
  \ notifications using APNs**\n- Upon receipt, handled by **`mdmclient`**\n- To poll for MDM commands, request is sent to\
  \ ServerURL\n- Makes use of previously installed MDM payload:\n  - **`ServerURLPinningCertificateUUIDs`** for pinning request\n\
  \  - **`IdentityCertificateUUID`** for TLS client certificate\n\n## Attacks\n\n### Enrolling Devices in Other Organisations\n\
  \nAs previously commented, in order to try to enrol a device into an organization **only a Serial Number belonging to that\
  \ Organization is needed**. Once the device is enrolled, several organizations will install sensitive data on the new device:\
  \ certificates, applications, WiFi passwords, VPN configurations [and so on](https://developer.apple.com/enterprise/documentation/Configuration-Profile-Reference.pdf).\\\
  \nTherefore, this could be a dangerous entrypoint for attackers if the enrolment process isn't correctly protected:\n\n\n\
