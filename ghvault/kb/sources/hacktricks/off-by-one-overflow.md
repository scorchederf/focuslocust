_body: "# Off by one overflow\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n## Basic Information\n\nHaving just\
  \ access to a 1B overflow allows an attacker to modify the `size` field from the next chunk. This allows to tamper which\
  \ chunks are actually freed, potentially generating a chunk that contains another legit chunk. The exploitation is similar\
  \ to [double free](double-free.md) or overlapping chunks.\n\nThere are 2 types of off by one vulnerabilities:\n\n- Arbitrary\
  \ byte: This kind allows to overwrite that byte with any value\n- Null byte (off-by-null): This kind allows to overwrite\
  \ that byte only with 0x00\n  - A common example of this vulnerability can be seen in the following code where the behavior\
  \ of `strlen` and `strcpy` is inconsistent, which allows set a 0x00 byte in the beginning of the next chunk.\n  - This can\
  \ be expoited with the [House of Einherjar](house-of-einherjar.md).\n  - If using Tcache, this can be leveraged to a [double\
  \ free](double-free.md) situation.\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Off-by-null</summary>\n\n```c\n// From https://ctf-wiki.mahaloz.re/pwn/linux/glibc-heap/off_by_one/\n\
  int main(void)\n{\n    char buffer[40]=\"\";\n    void *chunk1;\n    chunk1 = malloc(24);\n    puts(\"Get Input\");\n  \
  \  gets(buffer);\n    if(strlen(buffer)==24)\n    {\n        strcpy(chunk1,buffer);\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n</details>\n\
  \nAmong other checks, now whenever a chunk is free the previous size is compared with the size configured in the metadata's\
  \ chunk, making this attack fairly complex from version 2.28.\n\n### Code example:\n\n- [https://github.com/DhavalKapil/heap-exploitation/blob/d778318b6a14edad18b20421f5a06fa1a6e6920e/assets/files/shrinking_free_chunks.c](https://github.com/DhavalKapil/heap-exploitation/blob/d778318b6a14edad18b20421f5a06fa1a6e6920e/assets/files/shrinking_free_chunks.c)\n\
  - This attack is no longer working due to the use of Tcaches.\n  - Moreover, if you try to abuse it using larger chunks\
  \ (so tcaches aren't involved), you will get the error: `malloc(): invalid next size (unsorted)`\n\n### Goal\n\n- Make a\
  \ chunk be contained inside another chunk so writing access over that second chunk allows to overwrite the contained one\n\
  \n### Requirements\n\n- Off by one overflow to modify the size metadata information\n\n### General off-by-one attack\n\n\
  - Allocate three chunks `A`, `B` and `C` (say sizes 0x20), and another one to prevent consolidation with the top-chunk.\n\
  - Free `C` (inserted into 0x20 Tcache free-list).\n- Use chunk `A` to overflow on `B`. Abuse off-by-one to modify the `size`\
  \ field of `B` from 0x21 to 0x41.\n- Now we have `B` containing the free chunk `C`\n- Free `B` and allocate a 0x40 chunk\
  \ (it will be placed here again)\n- We can modify the `fd` pointer from `C`, which is still free (Tcache poisoning)\n\n\
  ### Off-by-null attack\n\n- 3 chunks of memory (a, b, c) are reserved one after the other. Then the middle one is freed.\
  \ The first one contains an off by one overflow vulnerability and the attacker abuses it with a 0x00 (if the previous byte\
  \ was 0x10 it would make he middle chunk indicate that it’s 0x10 smaller than it really is).\n- Then, 2 more smaller chunks\
  \ are allocated in the middle freed chunk (b), however, as `b + b->size` never updates the c chunk because the pointed address\
  \ is smaller than it should.\n- Then, b1 and c gets freed. As `c - c->prev_size` still points to b (b1 now), both are consolidated\
  \ in one chunk. However, b2 is still inside in between b1 and c.\n- Finally, a new malloc is performed reclaiming this memory\
  \ area which is actually going to contain b2, allowing the owner of the new malloc to control the content of b2.\n\nThis\
  \ image explains perfectly the attack:\n\n<figure><img src=\"../../images/image (1247).png\" alt=\"\"><figcaption><p><a\

  \n### Modern glibc hardening & bypass notes (>=2.32)\n\n- Safe-Linking now protects every singly linked bin pointer by storing\
  \ `fd = ptr ^ (chunk_addr >> 12)`, so an off-by-one that only flips the low byte of `size` usually also needs a heap leak\
  \ to recompute the XOR mask before Tcache poisoning works.\n- A practical leakless trick is to \"double-protect\" a pointer:\
  \ encode a pointer you already control with `PROTECT_PTR`, then reuse the same gadget to encode your forged pointer so the\
  \ alignment check passes without revealing new addresses.\n- Workflow for safe-linking + single-byte corruptions:\n  1.\
  \ Grow the victim chunk until it fully covers a freed chunk you already control (overlapping-chunk setup).\n  2. Leak any\
  \ heap pointer (stdout, UAF, partially controlled struct) and derive the key `heap_base >> 12`.\n  3. Re-encode free-list\
  \ pointers before writing them—stage the encoded value inside user data and memcpy it later if you only own single-byte\
  \ writes.\n  4. Combine with [Tcache bin attacks](tcache-bin-attack.md) to redirect allocations into `__free_hook` or `tcache_perthread_struct`\
  \ entries once the forged pointer is properly encoded.\n\nA minimal helper to rehearse the encode/decode step while debugging\
  \ modern exploits:\n\n```python\ndef protect(ptr, chunk_addr):\n    return ptr ^ (chunk_addr >> 12)\n\ndef reveal(encoded,\
  \ chunk_addr):\n    return encoded ^ (chunk_addr >> 12)\n\nchunk = 0x55555555c2c0\nencoded_fd = protect(0xdeadbeefcaf0,\
  \ chunk)\nprint(hex(reveal(encoded_fd, chunk)))  # 0xdeadbeefcaf0\n```\n\n### Recent real-world target: glibc __vsyslog_internal\
  \ off-by-one (CVE-2023-6779)\n\n- In January 2024 Qualys detailed CVE-2023-6779, an off-by-one inside `__vsyslog_internal()`\
  \ that triggers when `syslog()/vsyslog()` format strings exceed `INT_MAX`, so the terminating `\\0` corrupts the next chunk’s\
  \ least-significant `size` byte on glibc 2.37–2.39 systems ([Qualys advisory](https://www.qualys.com/2024/01/30/cve-2023-6246/syslog.txt)).\n\
  - Their Fedora 38 exploit pipeline:\n  1. Craft an overlong `openlog()` ident so `vasprintf` returns a heap buffer next\
  \ to attacker-controlled data.\n  2. Call `syslog()` to smash the neighbor chunk’s `size | prev_inuse` byte, free it, and\
  \ force consolidation that overlaps attacker data.\n  3. Use the overlapped view to corrupt `tcache_perthread_struct` metadata\
  \ and aim the next allocation at `__free_hook`, overwriting it with `system`/a one_gadget for root.\n- To reproduce the\
  \ corrupting write in a harness, fork with a gigantic `argv[0]`, call `openlog(NULL, LOG_PID, LOG_USER)` and then `syslog(LOG_INFO,\
  \ \"%s\", payload)` where `payload = b\"A\" * 0x7fffffff`; `pwndbg`’s `heap bins` immediately shows the single-byte overwrite.\n\
  - Ubuntu tracks the bug as [CVE-2023-6779](https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2023-6779), documenting the same INT truncation\
  \ that makes this a reliable off-by-one primitive.\n\n## Other Examples & References\n\n- [**https://heap-exploitation.dhavalkapil.com/attacks/shrinking_free_chunks**](https://heap-exploitation.dhavalkapil.com/attacks/shrinking_free_chunks)\n\

  \  - Off-by-one because of `strlen` considering the next chunk's `size` field.\n  - Tcache is being used, so a general off-by-one\
  \ attacks works to get an arbitrary write primitive with Tcache poisoning.\n- [**Asis CTF 2016 b00ks**](https://ctf-wiki.mahaloz.re/pwn/linux/glibc-heap/off_by_one/#1-asis-ctf-2016-b00ks)\n\
  \  - It's possible to abuse an off by one to leak an address from the heap because the byte 0x00 of the end of a string\
  \ being overwritten by the next field.\n  - Arbitrary write is obtained by abusing the off by one write to make the pointer\
  \ point to another place were a fake struct with fake pointers will be built. Then, it's possible to follow the pointer\
  \ of this struct to obtain arbitrary write.\n  - The libc address is leaked because if the heap is extended using mmap,\
  \ the memory allocated by mmap has a fixed offset from libc.\n  - Finally the arbitrary write is abused to write into the\
  \ address of `__free_hook` with a one gadget.\n- [**plaidctf 2015 plaiddb**](https://ctf-wiki.mahaloz.re/pwn/linux/glibc-heap/off_by_one/#instance-2-plaidctf-2015-plaiddb)\n\
  \  - There is a NULL off by one vulnerability in the `getline` function that reads user input lines. This function is used\
  \ to read the \"key\" of the content and not the content.\n  - In the writeup 5 initial chunks are created:\n    - chunk1\
  \ (0x200)\n    - chunk2 (0x50)\n    - chunk5 (0x68)\n    - chunk3 (0x1f8)\n    - chunk4 (0xf0)\n    - chunk defense (0x400)\
  \ to avoid consolidating with top chunk\n  - Then chunk 1, 5 and 3 are freed, so:\n    - ```python\n      [ 0x200 Chunk\
  \ 1 (free) ] [ 0x50 Chunk 2 ] [ 0x68 Chunk 5 (free) ] [ 0x1f8 Chunk 3 (free) ] [ 0xf0 Chunk 4 ] [ 0x400 Chunk defense ]\n\
  \      ```\n  - Then abusing chunk3 (0x1f8) the null off-by-one is abused writing the prev_size to `0x4e0`.\n    - Note\
  \ how the sizes of the initially allocated chunks1, 2, 5 and 3 plus the headers of 4 of those chunks equals to `0x4e0`:\
  \ `hex(0x1f8 + 0x10 + 0x68 + 0x10 + 0x50 + 0x10 + 0x200) = 0x4e0`\n  - Then, chunk 4 is freed, generating a chunk that consumes\
  \ all the chunks till the beginning:\n    - ```python\n      [ 0x4e0 Chunk 1-2-5-3 (free) ] [ 0xf0 Chunk 4 (corrupted) ]\
  \ [ 0x400 Chunk defense ]\n      ```\n    - ```python\n      [ 0x200 Chunk 1 (free) ] [ 0x50 Chunk 2 ] [ 0x68 Chunk 5 (free)\
  \ ] [ 0x1f8 Chunk 3 (free) ] [ 0xf0 Chunk 4 ] [ 0x400 Chunk defense ]\n      ```\n  - Then, `0x200` bytes are allocated\
  \ filling the original chunk 1\n    - And another 0x200 bytes are allocated and chunk2 is destroyed and therefore there\
  \ isn't no fucking leak and this doesn't work? Maybe this shouldn't be done\n  - Then, it allocates another chunk with 0x58\
  \ \"a\"s (overwriting chunk2 and reaching chunk5) and modifies the `fd` of the fast bin chunk of chunk5 pointing it to `__malloc_hook`\n\
  \  - Then, a chunk of 0x68 is allocated so the fake fast bin chunk in `__malloc_hook` is the following fast bin chunk\n\
  \  - Finally, a new fast bin chunk of 0x68 is allocated and `__malloc_hook` is overwritten with a `one_gadget` address\n\
