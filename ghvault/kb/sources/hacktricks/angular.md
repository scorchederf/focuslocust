  \n* [ ] Angular is considered a client-side framework and is not expected to provide server-side protection\n* [ ] Sourcemap\
  \ for scripts is disabled in the project configuration\n* [ ] Untrusted user input is always interpolated or sanitized before\
  \ being used in templates\n* [ ] The user has no control over server-side or client-side templates\n* [ ] Untrusted user\
  \ input is sanitized using an appropriate security context before being trusted by the application\n  * [ ] `BypassSecurity*`\
  \ methods are not used with untrusted input\n* [ ] Untrusted user input is not passed to Angular classes such as `ElementRef`\
  \ , `Renderer2` and `Document`, or other JQuery/DOM sinks\n\n## What is Angular\n\nAngular is a **powerful** and **open-source**\
  \ front-end framework maintained by **Google**. It uses **TypeScript** to enhance code readability and debugging. With strong\
  \ security mechanisms, Angular prevents common client-side vulnerabilities like **XSS** and **open redirects**. It can be\
  \ used on the **server-side** too, making security considerations important from **both angles**.\n\n## Framework architecture\n\
  \nIn order to better understand the Angular basics, let’s go through its essential concepts.\n\nCommon Angular project usually\
  \ looks like:\n\n```bash\nmy-workspace/\n├── ... #workspace-wide configuration files\n├── src\n│   ├── app\n│   │   ├──\
  \ app.module.ts #defines the root module, that tells Angular how to assemble the application\n│   │   ├── app.component.ts\
  \ #defines the logic for the application's root component\n│   │   ├── app.component.html #defines the HTML template associated\
  \ with the root component\n│   │   ├── app.component.css #defines the base CSS stylesheet for the root component\n│   │\
  \   ├── app.component.spec.ts #defines a unit test for the root component\n│   │   └── app-routing.module.ts #provides routing\
  \ capability for the application\n│   ├── lib\n│   │   └── src #library-specific configuration files\n│   ├── index.html\
  \ #main HTML page, where the component will be rendered in\n│   └── ... #application-specific configuration files\n├── angular.json\
  \ #provides workspace-wide and project-specific configuration defaults\n└── tsconfig.json #provides the base TypeScript\
  \ configuration for projects in the workspace\n```\n\nAccording to the documentation, every Angular application has at least\
  \ one component, the root component (`AppComponent`) that connects a component hierarchy with the DOM. Each component defines\
  \ a class that contains application data and logic, and is associated with an HTML template that defines a view to be displayed\
  \ in a target environment. The `@Component()` decorator identifies the class immediately below it as a component, and provides\
  \ the template and related component-specific metadata. The `AppComponent` is defined in the `app.component.ts` file.\n\n\
  Angular NgModules declare a compilation context for a set of components that is dedicated to an application domain, a workflow,\
  \ or a closely related set of capabilities. Every Angular application has a root module, conventionally named `AppModule`,\
  \ which provides the bootstrap mechanism that launches the application. An application typically contains many functional\
  \ modules. The `AppModule` is defined in the `app.module.ts` file.\n\nThe Angular `Router` NgModule provides a service that\
  \ lets you define a navigation path among the different application states and view hierarchies in your application. The\
  \ `RouterModule`is defined in the `app-routing.module.ts` file.\n\nFor data or logic that isn't associated with a specific\
  \ view, and that you want to share across components, you create a service class. A service class definition is immediately\
  \ preceded by the `@Injectable()` decorator. The decorator provides the metadata that allows other providers to be injected\
  \ as dependencies into your class. Dependency injection (DI) lets you keep your component classes lean and efficient. They\
  \ don't fetch data from the server, validate user input, or log directly to the console; they delegate such tasks to services.\n\
  \n## Sourcemap configuration\n\nAngular framework translates TypeScript files into JavaScript code by following `tsconfig.json`\
  \ options and then builds a project with `angular.json` configuration. Looking at `angular.json` file, we observed an option\
  \ to enable or disable a sourcemap. According to the Angular documentation, the default configuration has a sourcemap file\
  \ enabled for scripts and is not hidden by default:\n\n```json\n\"sourceMap\": {\n\t\"scripts\": true,\n\t\"styles\": true,\n\
  \t\"vendor\": false,\n\t\"hidden\": false\n}\n```\n\nGenerally, sourcemap files are utilized for debugging purposes as they\
  \ map generated files to their original files. Therefore, it is not recommended to use them in a production environment.\
  \ If sourcemaps are enabled, it improves the readability and aids in file analysis by replicating the original state of\
  \ the Angular project. However, if they are disabled, a reviewer can still analyze a compiled JavaScript file manually by\
  \ searching for anti-security patterns.\n\nFurthemore, a compiled JavaScript file with an Angular project can be found in\
  \ the browser developer tools → Sources (or Debugger and Sources) → \\[id].main.js. Depending on the enabled options, this\
  \ file may contain the following row in the end `//# sourceMappingURL=[id].main.js.map` or it may not, if the **hidden**\
  \ option is set to **true**. Nonetheless, if the sourcemap is disabled for **scripts**, testing becomes more complex, and\
  \ we cannot obtain the file. In addition, sourcemap can be enabled during project build like `ng build --source-map`.\n\n\
  ## Data binding\n\nBinding refers to the process of communication between a component and its corresponding view. It is\
  \ utilized for transferring data to and from the Angular framework. Data can be passed through various means, such as through\
  \ events, interpolation, properties, or through the two-way binding mechanism. Moreover, data can also be shared between\
  \ related components (parent-child relation) and between two unrelated components using the Service feature.\n\nWe can classify\
  \ binding by data flow:\n\n* Data source to view target (includes _interpolation_, _properties_, _attributes_, _classes_\
  \ and _styles_); can be applied by using `[]` or `{{}}` in template;\n* View target to data source (includes _events_);\
  \ can be applied by using `()` in template;\n* Two-Way; can be applied by using `[()]` in template.\n\nBinding can be called\
  \ on properties, events, and attributes, as well as on any public member of a source directive:\n\n| TYPE      | TARGET\
  \                                                   | EXAMPLES                                                         \
  \    |\n| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------\
  \ |\n| Property  | Element property, Component property, Directive property | \\<img \\[alt]=\"hero.name\" \\[src]=\"heroImageUrl\"\
  >                      |\n| Event     | Element event, Component event, Directive event          | \\<button type=\"button\"\
  \ (click)=\"onSave()\">Save                       |\n| Two-way   | Event and property                                  \
  \     | \\<input \\[(ngModel)]=\"name\">                                         |\n| Attribute | Attribute (the exception)\
  \                                | \\<button type=\"button\" \\[attr.aria-label]=\"help\">help                |\n| Class\
  \     | class property                                           | \\<div \\[class.special]=\"isSpecial\">Special      \
  \                     |\n| Style     | style property                                           | \\<button type=\"button\"\
  \ \\[style.color]=\"isSpecial ? 'red' : 'green'\"> |\n\n## Angular security model\n\nAngular's design includes encoding\
  \ or sanitization of all data by default, making it increasingly difficult to discover and exploit XSS vulnerabilities in\
  \ Angular projects. There are two distinct scenarios for data handling:\n\n1.  Interpolation or `{{user_input}}`- performs\
  \ context-sensitive encoding and interprets user input as text;\n\n    ```jsx\n    //app.component.ts\n    test = \"<script>alert(1)</script><h1>test</h1>\"\
  ;\n\n    //app.component.html\n    {{test}}\n    ```\n\n    Result: `&lt;script&gt;alert(1)&lt;/script&gt;&lt;h1&gt;test&lt;/h1&gt;`\n\
  2.  Binding to properties, attributes, classes and styles or `[attribute]=\"user_input\"` - performs sanitization based\
  \ on the provided security context.\n\n    ```jsx\n    //app.component.ts\n    test = \"<script>alert(1)</script><h1>test</h1>\"\
  ;\n\n    //app.component.html\n    <div [innerHtml]=\"test\"></div>\n    ```\n\n    Result: `<div><h1>test</h1></div>`\n\
  \nThere are 6 types of `SecurityContext` :\n\n* `None`;\n* `HTML` is used, when interpreting value as HTML;\n* `STYLE` is\
  \ used, when binding CSS into the `style` property;\n* `URL` is used for URL properties, such as `<a href>`;\n* `SCRIPT`\
  \ is used for JavaScript code;\n* `RESOURCE_URL` as a URL that is loaded and executed as code, for example, in `<script\
  \ src>`.\n\n## Vulnerabilities\n\n### Bypass Security Trust methods\n\nThe Angular introduces a list of methods to bypass\
  \ its default sanitization process and to indicate that a value can be used safely in a specific context, as in the following\
  \ five examples:\n\n1.  `bypassSecurityTrustUrl` is used to indicate the given value is a safe style URL:\n\n    ```jsx\n\
  \    //app.component.ts\n    this.trustedUrl = this.sanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustUrl('javascript:alert()');\n\n    //app.component.html\n\
  \    <a class=\"e2e-trusted-url\" [href]=\"trustedUrl\">Click me</a>\n\n    //result\n    <a _ngcontent-pqg-c12=\"\" class=\"\
  e2e-trusted-url\" href=\"javascript:alert()\">Click me</a>\n    ```\n2.  `bypassSecurityTrustResourceUrl` is used to indicate\
  \ the given value is a safe resource URL:\n\n    ```jsx\n    //app.component.ts\n    this.trustedResourceUrl = this.sanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustResourceUrl(\"\
  https://www.google.com/images/branding/googlelogo/1x/googlelogo_light_color_272x92dp.png\");\n\n    //app.component.html\n\
  \    <iframe [src]=\"trustedResourceUrl\"></iframe>\n\n    //result\n    <img _ngcontent-nre-c12=\"\" src=\"https://www.google.com/images/branding/googlelogo/1x/googlelogo_light_color_272x92dp.png\"\
  >\n    ```\n3.  `bypassSecurityTrustHtml` is used to indicate the given value is safe HTML. Note that inserting `script`\
  \ elements into the DOM tree in this way will not cause them to execute the enclosed JavaScript code, because of how these\
  \ elements are added to the DOM tree.\n\n    ```jsx\n    //app.component.ts\n    this.trustedHtml = this.sanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustHtml(\"\
  <h1>html tag</h1><svg onclick=\\\"alert('bypassSecurityTrustHtml')\\\" style=display:block>blah</svg>\");\n\n    //app.component.html\n\
  \    <p style=\"border:solid\" [innerHtml]=\"trustedHtml\"></p>\n\n    //result\n    <h1>html tag</h1>\n    <svg onclick=\"\
  alert('bypassSecurityTrustHtml')\" style=\"display:block\">blah</svg>\n    ```\n4.  `bypassSecurityTrustScript` is used\
  \ to indicate the given value is safe JavaScript. However, we found its behavior to be unpredictable, because we couldn’t\
  \ to execute JS code in templates using this method.\n\n    ```jsx\n    //app.component.ts\n    this.trustedScript = this.sanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustScript(\"\
  alert('bypass Security TrustScript')\");\n\n    //app.component.html\n    <script [innerHtml]=\"trustedScript\"></script>\n\
  \n    //result\n    -\n    ```\n5.  `bypassSecurityTrustStyle` is used to indicate the given value is safe CSS. The following\
  \ example illustrates CSS injection:\n\n    ```jsx\n    //app.component.ts\n    this.trustedStyle = this.sanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustStyle('background-image:\
  \ url(https://example.com/exfil/a)');\n\n    //app.component.html\n    <input type=\"password\" name=\"pwd\" value=\"01234\"\
  \ [style]=\"trustedStyle\">\n\n    //result\n    Request URL: GET example.com/exfil/a\n    ```\n\nAngular provides a `sanitize`\
  \ method to sanitize data before displaying it in views. This method employs the security context provided and cleanses\
  \ the input accordingly. It is, however, crucial to use the correct security context for the specific data and context.\
  \ For instance, applying a sanitizer with `SecurityContext.URL` on HTML content does not provide protection against dangerous\
  \ HTML values. In such scenarios, misuse of security context could lead to XSS vulnerabilities.\n\n### HTML injection\n\n\
  This vulnerability occurs when user input is bound to any of the three properties: `innerHTML`, `outerHTML`, or `iframe`\
  \ `srcdoc`. While binding to these attributes interprets HTML as it is, the input is sanitized using `SecurityContext.HTML`.\
  \ Thus, HTML injection is possible, but cross-site scripting (XSS) is not.\n\nExample of using `innerHTML`:\n\n```jsx\n\
  //app.component.ts\nimport { Component} from '@angular/core';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  templateUrl: './app.component.html'\n\
  })\nexport class AppComponent{\n\t//define a variable with user input\n  test = \"<script>alert(1)</script><h1>test</h1>\"\
  ;\n}\n\n//app.component.html\n<div [innerHTML]=\"test\"></div>\n```\n\nThe result is `<div><h1>test</h1></div>`.\n\n###\
  \ Template injection\n\n#### Client-Side Rendering (CSR)\n\nAngular leverages templates to construct pages dynamically.\
  \ The approach entails enclosing template expressions for Angular to evaluate within double curly brackets (`{{}}`). In\
  \ this way, the framework offers additional functionality. For instance, a template such as `{{1+1}}` would display as 2.\n\
  \nTypically, Angular escapes user input that can be confused with template expressions (e.g., characters such as \\`< >\
  \ ' \" \\`\\`). It means that additional steps are required to circumvent this restriction, such as utilizing functions\
  \ that generate JavaScript string objects to avoid using blacklisted characters. However, to achieve this, we must consider\
  \ the Angular context, its properties, and variables. Therefore, a template injection attack may appear as follows:\n\n\
  ```jsx\n//app.component.ts\nconst _userInput = '{{constructor.constructor(\\'alert(1)\\'()}}'\n@Component({\n\tselector:\
  \ 'app-root',\n\ttemplate: '<h1>title</h1>' + _userInput\n})\n```\n\nAs shown above: `constructor`refers to the scope of\
  \ the Object `constructor` property, enabling us to invoke the String constructor and execute an arbitrary code.\n\n####\
  \ Server-Side Rendering (SSR)\n\nUnlike CSR, which occurs in the browser’s DOM, Angular Universal is responsible for SSR\
  \ of template files. These files are then delivered to the user. Despite this distinction, Angular Universal applies the\
  \ same sanitization mechanisms used in CSR to enhance SSR security. A template injection vulnerability in SSR can be spotted\
  \ in the same way as in CSR, because the used template language is the same.\n\nOf course, there also is a possibility of\
  \ introducing new template injection vulnerabilities when employing third-party template engines such as Pug and Handlebars.\n\
  \n### XSS\n\n#### DOM interfaces\n\nAs previously stated, we can directly access the DOM using the _Document_ interface.\
  \ If user input is not validated beforehand, it can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.\n\nWe used the `document.write()`\
  \ and `document.createElement()` methods in the examples below:\n\n```jsx\n//app.component.ts 1\nimport { Component} from\
  \ '@angular/core';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  template: ''\n})\nexport class AppComponent{\n  constructor\
  \ () {\n    document.open();\n    document.write(\"<script>alert(document.domain)</script>\");\n    document.close();\n\
  \  }\n}\n\n//app.component.ts 2\nimport { Component} from '@angular/core';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  template:\
  \ ''\n})\nexport class AppComponent{\n  constructor () {\n    var d = document.createElement('script');\n    var y = document.createTextNode(\"\
  alert(1)\");\n    d.appendChild(y);\n    document.body.appendChild(d);\n  }\n}\n\n//app.component.ts 3\nimport { Component}\
  \ from '@angular/core';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  template: ''\n})\nexport class AppComponent{\n  constructor\
  \ () {\n\tvar a = document.createElement('img');\n\ta.src='1';\n\ta.setAttribute('onerror','alert(1)');\n\tdocument.body.appendChild(a);\n\
  \  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Angular classes\n\nThere are some classes that can be used to work with DOM elements in Angular: `ElementRef`,\
  \ `Renderer2`, `Location` and `Document`. A detailed description of the last two classes is given in the **Open redirects**\
  \ section. The main difference between the first two is that the `Renderer2` API provides a layer of abstraction between\
  \ the DOM element and the component code, whereas `ElementRef` just holds a reference to the element. Therefore, according\
  \ to Angular documentation, `ElementRef` API should only be used as a last resort when direct access to the DOM is needed.\n\
  \n*   `ElementRef` contains the property `nativeElement`, which can be used to manipulate the DOM elements. However, improper\
  \ usage of `nativeElement` can result in an XSS injection vulnerability, as shown below:\n\n    ```tsx\n    //app.component.ts\n\
  \    import { Component, ElementRef, ViewChild, AfterViewInit } from '@angular/core';\n\n    @Component({\n      selector:\
  \ 'app-root',\n      templateUrl: './app.component.html',\n      styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']\n    })\n    export\
  \ class AppComponent {\n    ...\n      constructor(private elementRef: ElementRef) {\n        const s = document.createElement('script');\n\
  \        s.type = 'text/javascript';\n        s.textContent = 'alert(\"Hello World\")';\n        this.elementRef.nativeElement.appendChild(s);\n\
  \     }\n    }\n    ```\n*   Despite the fact that `Renderer2` provides API that can safely be used even when direct access\
  \ to native elements is not supported, it still has some security flaws. With `Renderer2`, it is possible to set attributes\
  \ on an HTML element using the `setAttribute()` method, which has no XSS prevention mechanisms.\n\n    ```tsx\n    //app.component.ts\n\
  \    import {Component, Renderer2, ElementRef, ViewChild, AfterViewInit } from '@angular/core';\n\n    @Component({\n  \
  \    selector: 'app-root',\n      templateUrl: './app.component.html',\n      styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']\n    })\n\
  \    export class AppComponent {\n      \n      public constructor (\n        private renderer2: Renderer2\n      ){}\n\
  \      @ViewChild(\"img\") img!: ElementRef;\n\n      addAttribute(){\n        this.renderer2.setAttribute(this.img.nativeElement,\
  \ 'src', '1');\n        this.renderer2.setAttribute(this.img.nativeElement, 'onerror', 'alert(1)');\n     }\n    }\n\n \
  \   //app.component.html\n    <img #img>\n    <button (click)=\"setAttribute()\">Click me!</button>\n    ```\n*   To set\
  \ the property of a DOM element, you can use `Renderer2.setProperty()` method and trigger an XSS attack:\n\n    ```tsx\n\
  \    //app.component.ts\n    import {Component, Renderer2, ElementRef, ViewChild, AfterViewInit } from '@angular/core';\n\
  \n    @Component({\n      selector: 'app-root',\n      templateUrl: './app.component.html',\n      styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']\n\
  \    })\n    export class AppComponent {\n      \n      public constructor (\n        private renderer2: Renderer2\n   \
  \   ){}\n      @ViewChild(\"img\") img!: ElementRef;\n\n      setProperty(){\n        this.renderer2.setProperty(this.img.nativeElement,\
  \ 'innerHTML', '<img src=1 onerror=alert(1)>');\n     }\n    }\n\n    //app.component.html\n    <a #a></a>\n    <button\
  \ (click)=\"setProperty()\">Click me!</button>\n    ```\n\nDuring our research, we also examined the behavior of other `Renderer2`\
  \ methods, such as `setStyle()`, `createComment()`, and `setValue()`, in relation to XSS and CSS injections. However, we\
  \ were unable to find any valid attack vectors for these methods due to their functional limitations.\n\n#### jQuery\n\n\
  jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library that can be used in the Angular project to help with manipulation\
  \ the HTML DOM objects. However, as it is known, this library’s methods may be exploited to achieve an XSS vulnerability.\
  \ In order to discuss how some vulnerable jQuery methods can be exploited in Angular projects, we added this subsection.\n\
  \n*   The `html()` method gets the HTML contents of the first element in the set of matched elements or sets the HTML contents\
  \ of every matched element. However, by design, any jQuery constructor or method that accepts an HTML string can potentially\
  \ execute code. This can occur by injection of `<script>` tags or use of HTML attributes that execute code as shown in the\
  \ example.\n\n    ```tsx\n    //app.component.ts\n    import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\n    import * as\
  \ $ from 'jquery';\n\n    @Component({\n      selector: 'app-root',\n      templateUrl: './app.component.html',\n      styleUrls:\
  \ ['./app.component.css']\n    })\n    export class AppComponent implements OnInit \n    {\n      ngOnInit() \n      {\n\
  \        $(\"button\").on(\"click\", function()\n        {\n          $(\"p\").html(\"<script>alert(1)</script>\");\n  \
  \      });\n      }\n    }\n\n    //app.component.html\n    <button>Click me</button>\n    <p>some text here</p>\n    ```\n\
  *   The `jQuery.parseHTML()` method uses native methods to convert the string to a set of DOM nodes, which can then be inserted\
  \ into the document.\n\n    ```tsx\n    jQuery.parseHTML(data [, context ] [, keepScripts ])\n    ```\n\n    As mentioned\
  \ before, most jQuery APIs that accept HTML strings will run scripts that are included in the HTML. The `jQuery.parseHTML()`\
  \ method does not run scripts in the parsed HTML unless `keepScripts` is explicitly `true`. However, it is still possible\
  \ in most environments to execute scripts indirectly; for example, via the `<img onerror>` attribute.\n\n    ```tsx\n  \
  \  //app.component.ts\n    import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\n    import * as $ from 'jquery';\n\n    @Component({\n\
  \      selector: 'app-root',\n      templateUrl: './app.component.html',\n      styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']\n   \
  \ })\n    export class AppComponent implements OnInit \n    {\n      ngOnInit() \n      {\n        $(\"button\").on(\"click\"\
  , function()\n        {\n          var $palias = $(\"#palias\"),\n            str = \"<img src=1 onerror=alert(1)>\",\n\
  \            html = $.parseHTML(str),\n            nodeNames = [];\n          $palias.append(html);\n        });\n     \
  \ }\n    }\n\n    //app.component.html\n    <button>Click me</button>\n    <p id=\"palias\">some text</p>\n    ```\n\n###\
  \ Open redirects\n\n#### DOM interfaces\n\nAccording to the W3C documentation, the `window.location` and `document.location`\
  \ objects are treated as aliases in modern browsers. That is why they have similar implementation of some methods and properties,\
  \ which might cause an open redirect and DOM XSS with `javascript://` schema attacks as mentioned below.\n\n*   `window.location.href`(and\
  \ `document.location.href`)\n\n    The canonical way to get the current DOM location object is using `window.location`.\
  \ It can also be used to redirect the browser to a new page. As a result, having control over this object allows us to exploit\
  \ an open redirect vulnerability.\n\n    ```tsx\n    //app.component.ts\n    ...\n    export class AppComponent {\n    \
  \    goToUrl(): void {\n          window.location.href = \"https://google.com/about\"\n        }\n    }\n\n    //app.component.html\n\
  \    <button type=\"button\" (click)=\"goToUrl()\">Click me!</button>\n    ```\n\n    The exploitation process is identical\
  \ for the following scenarios.\n*   `window.location.assign()`(and `document.location.assign()`)\n\n    This method causes\
  \ the window to load and display the document at the URL specified. If we have control over this method, it might be a sink\
  \ for an open redirect attack.\n\n    ```tsx\n    //app.component.ts\n    ...\n    export class AppComponent {\n       \
  \ goToUrl(): void {\n          window.location.assign(\"https://google.com/about\")\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n*   `window.location.replace()`(and\
  \ `document.location.replace()`)\n\n    This method replaces the current resource with the one at the provided URL.\n\n\
  \    This differs from the `assign()` method is that after using `window.location.replace()`, the current page will not\
  \ be saved in session History. However, it is also possible to exploit an open redirect vulnerability when we have control\
  \ over this method.\n\n    ```tsx\n    //app.component.ts\n    ...\n    export class AppComponent {\n        goToUrl():\
  \ void {\n          window.location.replace(\"http://google.com/about\")\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n*   `window.open()`\n\
  \n    The `window.open()` method takes a URL and loads the resource it identifies into a new or existing tab or window.\
  \ Having control over this method might also be an opportunity to trigger an XSS or open redirect vulnerability.\n\n   \
  \ ```tsx\n    //app.component.ts\n    ...\n    export class AppComponent {\n        goToUrl(): void {\n          window.open(\"\
  https://google.com/about\", \"_blank\")\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n#### Angular classes\n\n*   According to Angular documentation,\
  \ Angular `Document` is the same as the DOM document, which means it is possible to use common vectors for the DOM document\
  \ to exploit client-side vulnerabilities in the Angular. `Document.location` properties and methods might be sinks for successful\
  \ open redirect attacks as shown in the example:\n\n    ```tsx\n    //app.component.ts\n    import { Component, Inject }\
  \ from '@angular/core';\n    import { DOCUMENT } from '@angular/common';\n\n    @Component({\n      selector: 'app-root',\n\
  \      templateUrl: './app.component.html',\n      styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']\n    })\n    export class AppComponent\
  \ {\n      constructor(@Inject(DOCUMENT) private document: Document) { }\n\n      goToUrl(): void {\n          this.document.location.href\
  \ = 'https://google.com/about';\n      }\n    }\n\n    //app.component.html\n    <button type=\"button\" (click)=\"goToUrl()\"\
  >Click me!</button>\n    ```\n*   During the research phase, we also reviewed Angular `Location` class for open redirect\
  \ vulnerabilities, but no valid vectors were found. `Location` is an Angular service that applications can use to interact\
  \ with a browser's current URL. This service has several methods to manipulate the given URL - `go()` , `replaceState()`,\
  \ and `prepareExternalUrl()`. However, we cannot use them for redirection to the external domain. For example:\n\n    ```tsx\n\
  \    //app.component.ts\n    import { Component, Inject } from '@angular/core';\n    import {Location, LocationStrategy,\
  \ PathLocationStrategy} from '@angular/common';\n\n    @Component({\n      selector: 'app-root',\n      templateUrl: './app.component.html',\n\
  \      styleUrls: ['./app.component.css'],\n      providers: [Location, {provide: LocationStrategy, useClass: PathLocationStrategy}],\n\
  \    })\n    export class AppComponent {\n      location: Location;\n      constructor(location: Location) {\n        this.location\
  \ = location;\n      }\n      goToUrl(): void {\n       console.log(this.location.go(\"http://google.com/about\"));\n  \
  \    }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Result: `http://localhost:4200/http://google.com/about`\n*   The Angular `Router` class is\
  \ primarily used for navigating within the same domain and does not introduce any additional vulnerabilities to the application:\n\
  \n    ```jsx\n    //app-routing.module.ts\n    const routes: Routes = [\n    { path: '', redirectTo: 'https://google.com',\
  \ pathMatch: 'full' }]\n    ```\n\n    Result: `http://localhost:4200/https:`\n\n    The following methods also navigate\
  \ within the domain’s scope:\n\n    ```jsx\n    const routes: Routes = [ { path: '', redirectTo: 'ROUTE', pathMatch: 'prefix'\
  \ } ]\n    this.router.navigate(['PATH'])\n    this.router.navigateByUrl('URL')\n    ```\n\n## References\n\n* [Angular](https://angular.io/)\n\
