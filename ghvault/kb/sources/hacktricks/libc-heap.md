  \ where a program is going to be able to store data when it requests data calling functions like **`malloc`**, `calloc`...\
  \ Moreover, when this memory is no longer needed it's made available calling the function **`free`**.\n\nAs it's shown,\
  \ its just after where the binary is being loaded in memory (check the `[heap]` section):\n\n<figure><img src=\"../../images/image\
  \ (1241).png\" alt=\"\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n### Basic Chunk Allocation\n\nWhen some data is requested\
  \ to be stored in the heap, some space of the heap is allocated to it. This space will belong to a bin and only the requested\
  \ data + the space of the bin headers + minimum bin size offset will be reserved for the chunk. The goal is to just reserve\
  \ as minimum memory as possible without making it complicated to find where each chunk is. For this, the metadata chunk\
  \ information is used to know where each used/free chunk is.\n\nThere are different ways to reserver the space mainly depending\
  \ on the used bin, but a general methodology is the following:\n\n- The program starts by requesting certain amount of memory.\n\
  - If in the list of chunks there someone available big enough to fulfil the request, it'll be used\n  - This might even\
  \ mean that part of the available chunk will be used for this request and the rest will be added to the chunks list\n- If\
  \ there isn't any available chunk in the list but there is still space in allocated heap memory, the heap manager creates\
  \ a new chunk\n- If there is not enough heap space to allocate the new chunk, the heap manager asks the kernel to expand\
  \ the memory allocated to the heap and then use this memory to generate the new chunk\n- If everything fails, `malloc` returns\
  \ null.\n\nNote that if the requested **memory passes a threshold**, **`mmap`** will be used to map the requested memory.\n\
  \n## Arenas\n\nIn **multithreaded** applications, the heap manager must prevent **race conditions** that could lead to crashes.\
  \ Initially, this was done using a **global mutex** to ensure that only one thread could access the heap at a time, but\
  \ this caused **performance issues** due to the mutex-induced bottleneck.\n\nTo address this, the ptmalloc2 heap allocator\
  \ introduced \"arenas,\" where **each arena** acts as a **separate heap** with its **own** data **structures** and **mutex**,\
  \ allowing multiple threads to perform heap operations without interfering with each other, as long as they use different\
  \ arenas.\n\nThe default \"main\" arena handles heap operations for single-threaded applications. When **new threads** are\
  \ added, the heap manager assigns them **secondary arenas** to reduce contention. It first attempts to attach each new thread\
  \ to an unused arena, creating new ones if needed, up to a limit of 2 times the number of CPU cores for 32-bit systems and\
  \ 8 times for 64-bit systems. Once the limit is reached, **threads must share arenas**, leading to potential contention.\n\
  \nUnlike the main arena, which expands using the `brk` system call, secondary arenas create \"subheaps\" using `mmap` and\
  \ `mprotect` to simulate the heap behaviour, allowing flexibility in managing memory for multithreaded operations.\n\n###\
  \ Subheaps\n\nSubheaps serve as memory reserves for secondary arenas in multithreaded applications, allowing them to grow\
  \ and manage their own heap regions separately from the main heap. Here's how subheaps differ from the initial heap and\
  \ how they operate:\n\n1. **Initial Heap vs. Subheaps**:\n   - The initial heap is located directly after the program's\
  \ binary in memory, and it expands using the `sbrk` system call.\n   - Subheaps, used by secondary arenas, are created through\
  \ `mmap`, a system call that maps a specified memory region.\n2. **Memory Reservation with `mmap`**:\n   - When the heap\
  \ manager creates a subheap, it reserves a large block of memory through `mmap`. This reservation doesn't allocate memory\
  \ immediately; it simply designates a region that other system processes or allocations shouldn't use.\n   - By default,\
  \ the reserved size for a subheap is 1 MB for 32-bit processes and 64 MB for 64-bit processes.\n3. **Gradual Expansion with\
  \ `mprotect`**:\n   - The reserved memory region is initially marked as `PROT_NONE`, indicating that the kernel doesn't\
  \ need to allocate physical memory to this space yet.\n   - To \"grow\" the subheap, the heap manager uses `mprotect` to\
  \ change page permissions from `PROT_NONE` to `PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE`, prompting the kernel to allocate physical memory\
  \ to the previously reserved addresses. This step-by-step approach allows the subheap to expand as needed.\n   - Once the\
  \ entire subheap is exhausted, the heap manager creates a new subheap to continue allocation.\n\n### heap_info <a href=\"\
  #heap_info\" id=\"heap_info\"></a>\n\nThis struct allocates relevant information of the heap. Moreover, heap memory might\
  \ not be continuous after more allocations, this struct will also store that info.\n\n```c\n// From https://github.com/bminor/glibc/blob/a07e000e82cb71238259e674529c37c12dc7d423/malloc/arena.c#L837\n\
  \ntypedef struct _heap_info\n{\n  mstate ar_ptr; /* Arena for this heap. */\n  struct _heap_info *prev; /* Previous heap.\
  \ */\n  size_t size;   /* Current size in bytes. */\n  size_t mprotect_size; /* Size in bytes that has been mprotected\n\
  \                           PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE.  */\n  size_t pagesize; /* Page size used when allocating the arena. \
  \ */\n  /* Make sure the following data is properly aligned, particularly\n     that sizeof (heap_info) + 2 * SIZE_SZ is\
  \ a multiple of\n     MALLOC_ALIGNMENT. */\n  char pad[-3 * SIZE_SZ & MALLOC_ALIGN_MASK];\n} heap_info;\n```\n\n### malloc_state\n\
  \n**Each heap** (main arena or other threads arenas) has a **`malloc_state` structure.**\\\nIt’s important to notice that\
  \ the **main arena `malloc_state`** structure is a **global variable in the libc** (therefore located in the libc memory\
  \ space).\\\nIn the case of **`malloc_state`** structures of the heaps of threads, they are located **inside own thread\
  \ \"heap\"**.\n\nThere some interesting things to note from this structure (see C code below):\n\n- `__libc_lock_define\
  \ (, mutex);` Is there to make sure this structure from the heap is accessed by 1 thread at a time\n- Flags:\n\n  - ```c\n\
  \    #define NONCONTIGUOUS_BIT     (2U)\n\n    #define contiguous(M)          (((M)->flags & NONCONTIGUOUS_BIT) == 0)\n\
  \    #define noncontiguous(M)       (((M)->flags & NONCONTIGUOUS_BIT) != 0)\n    #define set_noncontiguous(M)   ((M)->flags\
  \ |= NONCONTIGUOUS_BIT)\n    #define set_contiguous(M)      ((M)->flags &= ~NONCONTIGUOUS_BIT)\n    ```\n\n- The `mchunkptr\
  \ bins[NBINS * 2 - 2];` contains **pointers** to the **first and last chunks** of the small, large and unsorted **bins**\
  \ (the -2 is because the index 0 is not used)\n  - Therefore, the **first chunk** of these bins will have a **backwards\
  \ pointer to this structure** and the **last chunk** of these bins will have a **forward pointer** to this structure. Which\
  \ basically means that if you can l**eak these addresses in the main arena** you will have a pointer to the structure in\
  \ the **libc**.\n- The structs `struct malloc_state *next;` and `struct malloc_state *next_free;` are linked lists os arenas\n\
  - The `top` chunk is the last \"chunk\", which is basically **all the heap reminding space**. Once the top chunk is \"empty\"\
  , the heap is completely used and it needs to request more space.\n- The `last reminder` chunk comes from cases where an\
  \ exact size chunk is not available and therefore a bigger chunk is splitter, a pointer remaining part is placed here.\n\
  \n```c\n// From https://github.com/bminor/glibc/blob/a07e000e82cb71238259e674529c37c12dc7d423/malloc/malloc.c#L1812\n\n\
  struct malloc_state\n{\n  /* Serialize access.  */\n  __libc_lock_define (, mutex);\n\n  /* Flags (formerly in max_fast).\
  \  */\n  int flags;\n\n  /* Set if the fastbin chunks contain recently inserted free blocks.  */\n  /* Note this is a bool\
  \ but not all targets support atomics on booleans.  */\n  int have_fastchunks;\n\n  /* Fastbins */\n  mfastbinptr fastbinsY[NFASTBINS];\n\
  \n  /* Base of the topmost chunk -- not otherwise kept in a bin */\n  mchunkptr top;\n\n  /* The remainder from the most\
  \ recent split of a small request */\n  mchunkptr last_remainder;\n\n  /* Normal bins packed as described above */\n  mchunkptr\
  \ bins[NBINS * 2 - 2];\n\n  /* Bitmap of bins */\n  unsigned int binmap[BINMAPSIZE];\n\n  /* Linked list */\n  struct malloc_state\
  \ *next;\n\n  /* Linked list for free arenas.  Access to this field is serialized\n     by free_list_lock in arena.c.  */\n\
  \  struct malloc_state *next_free;\n\n  /* Number of threads attached to this arena.  0 if the arena is on\n     the free\
  \ list.  Access to this field is serialized by\n     free_list_lock in arena.c.  */\n  INTERNAL_SIZE_T attached_threads;\n\
  \n  /* Memory allocated from the system in this arena.  */\n  INTERNAL_SIZE_T system_mem;\n  INTERNAL_SIZE_T max_system_mem;\n\
  };\n```\n\n### malloc_chunk\n\nThis structure represents a particular chunk of memory. The various fields have different\
  \ meaning for allocated and unallocated chunks.\n\n```c\n// https://github.com/bminor/glibc/blob/master/malloc/malloc.c\n\
  struct malloc_chunk {\n  INTERNAL_SIZE_T      mchunk_prev_size;  /* Size of previous chunk, if it is free. */\n  INTERNAL_SIZE_T\
  \      mchunk_size;       /* Size in bytes, including overhead. */\n  struct malloc_chunk* fd;                /* double\
  \ links -- used only if this chunk is free. */\n  struct malloc_chunk* bk;\n  /* Only used for large blocks: pointer to\
  \ next larger size.  */\n  struct malloc_chunk* fd_nextsize; /* double links -- used only if this chunk is free. */\n  struct\
  \ malloc_chunk* bk_nextsize;\n};\n\ntypedef struct malloc_chunk* mchunkptr;\n```\n\nAs commented previously, these chunks\
  \ also have some metadata, very good represented in this image:\n\n<figure><img src=\"../../images/image (1242).png\" alt=\"\
  \"><figcaption><p><a href=\"https://azeria-labs.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/chunk-allocated-CS.png\">https://azeria-labs.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/chunk-allocated-CS.png</a></p></figcaption></figure>\n\
  \nThe metadata is usually 0x08B indicating the current chunk size using the last 3 bits to indicate:\n\n- `A`: If 1 it comes\
  \ from a subheap, if 0 it's in the main arena\n- `M`: If 1, this chunk is part of a space allocated with mmap and not part\
  \ of a heap\n- `P`: If 1, the previous chunk is in use\n\nThen, the space for the user data, and finally 0x08B to indicate\
  \ the previous chunk size when the chunk is available (or to store user data when it's allocated).\n\nMoreover, when available,\
  \ the user data is used to contain also some data:\n\n- **`fd`**: Pointer to the next chunk\n- **`bk`**: Pointer to the\
  \ previous chunk\n- **`fd_nextsize`**: Pointer to the first chunk in the list is smaller than itself\n- **`bk_nextsize`:**\
  \ Pointer to the first chunk the list that is larger than itself\n\n<figure><img src=\"../../images/image (1243).png\" alt=\"\

  \n> [!TIP]\n> Note how liking the list this way prevents the need to having an array where every single chunk is being registered.\n\
  \n### Chunk Pointers\n\nWhen malloc is used a pointer to the content that can be written is returned (just after the headers),\
  \ however, when managing chunks, it's needed a pointer to the begining of the headers (metadata).\\\nFor these conversions\
  \ these functions are used:\n\n```c\n// https://github.com/bminor/glibc/blob/master/malloc/malloc.c\n\n/* Convert a chunk\
  \ address to a user mem pointer without correcting the tag.  */\n#define chunk2mem(p) ((void*)((char*)(p) + CHUNK_HDR_SZ))\n\
  \n/* Convert a user mem pointer to a chunk address and extract the right tag.  */\n#define mem2chunk(mem) ((mchunkptr)tag_at\
  \ (((char*)(mem) - CHUNK_HDR_SZ)))\n\n/* The smallest possible chunk */\n#define MIN_CHUNK_SIZE        (offsetof(struct\
  \ malloc_chunk, fd_nextsize))\n\n/* The smallest size we can malloc is an aligned minimal chunk */\n\n#define MINSIZE  \\\
  \n  (unsigned long)(((MIN_CHUNK_SIZE+MALLOC_ALIGN_MASK) & ~MALLOC_ALIGN_MASK))\n```\n\n### Alignment & min size\n\nThe pointer\
  \ to the chunk and `0x0f` must be 0.\n\n```c\n// From https://github.com/bminor/glibc/blob/a07e000e82cb71238259e674529c37c12dc7d423/sysdeps/generic/malloc-size.h#L61\n\
  #define MALLOC_ALIGN_MASK (MALLOC_ALIGNMENT - 1)\n\n// https://github.com/bminor/glibc/blob/a07e000e82cb71238259e674529c37c12dc7d423/sysdeps/i386/malloc-alignment.h\n\
  #define MALLOC_ALIGNMENT 16\n\n\n// https://github.com/bminor/glibc/blob/master/malloc/malloc.c\n/* Check if m has acceptable\
  \ alignment */\n#define aligned_OK(m)  (((unsigned long)(m) & MALLOC_ALIGN_MASK) == 0)\n\n#define misaligned_chunk(p) \\\
  \n  ((uintptr_t)(MALLOC_ALIGNMENT == CHUNK_HDR_SZ ? (p) : chunk2mem (p)) \\\n   & MALLOC_ALIGN_MASK)\n\n\n/* pad request\
  \ bytes into a usable size -- internal version */\n/* Note: This must be a macro that evaluates to a compile time constant\n\
  \   if passed a literal constant.  */\n#define request2size(req)                                         \\\n  (((req) +\
  \ SIZE_SZ + MALLOC_ALIGN_MASK < MINSIZE)  ?             \\\n   MINSIZE :                                               \
  \       \\\n   ((req) + SIZE_SZ + MALLOC_ALIGN_MASK) & ~MALLOC_ALIGN_MASK)\n\n/* Check if REQ overflows when padded and\
  \ aligned and if the resulting\n   value is less than PTRDIFF_T.  Returns the requested size or\n   MINSIZE in case the\
  \ value is less than MINSIZE, or 0 if any of the\n   previous checks fail.  */\nstatic inline size_t\nchecked_request2size\
  \ (size_t req) __nonnull (1)\n{\n  if (__glibc_unlikely (req > PTRDIFF_MAX))\n    return 0;\n\n  /* When using tagged memory,\
  \ we cannot share the end of the user\n     block with the header for the next chunk, so ensure that we\n     allocate blocks\
  \ that are rounded up to the granule size.  Take\n     care not to overflow from close to MAX_SIZE_T to a small\n     number.\
  \  Ideally, this would be part of request2size(), but that\n     must be a macro that produces a compile time constant if\
  \ passed\n     a constant literal.  */\n  if (__glibc_unlikely (mtag_enabled))\n    {\n      /* Ensure this is not evaluated\
  \ if !mtag_enabled, see gcc PR 99551.  */\n      asm (\"\");\n\n      req = (req + (__MTAG_GRANULE_SIZE - 1)) &\n\t    ~(size_t)(__MTAG_GRANULE_SIZE\
  \ - 1);\n    }\n\n  return request2size (req);\n}\n```\n\nNote that for calculating the total space needed it's only added\
  \ `SIZE_SZ` 1 time because the `prev_size` field can be used to store data, therefore only the initial header is needed.\n\
  \n### Get Chunk data and alter metadata\n\nThese functions work by receiving a pointer to a chunk and are useful to check/set\
  \ metadata:\n\n- Check chunk flags\n\n```c\n// From https://github.com/bminor/glibc/blob/master/malloc/malloc.c\n\n\n/*\

  \ Quick Heap Example\n\nQuick heap example from [https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/25-heap/index.html](https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/25-heap/index.html)\
  \ but in arm64:\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\nvoid main(void)\n{\n    char *ptr;\n\
  \    ptr = malloc(0x10);\n    strcpy(ptr, \"panda\");\n}\n```\n\nSet a breakpoint at the end of the main function and lets\
  \ find out where the information was stored:\n\n<figure><img src=\"../../images/image (1239).png\" alt=\"\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\
  \nIt's possible to see that the string panda was stored at `0xaaaaaaac12a0` (which was the address given as response by\
  \ malloc inside `x0`). Checking 0x10 bytes before it's possible to see that the `0x0` represents that the **previous chunk\
  \ is not used** (length 0) and that the length of this chunk is `0x21`.\n\nThe extra spaces reserved (0x21-0x10=0x11) comes\
  \ from the **added headers** (0x10) and 0x1 doesn't mean that it was reserved 0x21B but the last 3 bits of the length of\
  \ the current headed have the some special meanings. As the length is always 16-byte aligned (in 64bits machines), these\
  \ bits are actually never going to be used by the length number.\n\n```\n0x1:     Previous in Use     - Specifies that the\
  \ chunk before it in memory is in use\n0x2:     Is MMAPPED          - Specifies that the chunk was obtained with mmap()\n\
  0x4:     Non Main Arena      - Specifies that the chunk was obtained from outside of the main arena\n```\n\n### Multithreading\

  \ at the beginning there is only 1 arena:\n\n<figure><img src=\"../../images/image (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png\"\
  \ alt=\"\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\nThen, after calling the first thread, the one that calls malloc, a new\
  \ arena is created:\n\n<figure><img src=\"../../images/image (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png\" alt=\"\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\
  \nand inside of it some chunks can be found:\n\n<figure><img src=\"../../images/image (2) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png\" alt=\"\
  \"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n## Bins & Memory Allocations/Frees\n\nCheck what are the bins and how are they\
  \ organized and how memory is allocated and freed in:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nbins-and-memory-allocations.md\n{{#endref}}\n\n## Heap\
  \ Functions Security Checks\n\nFunctions involved in heap will perform certain check before performing its actions to try\
  \ to make sure the heap wasn't corrupted:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nheap-memory-functions/heap-functions-security-checks.md\n{{#endref}}\n\
  \  \n## musl mallocng exploitation notes (Alpine)\n\n- **Slab group/slot grooming for huge linear copies:** mallocng sizeclasses\
  \ use mmap()'d groups whose slots are fully `munmap()`'d when empty. For long linear copies (~0x15555555 bytes), keep the\
  \ span mapped (avoid holes from released groups) and place the victim allocation adjacent to the source slot.\n- **Cycling\
  \ offset mitigation:** On slot reuse mallocng may advance the user-data start by `UNIT` (0x10) multiples when slack fits\
  \ an extra 4-byte header. This shifts overwrite offsets (e.g., LSB pointer hits) unless you control reuse counts or stick\
  \ to strides without slack (e.g., Lua `Table` objects at stride 0x50 show offset 0). Inspect offsets with muslheap’s `mchunkinfo`:\n\
  \n```gdb\npwndbg> mchunkinfo 0x7ffff7a94e40\n... stride: 0x140\n... cycling offset : 0x1 (userdata --> 0x7ffff7a94e40)\n\
  ```\n\n- **Prefer runtime-object corruption over allocator metadata:** mallocng mixes cookies/guarded out-of-band metadata,\
  \ so target higher-level objects. In Redis’s Lua 5.1, `Table->array` points to an array of `TValue` tagged values; overwriting\
  \ the LSB of a pointer in `TValue->value` (e.g., with the JSON terminator byte `0x22`) can pivot references without touching\
  \ malloc metadata.\n- **Debugging stripped/static Lua on Alpine:** Build a matching Lua, list symbols with `readelf -Ws`,\
  \ strip function symbols via `objcopy --strip-symbol` to expose struct layouts in GDB, then use Lua-aware pretty-printers\
  \ (GdbLuaExtension for Lua 5.1) plus muslheap to check stride/reserved/cycling-offset values before triggering the overflow.\n\
