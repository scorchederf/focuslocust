  \ consists of the **creation of a legitimate Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) impersonating any user** through the use of the\
  \ **NTLM hash of the Active Directory (AD) krbtgt account**. This technique is particularly advantageous because it **enables\
  \ access to any service or machine** within the domain as the impersonated user. It's crucial to remember that the **krbtgt\
  \ account's credentials are never automatically updated**.\n\nTo **acquire the NTLM hash** of the krbtgt account, various\
  \ methods can be employed. It can be extracted from the **Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) process** or\
  \ the **NT Directory Services (NTDS.dit) file** located on any Domain Controller (DC) within the domain. Furthermore, **executing\
  \ a DCsync attack** is another strategy to obtain this NTLM hash, which can be performed using tools such as the **lsadump::dcsync\
  \ module** in Mimikatz or the **secretsdump.py script** by Impacket. It's important to underscore that to undertake these\
  \ operations, **domain admin privileges or a similar level of access is typically required**.\n\nAlthough the NTLM hash\
  \ serves as a viable method for this purpose, it is **strongly recommended** to **forge tickets using the Advanced Encryption\
  \ Standard (AES) Kerberos keys (AES128 and AES256)** for operational security reasons. This is even more important in modern\
  \ domains because **RC4 usage is being phased out** and stands out much more clearly in Kerberos telemetry.\n\n```bash:From\
  \ Linux\npython ticketer.py -nthash 25b2076cda3bfd6209161a6c78a69c1c -domain-sid S-1-5-21-1339291983-1349129144-367733775\

  \ need to put the SID)\n## The /printcmd option will print the complete command if later you want to generate a token offline\n\

  \ /ticket:golden.kirbi\n```\n\n### Modern ticket crafting notes\n\nWhen possible, **query LDAP and SYSVOL first** and then\
  \ forge the ticket using the real domain policy and user PAC values instead of inventing them manually:\n\n```bash\nRubeus.exe\
  \ golden /aes256:<krbtgt_aes256> /user:<username> /ldap /printcmd /nowrap\n```\n\n- `/ldap` asks the DC for the user, group,\
  \ NetBIOS and policy data used to build a more realistic PAC.\n- `/printcmd` prints an offline command line containing the\
  \ retrieved PAC fields, which is useful if you later want to forge the same ticket without touching LDAP again.\n- `/extendedupndns`\
  \ adds the newer `UpnDns` PAC elements containing the `samAccountName` and account SID.\n- `/oldpac` removes the newer `Requestor`\
  \ and `Attributes` PAC buffers; this is mainly useful for compatibility testing against older environments, not for default\
  \ tradecraft.\n\nFrom Linux, recent Impacket versions also support adding the newer PAC structures and setting a realistic\
  \ validity period:\n\n```bash\npython3 ticketer.py -aesKey <krbtgt_aes256> -domain-sid <DOMAIN_SID> -domain <DOMAIN> \\\n\
  \  -user-id 500 -groups 512,513,518,519 -duration 10 \\\n  -extra-pac administrator\n```\n\n- `-duration` is in **hours**.\
  \ The default is **10 years**, which is noisy.\n- `-extra-pac` adds the newer `UPN_DNS` PAC information.\n- `-old-pac` forces\
  \ the legacy PAC layout.\n- `-extra-sid` is useful when the PAC needs additional SIDs (for example, in child-to-parent escalation\
  \ scenarios, which are covered in [SID-History Injection](sid-history-injection.md)).\n\n**Once** you have the **golden\
  \ Ticket injected**, you can access the shared files **(C$)**, and execute services and WMI, so you could use **psexec**\
  \ or **wmiexec** to obtain a shell (looks like you cannot get a shell via winrm).\n\n### Bypassing common detections\n\n\
  The most frequent ways to detect a golden ticket are by **inspecting Kerberos traffic** on the wire. By default, Mimikatz\
  \ **signs the TGT for 10 years**, which will stand out as anomalous in subsequent TGS requests made with it.\n\n`Lifetime\
  \ : 3/11/2021 12:39:57 PM ; 3/9/2031 12:39:57 PM ; 3/9/2031 12:39:57 PM`\n\nUse the `/startoffset`, `/endin` and `/renewmax`\
  \ parameters to control the start offset, duration and the maximum renewals (all in minutes).\n\n```\nGet-DomainPolicy |\
  \ select -expand KerberosPolicy\n```\n\nUnfortunately, the TGT's lifetime is not logged in 4769's, so you won't find this\
  \ information in the Windows event logs. However, what you can correlate is **seeing 4769's without a prior 4768**. It's\
  \ **not possible to request a TGS without a TGT**, and if there is no record of a TGT being issued, we can infer that it\
  \ was forged offline.\n\nIn **newer Windows builds**, Event IDs **4768** and **4769** also expose much better **encryption\
  \ type telemetry**. A forged TGT/TGS using **RC4 (`0x17`)** in a domain where `krbtgt`, clients and services already have\
  \ AES keys is much easier to spot than it was a few years ago. This is one more reason to prefer **AES-backed Golden Tickets**\
  \ and to match the domain's normal Kerberos policy as closely as possible.\n\nAnother OPSEC issue is **PAC fidelity**. Tickets\
  \ with impossible group memberships, missing newer PAC buffers, or account metadata that doesn't match LDAP are easier to\
  \ detect when defenders validate PAC contents against AD data. If you need a TGT that looks like it was really issued by\
  \ a DC, review:\n\n{{#ref}}\ndiamond-ticket.md\n{{#endref}}\n\nThere are also **environmental limits** to persistence. The\
  \ `krbtgt` account keeps a **password history of 2**, so a forged TGT can remain valid across the **first** `krbtgt` reset\
  \ if it was signed with the previous key. This is why defenders invalidate Golden Tickets by **resetting `krbtgt` twice**\
  \ and waiting at least the domain's maximum ticket lifetime between resets.\n\nIn order to **bypass this detection** check\
  \ the diamond tickets.\n\n### Mitigation\n\n- 4624: Account Logon\n- 4672: Admin Logon\n- `Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable\
  \ @{Logname='Security';ID=4672} -MaxEvents 1 | Format-List –Property`\n\nOther little tricks defenders can do are **alert\
  \ on 4769's for sensitive users** such as the default domain administrator account and alert on **RC4 usage for `krbtgt`**\
  \ in domains that normally issue AES tickets.\n\n## References\n\n- [https://www.tarlogic.com/blog/how-to-attack-kerberos/](https://www.tarlogic.com/blog/how-to-attack-kerberos/)\n\
