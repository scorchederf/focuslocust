  \ Execution\n\nThere will be occasions where you can execute some limited javascript in a page. For example, in the case\
  \ where you can[ **control a callback value that will be executed**](#javascript-function).\n\nIn those case, one of the\
  \ best things that you could do is to **access the DOM to call whatever** sensitive action you can find in there (like clicking\
  \ a button). However, usually you will find this vulnerability in **small endpoints without any interesting thing in the\
  \ DOM**.\n\nIn those scenarios, this attack will be very useful, because its goal is to be able to **abuse the limited JS\
  \ execution inside a DOM from a different page from the same domain** with much interesting actions.\n\nBasically, the attack\
  \ flow is the following:\n\n- Find a **callback that you can abuse** (potentially limited to \\[\\w\\\\.\\_]).\n  - If it's\
  \ not limited and you can execute any JS, you could just abuse this as a regular XSS\n- Make the **victim open a page**\
  \ controlled by the **attacker**\n- The **page will open itself** in a **different window** (the new window will have the\
  \ object **`opener`** referencing the initial one)\n- The **initial page** will load the **page** where the **interesting\
  \ DOM** is located.\n- The **second page** will load the **vulnerable page abusing the callback** and using the **`opener`**\
  \ object to **access and execute some action in the initial page** (which now contains the interesting DOM).\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n\
  > Note that even if the initial page access to a new URL after having created the second page, the **`opener` object of\
  \ the second page is still a valid reference to the first page in the new DOM**.\n>\n> Moreover, in order for the second\
  \ page to be able to use the opener object **both pages must be in the same origin**. This is the reason why, in order to\
  \ abuse this vulnerability, you need to find some sort of **XSS in the same origin**.\n\n### Exploitation\n\n- You can use\
  \ this form to **generate a PoC** to exploit this type of vulnerability: [https://www.someattack.com/Playground/SOMEGenerator](https://www.someattack.com/Playground/SOMEGenerator)\n\
  - In order to find a DOM path to a HTML element with a click you can use this browser extension: [https://www.someattack.com/Playground/targeting_tool](https://www.someattack.com/Playground/targeting_tool)\n\
  \n### Example\n\n- You can find a vulnerable example in [https://www.someattack.com/Playground/](https://www.someattack.com/Playground/)\n\
  \  - Note that in this example the server is **generating javascript code** and **adding** it to the HTML based on the **content\
  \ of the callback parameter:** `<script>opener.{callbacl_content}</script>` . Thats why in this example you don't need to\
  \ indicate the use of `opener` explicitly.\n- Also check this CTF writeup: [https://ctftime.org/writeup/36068](https://ctftime.org/writeup/36068)\n\
