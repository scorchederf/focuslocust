_body: "# Shizuku Privileged API\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\nShizuku is an open-source service\
  \ that **starts a privileged Java process with `app_process`** and exposes selected **Android system APIs over Binder**.\n\
  Because the process runs with the same **`shell` UID capabilities that ADB uses**, an app that is explicitly authorised\
  \ by the user can proxy Binder calls to system services **without rooting the device**.\n\nIn practice, this means a Shizuku-enabled\
  \ app can often exercise the same primitives as `adb shell`: package management, `appops`, `settings`, `cmd connectivity`,\
  \ log collection, and many other shell-allowed Binder transactions. It is still **not root** and it is still constrained\
  \ by **Android permissions, Linux UID checks, SELinux policy, Android version, and OEM-specific restrictions**.\n\nTypical\
  \ use cases:\n* Security auditing from an un-rooted handset\n* On-device package management, debloating and split-APK installation\n\
  * Collecting logs, package metadata and shell-visible network/process state\n* Building PoCs or helper tooling that need\
  \ **ADB-grade** access but not a full root chain\n\n---\n## 1. Starting the privileged service\n\n`moe.shizuku.privileged.api`\
  \ can be started in three different ways. The Binder interface exposed to client apps is the same, but the effective privilege\
  \ depends on whether the backend is **ADB/shell** or **root**.\n\n### 1.1 Wireless ADB (Android 11+)\n1. Enable **Developer\
  \ Options -> Wireless debugging** and pair the device.\n2. Inside the Shizuku app select **\"Start via Wireless debugging\"\
  **.\n3. The session survives until reboot unless the OEM ROM kills wireless debugging or revokes the debugging authorisation.\n\
  \n### 1.2 USB / local ADB one-liner\n```bash\nadb shell sh /sdcard/Android/data/moe.shizuku.privileged.api/start.sh\n```\n\
  The same script can be executed over a **network ADB** connection (`adb connect <IP>:5555`).\n\n### 1.3 Rooted devices\n\
  If the device is already rooted run:\n```bash\nsu -c sh /data/adb/shizuku/start.sh\n```\n\n### 1.4 OEM quirks that matter\
  \ during testing\n* **MIUI / HyperOS** often requires **USB debugging (Security settings)** in addition to the normal USB\
  \ debugging toggle.\n* **ColorOS / OxygenOS** commonly requires disabling **Permission monitoring** or equivalent security\
  \ wrappers.\n* On Android 11+, **Disable adb authorization timeout** reduces random Shizuku loss during long test sessions.\n\
  * If wireless startup keeps failing, allow Shizuku to run in the background; several OEM ROMs suspend local-network discovery\
  \ when the app is backgrounded.\n\n### 1.5 Verifying that it is running\n```bash\nadb shell dumpsys activity service moe.shizuku.privileged.api\
  \ | head\nadb shell service list | grep shizuku\n```\nA successful start returns a running service and exposes a Binder\
  \ service related to `moe.shizuku.privileged.api`.\n\n---\n## 2. Binding from an application\n\nA Shizuku-enabled app does\
  \ **not** use the raw Binder returned by Shizuku as if it were `IPackageManager`. The normal flow is:\n1. add the Shizuku\
  \ API permission and `ShizukuProvider`,\n2. wait for the Shizuku Binder to appear,\n3. request Shizuku's runtime-style authorisation\
  \ from the user,\n4. wrap the target system-service Binder with `ShizukuBinderWrapper`.\n\nManifest requirements:\n```xml\n\
  <uses-permission android:name=\"moe.shizuku.manager.permission.API\"/>\n\n<provider\n    android:name=\"rikka.shizuku.ShizukuProvider\"\
  \n    android:authorities=\"${applicationId}.shizuku\"\n    android:multiprocess=\"false\"\n    android:enabled=\"true\"\
  \n    android:exported=\"true\"\n    android:permission=\"android.permission.INTERACT_ACROSS_USERS_FULL\" />\n```\n\nMinimal\
  \ Binder-wrapper example:\n```java\nShizuku.addBinderReceivedListenerSticky(() -> {\n    if (Shizuku.checkSelfPermission()\
  \ != PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED) {\n        Shizuku.requestPermission(1000);\n        return;\n    }\n\n    IPackageManager\
  \ pm = IPackageManager.Stub.asInterface(\n        new ShizukuBinderWrapper(SystemServiceHelper.getSystemService(\"package\"\
  ))\n    );\n});\n```\n\nThat wrapper is what causes Binder transactions to be forwarded by the Shizuku service process instead\
  \ of being executed with the caller app's normal UID.\n\n### 2.1 UserService: when you need more than a single Binder call\n\
  For anything more complex than direct Binder transactions, modern Shizuku development prefers **UserService** instead of\
  \ the old `newProcess` helper. A UserService runs **your own Java/JNI code** in a separate process as **UID 2000 (`shell`)**\
  \ when Shizuku was started via ADB or **UID 0** when backed by root.\n\n```java\nShizuku.UserServiceArgs args = new Shizuku.UserServiceArgs(\n\
  \    new ComponentName(this, AuditService.class))\n    .daemon(false)\n    .version(1)\n    .processNameSuffix(\"audit\"\
  );\n\nShizuku.bindUserService(args, conn);\n```\n\nThis is useful for offensive tooling that needs long-lived state, JNI\
  \ helpers, or repeated Binder operations without paying the cost of spawning shell commands over and over. Remember that\
  \ the service is **not a normal app process**: some `Context` methods do not behave like they do inside a regular Android\
  \ application.\n\n### 2.2 Boundaries that still apply\n* **ADB/shell and root are different privilege levels.** `Shizuku.getUid()`\
  \ returns `2000` for shell-backed sessions and `0` for root-backed sessions.\n* Shell permissions **change between Android\
  \ releases** and can also be trimmed by OEMs.\n* Shell still cannot directly read another app's private sandbox such as\
  \ `/data/user/0/<package>`.\n* Hidden API restrictions still apply to code running in the normal app process; if you need\
  \ non-SDK interfaces extensively, move the logic into a UserService or use a dedicated hidden-API bypass.\n\n---\n## 3.\
  \ Rish - elevated shell inside Termux\nThe Shizuku settings screen exposes **\"Use Shizuku in terminal apps\"**. Enabling\
  \ it downloads `rish`, which opens a remote privileged shell backed by Shizuku.\n\n```bash\npkg install wget\nwget https://rikka.app/rish/latest\
  \ -O rish && chmod +x rish\n\n# start elevated shell (inherits the binder connection)\n./rish\nwhoami   # -> shell\nid \
  \      # uid=2000(shell) gid=2000(shell) groups=... context=u:r:shell:s0\n```\n\nUseful detail for Termux-heavy workflows:\
  \ when Shizuku runs as ADB/shell, `rish` intentionally avoids preserving Termux's environment by default because the shell\
  \ user usually cannot traverse Termux-private paths.\n\n### 3.1 Useful commands from the `rish` shell\n* List running processes\
  \ of a given package:\n  ```bash\n  ps -A | grep com.facebook.katana\n  ```\n* Enumerate listening sockets and map them\
  \ to packages:\n  ```bash\n  netstat -tuln\n  for pid in $(lsof -nP -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN -t); do\n      printf \"%s -> %s\\\
  n\" \"$pid\" \"$(cat /proc/$pid/cmdline)\";\n  done\n  ```\n* Dump every application's logs exposed to shell:\n  ```bash\n\
  \  logcat -d | grep -iE \"(error|exception)\"\n  ```\n* Bulk debloat (example):\n  ```bash\n  pm uninstall --user 0 com.miui.weather2\n\
  \  ```\n* Inspect users and profile layout before multi-user abuse:\n  ```bash\n  pm list users\n  dumpsys user\n  ```\n\
  \n### 3.2 Modern abuse patterns enabled by shell-backed Shizuku\n\n#### AppOps and special-permission tampering\nShizuku-enabled\
  \ managers such as App Ops or App Manager are effectively wrapping shell-authorised `appops` and package-manager Binder\
  \ calls. From `rish`, the same primitive can be used directly:\n\n```bash\ncmd appops get com.target.app\ncmd appops set\
  \ --uid com.target.app RUN_IN_BACKGROUND ignore\ncmd appops set com.target.app SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW allow\n```\n\nThis is\
  \ useful during pentests to validate whether an app or MDM agent actually tolerates aggressive AppOps manipulation without\
  \ requiring root.\n\n#### Per-app network isolation without VPN or root\nRecent Shizuku-based tools such as ShizuWall use\
  \ the `connectivity` service's **chain-3** controls to block networking for selected packages:\n\n```bash\ncmd connectivity\
  \ set-chain3-enabled true\ncmd connectivity set-package-networking-enabled false com.example.agent\ncmd connectivity set-package-networking-enabled\
  \ true com.example.agent\n```\n\nFor assessments, this gives you a fast way to test how a target app behaves when a competing\
  \ security, telemetry or management package is selectively cut off from the network while the rest of the device remains\
  \ online. The state is cleared on reboot.\n\n#### On-device advanced installs and split APK workflows\nModern Shizuku installers\
  \ such as InstallWithOptions or InstallerX-Revived use shell-backed `PackageInstaller` access to perform operations that\
  \ are otherwise awkward from a normal app: split APK installs, test-only packages, batch installs, and some Android 14 package-install\
  \ flags.\n\nFrom an offensive-testing point of view, the important part is not the GUI but the primitive: **Shizuku turns\
  \ package installation back into an on-device shell-authorised action**, which is useful for persistence tests, downgrade\
  \ checks and rapid deployment of helper payloads on a non-rooted handset.\n\n#### Work-profile and secondary-user boundaries\n\
  Shell-backed Shizuku is still subject to Android's user restrictions. On managed profiles you will often hit errors such\
  \ as:\n\n```text\nINSTALL_FAILED_USER_RESTRICTED\nShell does not have permission to access user X\n```\n\nIf you are specifically\
  \ testing work-profile bypasses or required-app replacement, keep that material in the dedicated page instead of duplicating\
  \ it here:\n[Android Enterprise Work Profile Required-App Replacement](android-enterprise-work-profile-bypass.md)\n\n---\n\
  ## 4. Security considerations / detection\n1. Shizuku needs **ADB debugging** or **root** first, so _Developer Options ->\
  \ USB/Wireless debugging_ must be enabled on non-rooted devices.\n2. The service registers itself under the name `moe.shizuku.privileged.api`.\n\
  \   `adb shell service list | grep shizuku` and `adb shell dumpsys activity service moe.shizuku.privileged.api` are reliable\
  \ quick checks.\n3. Capabilities are limited to what the current backend has. On ADB-backed sessions, that means the effective\
  \ attack surface is the one exposed to **`com.android.shell`** on that Android build, plus whatever SELinux permits.\n4.\
  \ Sessions do **not** survive a reboot unless the device is rooted and Shizuku is configured as a startup daemon.\n5. OEM\
  \ \"security\" layers often break or silently reduce Shizuku functionality. If a command works via direct `adb shell` but\
  \ fails through Shizuku, compare the current backend UID (`Shizuku.getUid()`), OEM debugging toggles, and whether the device\
  \ trimmed shell permissions.\n\n---\n## 5. Mitigation\n* Disable USB/Wireless debugging on production devices.\n* Monitor\
  \ for Binder services exposing `moe.shizuku.privileged.api`.\n* Enforce work-profile or MDM restrictions that remove debugging\
  \ features from managed users.\n* Treat Shizuku-compatible tooling as **ADB-equivalent** during threat modelling; it is\
  \ a post-exploitation force multiplier even when the device is not rooted.\n\n---\n## References\n\n- [Shizuku Official\
