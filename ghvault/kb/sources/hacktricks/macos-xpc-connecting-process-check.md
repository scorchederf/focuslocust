  \ Process Check\n\nWhen a connection is stablished to an XPC service, the server will check if the connection is allowed.\
  \ These are the checks it would usually perform:\n\n1. Check if the connecting **process is signed with an Apple-signed**\
  \ certificate (only given out by Apple).\n   - If this **isn't verified**, an attacker could create a **fake certificate**\
  \ to match any other check.\n2. Check if the connecting process is signed with the **organization’s certificate**, (team\
  \ ID verification).\n   - If this **isn't verified**, **any developer certificate** from Apple can be used for signing,\
  \ and connect to the service.\n3. Check if the connecting process **contains a proper bundle ID**.\n   - If this **isn't\
  \ verified**, any tool **signed by the same org** could be used to interact with the XPC service.\n4. (4 or 5) Check if\
  \ the connecting process has a **proper software version number**.\n   - If this **isn't verified,** an old, insecure clients,\
  \ vulnerable to process injection could be used to connect to the XPC service even with the other checks in place.\n5. (4\
  \ or 5) Check if the connecting process has hardened runtime without dangerous entitlements (like the ones that allows to\
  \ load arbitrary libraries or use DYLD env vars)\n   1. If this **isn't verified,** the client might be **vulnerable to\
  \ code injection**\n6. Check if the connecting process has an **entitlement** that allows it to connect to the service.\
  \ This is applicable for Apple binaries.\n7. The **verification** must be **based** on the connecting **client’s audit token**\
  \ **instead** of its process ID (**PID**) since the former prevents **PID reuse attacks**.\n   - Developers **rarely use\
  \ the audit token** API call since it’s **private**, so Apple could **change** at any time. Additionally, private API usage\
  \ is not allowed in Mac App Store apps.\n     - If the method **`processIdentifier`** is used, it might be vulnerable\n\
  \     - **`xpc_dictionary_get_audit_token`** should be used instead of **`xpc_connection_get_audit_token`**, as the latest\
  \ could also be [vulnerable in certain situations](https://sector7.computest.nl/post/2023-10-xpc-audit-token-spoofing/).\n\
  \n### Communication Attacks\n\nFor more information about the PID reuse attack check:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nmacos-pid-reuse.md\n\
  {{#endref}}\n\nFor more information **`xpc_connection_get_audit_token`** attack check:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nmacos-xpc_connection_get_audit_token-attack.md\n\
  {{#endref}}\n\n### Trustcache - Downgrade Attacks Prevention\n\nTrustcache is a defensive method introduced in Apple Silicon\
  \ machines that stores a database of CDHSAH of Apple binaries so only allowed non modified binaries can be executed. Which\
  \ prevent the execution of downgrade versions.\n\n### Code Examples\n\nThe server will implement this **verification** in\
  \ a function called **`shouldAcceptNewConnection`**.\n\n```objectivec\n- (BOOL)listener:(NSXPCListener *)listener shouldAcceptNewConnection:(NSXPCConnection\
  \ *)newConnection {\n    //Check connection\n    return YES;\n}\n```\n\nThe object NSXPCConnection has a **private** property\
  \ **`auditToken`** (the one that should be used but could change) and a the **public** property **`processIdentifier`**\
  \ (the one that shouldn't be used).\n\nThe connecting process could be verified with something like:\n\n```objectivec\n\
  [...]\nSecRequirementRef requirementRef = NULL;\nNSString requirementString = @\"anchor apple generic and identifier \\\"\
  xyz.hacktricks.service\\\" and certificate leaf [subject.CN] = \\\"TEAMID\\\" and info [CFBundleShortVersionString] >= \\\
  \"1.0\\\"\";\n/* Check:\n- Signed by a cert signed by Apple\n- Check the bundle ID\n- Check the TEAMID of the signing cert\n\
  - Check the version used\n*/\n\n// Check the requirements with the PID (vulnerable)\nSecRequirementCreateWithString(requirementString,\
  \ kSecCSDefaultFlags, &requirementRef);\nSecCodeCheckValidity(code, kSecCSDefaultFlags, requirementRef);\n\n// Check the\
  \ requirements wuing the auditToken (secure)\nSecTaskRef taskRef = SecTaskCreateWithAuditToken(NULL, ((ExtendedNSXPCConnection*)newConnection).auditToken);\n\
  SecTaskValidateForRequirement(taskRef, (__bridge CFStringRef)(requirementString))\n```\n\nIf a developer doesn't want to\
  \ check the version of the client, he could check that the client is not vulnerable to process injection at least:\n\n```objectivec\n\
  [...]\nCFDictionaryRef csInfo = NULL;\nSecCodeCopySigningInformation(code, kSecCSDynamicInformation, &csInfo);\nuint32_t\
  \ csFlags = [((__bridge NSDictionary *)csInfo)[(__bridge NSString *)kSecCodeInfoStatus] intValue];\nconst uint32_t cs_hard\
  \ = 0x100;        // don't load invalid page.\nconst uint32_t cs_kill = 0x200;        // Kill process if page is invalid\n\
  const uint32_t cs_restrict = 0x800;    // Prevent debugging\nconst uint32_t cs_require_lv = 0x2000; // Library Validation\n\
  const uint32_t cs_runtime = 0x10000;   // hardened runtime\nif ((csFlags & (cs_hard | cs_require_lv)) {\n    return Yes;\
  \ // Accept connection\n}\n```\n\n{{#include ../../../../../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}"
