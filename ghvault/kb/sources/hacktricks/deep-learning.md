  \ of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers (deep neural networks) to model complex patterns in\
  \ data. It has achieved remarkable success in various domains, including computer vision, natural language processing, and\
  \ speech recognition.\n\n### Neural Networks\n\nNeural networks are the building blocks of deep learning. They consist of\
  \ interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers. Each neuron receives inputs, applies a weighted sum, and passes the\
  \ result through an activation function to produce an output. The layers can be categorized as follows:\n- **Input Layer**:\
  \ The first layer that receives the input data.\n- **Hidden Layers**: Intermediate layers that perform transformations on\
  \ the input data. The number of hidden layers and neurons in each layer can vary, leading to different architectures.\n\
  - **Output Layer**: The final layer that produces the output of the network, such as class probabilities in classification\
  \ tasks.\n\n\n### Activation Functions\n\nWhen a layer of neurons processes input data, each neuron applies a weight and\
  \ a bias to the input (`z = w * x + b`), where `w` is the weight, `x` is the input, and `b` is the bias. The output of the\
  \ neuron is then passed through an **activation function to introduce non-linearity** into the model. This activation function\
  \ basically indicates if the next neuron \"should be activated and how much\". This allows the network to learn complex\
  \ patterns and relationships in the data, enabling it to approximate any continuous function.\n\nTherefore, activation functions\
  \ introduce non-linearity into the neural network, allowing it to learn complex relationships in the data. Common activation\
  \ functions include:\n- **Sigmoid**: Maps input values to a range between 0 and 1, often used in binary classification.\n\
  - **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)**: Outputs the input directly if it is positive; otherwise, it outputs zero. It is widely\
  \ used due to its simplicity and effectiveness in training deep networks.\n- **Tanh**: Maps input values to a range between\
  \ -1 and 1, often used in hidden layers.\n- **Softmax**: Converts raw scores into probabilities, often used in the output\
  \ layer for multi-class classification.\n\n### Backpropagation\n\nBackpropagation is the algorithm used to train neural\
  \ networks by adjusting the weights of the connections between neurons. It works by calculating the gradient of the loss\
  \ function with respect to each weight and updating the weights in the opposite direction of the gradient to minimize the\
  \ loss. The steps involved in backpropagation are:\n\n1. **Forward Pass**: Compute the output of the network by passing\
  \ the input through the layers and applying activation functions.\n2. **Loss Calculation**: Calculate the loss (error) between\
  \ the predicted output and the true target using a loss function (e.g., mean squared error for regression, cross-entropy\
  \ for classification).\n3. **Backward Pass**: Compute the gradients of the loss with respect to each weight using the chain\
  \ rule of calculus.\n4. **Weight Update**: Update the weights using an optimization algorithm (e.g., stochastic gradient\
  \ descent, Adam) to minimize the loss.\n\n## Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)\n\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)\
  \ are a specialized type of neural network designed for processing grid-like data, such as images. They are particularly\
  \ effective in computer vision tasks due to their ability to automatically learn spatial hierarchies of features.\n\nThe\
  \ main components of CNNs include:\n- **Convolutional Layers**: Apply convolution operations to the input data using learnable\
  \ filters (kernels) to extract local features. Each filter slides over the input and computes a dot product, producing a\
  \ feature map.\n- **Pooling Layers**: Downsample the feature maps to reduce their spatial dimensions while retaining important\
  \ features. Common pooling operations include max pooling and average pooling.\n- **Fully Connected Layers**: Connect every\
  \ neuron in one layer to every neuron in the next layer, similar to traditional neural networks. These layers are typically\
  \ used at the end of the network for classification tasks.\n\nInside a CNN **`Convolutional Layers`**, we can also distinguish\
  \ between:\n- **Initial Convolutional Layer**: The first convolutional layer that processes the raw input data (e.g., an\
  \ image) and is useful to identify basic features like edges and textures.\n- **Intermediate Convolutional Layers**: Subsequent\
  \ convolutional layers that build on the features learned by the initial layer, allowing the network to learn more complex\
  \ patterns and representations.\n- **Final Convolutional Layer**: The last convolutional layers before the fully connected\
  \ layers, which captures high-level features and prepares the data for classification.\n\n> [!TIP]\n> CNNs are particularly\
  \ effective for image classification, object detection, and image segmentation tasks due to their ability to learn spatial\
  \ hierarchies of features in grid-like data and reduce the number of parameters through weight sharing.\n> Moreover, they\
  \ work better with data supporting the feature locality principle where neighboring data (pixels) are more likely to be\
  \ related than distant pixels, which might not be the case for other types of data like text.\n> Furthermore, note how CNNs\
  \ will be able to identify even complex features but won't be able to apply any spatial context, meaning that the same feature\
  \ found in different parts of the image will be the same.\n\n### Example defining a CNN\n\n*Here you will find a description\
  \ on how to define a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in PyTorch that starts with a batch of RGB images as dataset of\
  \ size 48x48 and uses convolutional layers and maxpool to extract features, followed by fully connected layers for classification.*\n\
  \nThis is how you can define 1 convolutional layer in PyTorch: `self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(in_channels=3, out_channels=32, kernel_size=3,\
  \ padding=1)`.\n\n- `in_channels`: Number of input channels. In case of RGB images, this is 3 (one for each color channel).\
  \ If you are working with grayscale images, this would be 1.\n\n- `out_channels`: Number of output channels (filters) that\
  \ the convolutional layer will learn. This is a hyperparameter that you can adjust based on your model architecture.\n\n\
  - `kernel_size`: Size of the convolutional filter. A common choice is 3x3, which means the filter will cover a 3x3 area\
  \ of the input image. This is like a 3×3×3 colour stamp that is used to generate the out_channels from the in_channels:\n\
  \  1. Place that 3×3×3 stamp on the top-left corner of the image cube.\n  2. Multiply every weight by the pixel under it,\
  \ add them all, add bias → you get one number.\n  3. Write that number into a blank map at position (0, 0).\n  4. Slide\
  \ the stamp one pixel to the right (stride = 1) and repeat until you fill a whole 48×48 grid.\n\n- `padding`: Number of\
  \ pixels added to each side of the input. Padding helps preserve the spatial dimensions of the input, allowing for more\
  \ control over the output size. For example, with a 3x3 kernel an 48x48 pixel input, padding of 1 will keep the output size\
  \ the same (48x48) after the convolution operation. This is because the padding adds a border of 1 pixel around the input\
  \ image, allowing the kernel to slide over the edges without reducing the spatial dimensions.\n\nThen, the number of trainable\
  \ parameters in this layer is:\n- (3x3x3 (kernel size) + 1 (bias)) x 32 (out_channels) = 896 trainable parameters.\n\nNote\
  \ that a Bias (+1) is added per kernel used because the function of each convolutional layer is to learn a linear transformation\
  \ of the input, which is represented by the equation:\n\n```plaintext\nY = f(W * X + b)\n```\n\nwhere the `W` is the weight\
  \ matrix (the learned filters, 3x3x3 = 27 params), `b` is the bias vector which is +1 for each output channel.\n\nNote that\
  \ the output of `self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(in_channels=3, out_channels=32, kernel_size=3, padding=1)` will be a tensor of shape\
  \ `(batch_size, 32, 48, 48)`, because 32 is the new number of generated channels of size 48x48 pixels.\n\nThen, we could\
  \ connect this convolutional layer to another convolutional layer like: `self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(in_channels=32, out_channels=64,\
  \ kernel_size=3, padding=1)`.\n\nWhich will add: (32x3x3 (kernel size) + 1 (bias)) x 64 (out_channels) = 18,496 trainable\
  \ parameters and an output of shape `(batch_size, 64, 48, 48)`.\n\nAs you can see the **number of parameters grows quickly\
  \ with each additional convolutional layer**, especially as the number of output channels increases.\n\nOne option to control\
  \ the amount of data used is to use **max pooling** after each convolutional layer. Max pooling reduces the spatial dimensions\
  \ of the feature maps, which helps to reduce the number of parameters and computational complexity while retaining important\
  \ features.\n\nIt can be declared as: `self.pool1 = nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2)`. This basically indicates to\
  \ use a grid of 2x2 pixels and take the maximum value from each grid to reduce the size of the feature map by half. Morever,\
  \ `stride=2` means that the pooling operation will move 2 pixels at a time, in this case, preventing any overlap between\
  \ the pooling regions.\n\nWith this pooling layer, the output shape after the first convolutional layer would be `(batch_size,\
  \ 64, 24, 24)` after applying `self.pool1` to the output of `self.conv2`, reducing the size to 1/4th of the previous layer.\n\
  \n> [!TIP]\n> It's important to pool after the convolutional layers to reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps,\
  \ which helps to control the number of parameters and computational complexity while making the initial parameter learn\
  \ important features.\n>You can see the convolutions before a pooling layer as a way to extract features from the input\
  \ data (like lines, edges), this information will still be present in the pooled output, but the next convolutional layer\
  \ will not be able to see the original input data, only the pooled output, which is a reduced version of the previous layer\
  \ with that information.\n>In the usual order: `Conv → ReLU → Pool` each 2×2 pooling window now contends with feature activations\
  \ (“edge present / not”), not raw pixel intensities. Keeping the strongest activation really does keep the most salient\
  \ evidence.\n\nThen, after adding as many convolutional and pooling layers as needed, we can flatten the output to feed\
  \ it into fully connected layers. This is done by reshaping the tensor to a 1D vector for each sample in the batch:\n\n\
  ```python\nx = x.view(-1, 64*24*24)\n```\n\nAnd with this 1D vector with all the training parameters generated by the previous\
  \ convolutional and pooling layers, we can define a fully connected layer like:\n\n```python\nself.fc1 = nn.Linear(64 *\
  \ 24 * 24, 512)\n```\n\nWhich will take the flattened output of the previous layer and map it to 512 hidden units.\n\nNote\
  \ how this layer added `(64 * 24 * 24 + 1 (bias)) * 512 = 3,221,504` trainable parameters, which is a significant increase\
  \ compared to the convolutional layers. This is because fully connected layers connect every neuron in one layer to every\
  \ neuron in the next layer, leading to a large number of parameters.\n\nFinally, we can add an output layer to produce the\
  \ final class logits:\n\n```python\nself.fc2 = nn.Linear(512, num_classes)\n```\n\nThis will add `(512 + 1 (bias)) * num_classes`\
  \ trainable parameters, where `num_classes` is the number of classes in the classification task (e.g., 43 for the GTSRB\
  \ dataset).\n\nOne alst common practice is to add a dropout layer before the fully connected layers to prevent overfitting.\
  \ This can be done with:\n\n```python\nself.dropout = nn.Dropout(0.5)\n```\nThis layer randomly sets a fraction of the input\
  \ units to zero during training, which helps to prevent overfitting by reducing the reliance on specific neurons.\n\n###\

  \ defined above. Some interesting values to note:\n\n- `EPOCHS` is the number of times the model will see the entire dataset\
  \ during training. If EPOCH is too small, the model may not learn enough; if too large, it may overfit.\n- `LEARNING_RATE`\
  \ is the step size for the optimizer. A small learning rate may lead to slow convergence, while a large one may overshoot\
  \ the optimal solution and prevent convergence.\n- `WEIGHT_DECAY` is a regularization term that helps prevent overfitting\
  \ by penalizing large weights.\n\nRegarding the training loop this is some interesting information to know:\n- The `criterion\
  \ = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()` is the loss function used for multi-class classification tasks. It combines softmax activation\
  \ and cross-entropy loss in a single function, making it suitable for training models that output class logits.\n    - If\
  \ the model was expected to output other types of outputs, like binary classification or regression, we would use different\
  \ loss functions like `nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss()` for binary classification or `nn.MSELoss()` for regression.\n- The `optimizer\
  \ = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=LEARNING_RATE, weight_decay=WEIGHT_DECAY)` initializes the Adam optimizer, which is\
  \ a popular choice for training deep learning models. It adapts the learning rate for each parameter based on the first\
  \ and second moments of the gradients.\n    - Other optimizers like `optim.SGD` (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or `optim.RMSprop`\
  \ could also be used, depending on the specific requirements of the training task.\n- The `model.train()` method sets the\
  \ model to training mode, enabling layers like dropout and batch normalization to behave differently during training compared\
  \ to evaluation.\n- `optimizer.zero_grad()` clears the gradients of all optimized tensors before the backward pass, which\
  \ is necessary because gradients accumulate by default in PyTorch. If not cleared, gradients from previous iterations would\
  \ be added to the current gradients, leading to incorrect updates.\n- `loss.backward()` computes the gradients of the loss\
  \ with respect to the model parameters, which are then used by the optimizer to update the weights.\n- `optimizer.step()`\
  \ updates the model parameters based on the computed gradients and the learning rate.\n\n```python\nimport torch, torch.nn.functional\

  \nRecurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a class of neural networks designed for processing sequential data, such as time\
  \ series or natural language. Unlike traditional feedforward neural networks, RNNs have connections that loop back on themselves,\
  \ allowing them to maintain a hidden state that captures information about previous inputs in the sequence.\n\nThe main\
  \ components of RNNs include:\n- **Recurrent Layers**: These layers process input sequences one time step at a time, updating\
  \ their hidden state based on the current input and the previous hidden state. This allows RNNs to learn temporal dependencies\
  \ in the data.\n- **Hidden State**: The hidden state is a vector that summarizes the information from previous time steps.\
  \ It is updated at each time step and is used to make predictions for the current input.\n- **Output Layer**: The output\
  \ layer produces the final predictions based on the hidden state. In many cases, RNNs are used for tasks like language modeling,\
  \ where the output is a probability distribution over the next word in a sequence.\n\nFor example, in a language model,\
  \ the RNN processes a sequence of words, for example, \"The cat sat on the\" and predicts the next word based on the context\
  \ provided by the previous words, in this case, \"mat\".\n\n### Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)\n\
  \nRNNs are particularly effective for tasks involving sequential data, such as language modeling, machine translation, and\
  \ speech recognition. However, they can struggle with **long-range dependencies due to issues like vanishing gradients**.\n\
  \nTo address this, specialized architectures like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) were developed.\
  \ These architectures introduce gating mechanisms that control the flow of information, allowing them to capture long-range\
  \ dependencies more effectively.\n\n- **LSTM**: LSTM networks use three gates (input gate, forget gate, and output gate)\
  \ to regulate the flow of information in and out of the cell state, enabling them to remember or forget information over\
  \ long sequences. The input gate controls how much new information to add based on the input and the previous hidden state,\
  \ the forget gate controls how much information to discard. Combining the input gate and the forget gate we get the new\
  \ state. Finally, combining the new cell state, with the input and the previous hidden state we also get the new hidden\
  \ state.\n- **GRU**: GRU networks simplify the LSTM architecture by combining the input and forget gates into a single update\
  \ gate, making them computationally more efficient while still capturing long-range dependencies.\n\n## LLMs (Large Language\
  \ Models)\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) are a type of deep learning model specifically designed for natural language processing\
  \ tasks. They are trained on vast amounts of text data and can generate human-like text, answer questions, translate languages,\
  \ and perform various other language-related tasks.\nLLMs are typically based on transformer architectures, which use self-attention\
  \ mechanisms to capture relationships between words in a sequence, allowing them to understand context and generate coherent\
  \ text.\n\n### Transformer Architecture\nThe transformer architecture is the foundation of many LLMs. It consists of an\
  \ encoder-decoder structure, where the encoder processes the input sequence and the decoder generates the output sequence.\
  \ The key components of the transformer architecture include:\n- **Self-Attention Mechanism**: This mechanism allows the\
  \ model to weigh the importance of different words in a sequence when generating representations. It computes attention\
  \ scores based on the relationships between words, enabling the model to focus on relevant context.\n- **Multi-Head Attention**:\
  \ This component allows the model to capture multiple relationships between words by using multiple attention heads, each\
  \ focusing on different aspects of the input.\n- **Positional Encoding**: Since transformers do not have a built-in notion\
  \ of word order, positional encoding is added to the input embeddings to provide information about the position of words\
  \ in the sequence.\n\n## Diffusion Models\nDiffusion models are a class of generative models that learn to generate data\
  \ by simulating a diffusion process. They are particularly effective for tasks like image generation and have gained popularity\
  \ in recent years.\nDiffusion models work by gradually transforming a simple noise distribution into a complex data distribution\
  \ through a series of diffusion steps. The key components of diffusion models include:\n- **Forward Diffusion Process**:\
  \ This process gradually adds noise to the data, transforming it into a simple noise distribution. The forward diffusion\
  \ process is typically defined by a series of noise levels, where each level corresponds to a specific amount of noise added\
  \ to the data.\n- **Reverse Diffusion Process**: This process learns to reverse the forward diffusion process, gradually\
  \ denoising the data to generate samples from the target distribution. The reverse diffusion process is trained using a\
  \ loss function that encourages the model to reconstruct the original data from noisy samples.\n\nMoreover, to generate\
  \ an image from a text prompt, diffusion models typically follow these steps:\n1. **Text Encoding**: The text prompt is\
  \ encoded into a latent representation using a text encoder (e.g., a transformer-based model). This representation captures\
  \ the semantic meaning of the text.\n2. **Noise Sampling**: A random noise vector is sampled from a Gaussian distribution.\n\
  3. **Diffusion Steps**: The model applies a series of diffusion steps, gradually transforming the noise vector into an image\
  \ that corresponds to the text prompt. Each step involves applying learned transformations to denoise the image.\n\n\n{{#include\
