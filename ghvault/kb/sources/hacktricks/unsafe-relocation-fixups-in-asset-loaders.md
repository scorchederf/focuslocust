_body: "# Unsafe Relocation Fixups in Asset Loaders\n\n{{#include ../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n## Why asset relocations\
  \ matter\n\nMany legacy game engines (Granny 3D, Gamebryo, etc.) load complex assets by:\n\n1. Parsing a header and section\
  \ table.\n2. Allocating one heap buffer per section.\n3. Building a `SectionArray` that stores the base pointer of every\
  \ section.\n4. Applying relocation tables so that pointers embedded inside the section data get patched to the right target\
  \ section + offset.\n\nWhen the relocation handler blindly trusts attacker-controlled metadata, every relocation becomes\
  \ a potential arbitrary read/write primitive. In *Anno 1404: Venice*, `granny2.dll` ships the following helper:\n\n<details>\n\
  <summary>`GrannyGRNFixUp_0` (trimmed)</summary>\n\n```c\nint *__cdecl GrannyGRNFixUp_0(DWORD RelocationCount,\n        \
  \                       Relocation *PointerFixupArray,\n                               int *SectionArray,\n            \
  \                   char *destination)\n{\n  while (RelocationCount--) {\n    int target_base = SectionArray[PointerFixupArray->SectionNumber];\
  \ // unchecked index\n    int *patch_site = (int *)(destination + PointerFixupArray->SectionOffset); // unchecked offset\n\
  \    *patch_site = target_base ;\n    if (target_base)\n      *patch_site = target_base + PointerFixupArray->Offset;\n \
  \   ++PointerFixupArray;\n  }\n  return SectionArray;\n}\n```\n\n</details>\n\n`SectionNumber` is never range-checked and\
  \ `SectionOffset` is never validated against the current section size. Crafting relocation entries with negative offsets\
  \ or oversized indices lets you walk outside the section you control and stomp allocator metadata such as the section pointer\
  \ array itself.\n\n## Stage 1 – Writing backwards into loader metadata\n\nThe goal is to make the relocation table of **section\
  \ 0** overwrite entries of `SectionContentArray` (which mirrors `SectionArray` and is stored right before the first section\
  \ buffer). Because Granny’s custom allocator prepends **0x1F** bytes and the NT heap adds its own **0x10**-byte header plus\
  \ alignment, an attacker can precalculate the distance between the start of the first section (`destination`) and the section-pointer\
  \ array.\n\nIn the tested build, forcing the loader to allocate a `GrannyFile` structure that is exactly **0x4000 bytes**\
  \ makes the section-pointer arrays land right before the first section buffer. Solving\n\n```\n0x20 (header) + 0x20 (section\
  \ descriptors)\n+ n * 1 (section types) + n * 1 (flags)\n+ n * 4 (pointer table) = 0x4000\n```\n\ngives **n = 2720** sections.\
  \ A relocation entry with `SectionOffset = -0x3FF0` ( `0x4000 - 0x20 - 0x20 + 0x30` ) now resolves to `SectionContentArray[1]`\
  \ even though the destination section thinks it is patching internal pointers.\n\n## Stage 2 – Deterministic heap layout\
  \ on Windows 10\n\nWindows 10 NT Heap routes allocations **≤ RtlpLargestLfhBlock (0x4000)** to the randomized LFH and larger\
  \ ones to the deterministic backend allocator. By keeping the `GrannyFile` metadata slightly above that threshold (using\
  \ the 2720 sections trick) and preloading several malicious `.gr2` assets, you can make:\n\n- Allocation #1 (metadata +\
  \ section pointer arrays) land in a >0x4000 backend chunk.\n- Allocation #2 (section 0 contents) land immediately after\
  \ allocation #1.\n- Allocation #3 (section 1 contents) land right after allocation #2, giving you a predictable target for\
  \ subsequent relocations.\n\nProcess Monitor confirmed that assets are streamed on demand, so repeatedly requesting crafted\
  \ units/buildings is enough to “prime” the heap layout without touching the executable image.\n\n## Stage 3 – Converting\
  \ the primitive into RCE\n\n1. **Corrupt `SectionContentArray[1]`.** Section 0’s relocation table overwrites it by using\
  \ the `-0x3FF0` offset. Point it at any writable region you control (e.g., later section data).\n2. **Recycle the corrupted\
  \ pointer.** Section 1’s relocation table now treats `SectionNumber = 1` as whatever pointer you injected. The handler writes\
  \ `SectionArray[1] + Offset` to `destination + SectionOffset`, giving you an arbitrary 4-byte write for every relocation\
  \ entry.\n3. **Hit reliable dispatchers.** In Anno 1404 the target of choice was the `granny2.dll` allocator callbacks (no\
  \ ASLR, DEP disabled). Overwriting the function pointer that `granny2.dll` uses for the next `Malloc`/`Free` call immediately\
  \ diverts execution to attacker-controlled code loaded from the trojanized asset.\n\nBecause both `granny2.dll` and the\
  \ injected `.gr2` buffers reside at stable addresses when ASLR/DEP are disabled, the attack reduces to building a small\
  \ ROP chain or raw shellcode and pointing the callback at it.\n\n## Practical checklist\n\n- Look for asset loaders that\
  \ maintain `SectionArray` / relocation tables.\n- Diff relocation handlers for missing bounds on indices/offsets.\n- Measure\
  \ the allocator headers added by both the game’s allocator wrapper and the underlying OS heap to compute backwards offsets\
  \ precisely.\n- Force deterministic placement by:\n  - inflating metadata (many empty sections) until allocation size >\
  \ `RtlpLargestLfhBlock`;\n  - repeatedly loading the malicious asset to fill backend holes.\n- Use a two-stage relocation\
  \ table (first to retarget `SectionArray`, second to spray writes) and overwrite function pointers that will fire during\
  \ normal rendering (allocator callbacks, virtual tables, animation dispatchers, etc.).\n\nOnce you gain an arbitrary file\
  \ write (e.g., via the path traversal in the multiplayer save transfer), repackaging RDA archives with the crafted `.gr2`\
  \ gives you a clean delivery vector that is automatically decompressed by remote clients.\n\n## References\n\n- [Synacktiv\
