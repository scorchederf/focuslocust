  \ **core of macOS is XNU**, which stands for \"X is Not Unix\". This kernel is fundamentally composed of the **Mach microkerne**l\
  \ (to be discussed later), **and** elements from Berkeley Software Distribution (**BSD**). XNU also provides a platform\
  \ for **kernel drivers via a system called the I/O Kit**. The XNU kernel is part of the Darwin open source project, which\
  \ means **its source code is freely accessible**.\n\nFrom a perspective of a security researcher or a Unix developer, **macOS**\
  \ can feel quite **similar** to a **FreeBSD** system with an elegant GUI and a host of custom applications. Most applications\
  \ developed for BSD will compile and run on macOS without needing modifications, as the command-line tools familiar to Unix\
  \ users are all present in macOS. However, because the XNU kernel incorporates Mach, there are some significant differences\
  \ between a traditional Unix-like system and macOS, and these differences might cause potential issues or provide unique\
  \ advantages.\n\nOpen source version of XNU: [https://opensource.apple.com/source/xnu/](https://opensource.apple.com/source/xnu/)\n\
  \n### Mach\n\nMach is a **microkernel** designed to be **UNIX-compatible**. One of its key design principles was to **minimize**\
  \ the amount of **code** running in the **kernel** space and instead allow many typical kernel functions, such as file system,\
  \ networking, and I/O, to **run as user-level tasks**.\n\nIn XNU, Mach is **responsible for many of the critical low-level\
  \ operations** a kernel typically handles, such as processor scheduling, multitasking, and virtual memory management.\n\n\
  ### BSD\n\nThe XNU **kernel** also **incorporates** a significant amount of code derived from the **FreeBSD** project. This\
  \ code **runs as part of the kernel along with Mach**, in the same address space. However, the FreeBSD code within XNU may\
  \ differ substantially from the original FreeBSD code because modifications were required to ensure its compatibility with\
  \ Mach. FreeBSD contributes to many kernel operations including:\n\n- Process management\n- Signal handling\n- Basic security\
  \ mechanisms, including user and group management\n- System call infrastructure\n- TCP/IP stack and sockets\n- Firewall\
  \ and packet filtering\n\nUnderstanding the interaction between BSD and Mach can be complex, due to their different conceptual\
  \ frameworks. For instance, BSD uses processes as its fundamental executing unit, while Mach operates based on threads.\
  \ This discrepancy is reconciled in XNU by **associating each BSD process with a Mach task** that contains exactly one Mach\
  \ thread. When BSD's fork() system call is used, the BSD code within the kernel uses Mach functions to create a task and\
  \ a thread structure.\n\nMoreover, **Mach and BSD each maintain different security models**: **Mach's** security model is\
  \ based on **port rights**, whereas BSD's security model operates based on **process ownership**. Disparities between these\
  \ two models have occasionally resulted in local privilege-escalation vulnerabilities. Apart from typical system calls,\
  \ there are also **Mach traps that allow user-space programs to interact with the kernel**. These different elements together\
  \ form the multifaceted, hybrid architecture of the macOS kernel.\n\n### I/O Kit - Drivers\n\nThe I/O Kit is an open-source,\
  \ object-oriented **device-driver framework** in the XNU kernel, handles **dynamically loaded device drivers**. It allows\
  \ modular code to be added to the kernel on-the-fly, supporting diverse hardware.\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nmacos-iokit.md\n{{#endref}}\n\
  \n### Coprocessors in macOS Architecture\n\nApple platforms rely on several coprocessors to keep latency-sensitive work\
  \ off the main cores and to isolate security-critical functions.\n\n- **Secure Enclave Processor (SEP)**: A dedicated ARM\
  \ core with its own microkernel and secure boot chain, typically running at **EL3/secure world**. Interaction happens through\
  \ mailbox drivers in macOS at EL1.\n  - Attack surface: SEP firmware updates and the user-space daemons (`seputil`, `securityd`)\
  \ that proxy requests.\n  - Impact of compromise: Leak long-term keys, bypass biometric gating, and break FileVault or Apple\
  \ Pay protections.\n- **System Management Controller (SMC)**: Runs proprietary firmware on a microcontroller outside the\
  \ ARM exception levels. macOS (EL1) reaches it via I/O Kit user clients.\n  - Attack surface: USB-C power delivery messages,\
  \ fan/battery management interfaces, and firmware update paths.\n  - Impact of compromise: Override thermal limits, inject\
  \ fake sensor data, cut power, or implant persistent NVRAM backdoors.\n- **T1/T2 Security Chips**: Run bridgeOS (watchOS-derived)\
  \ largely at EL1/EL3 on their own ARM cores. macOS communicates over PCIe/USB-like channels mediated by IOKit.\n  - Attack\
  \ surface: DFU/restore pathways, IPC endpoints exposed by services like `tccd`, and media pipelines bridged to the T2.\n\
  \  - Impact of compromise: Disable secure boot, decrypt SSD contents, hijack camera/mic gating, or emulate HID input for\
  \ stealth persistence.\n- **Display Coprocessor (DCP)**: Executes firmware at EL1 inside an isolated address space protected\
  \ by DART (Apple’s IOMMU).\n  - Attack surface: `DCPAVService` interfaces, shared descriptor buffers, and firmware image\
  \ parsing.\n  - Impact of compromise: Inject arbitrary frames, snoop framebuffers, or brick the display pipeline for DoS.\n\
  - **Apple Neural Engine (ANE)**: Runs microcode on a dedicated ML cluster (no ARM EL levels). macOS schedules work via `ANECompilerService`\
  \ and IOKit.\n  - Attack surface: Compiled model binaries (`.ane`), Core ML APIs feeding custom kernels, and firmware loaders.\n\
  \  - Impact of compromise: Tamper or exfiltrate ML models, leak processed audio/vision data, or sabotage on-device inference.\n\
  - **AGX GPU**: Firmware runs on custom GPU cores with a scheduler; EL0 submits Metal commands that EL1 validates.\n  - Attack\
  \ surface: Metal shader compiler, shared buffer mapping APIs, and `com.apple.AGXFirmware` ioctl interfaces.\n  - Impact\
  \ of compromise: DMA access to system memory, sandbox escapes via GPU drivers, or persistent firmware implants.\n- **Apple\
  \ Video Encoder (AVE)**: Firmware executes on the Media Engine in an EL1-like sandbox. macOS interacts via VideoToolbox\
  \ and `AppleAVE2`.\n  - Attack surface: Codec bitstreams, parameter sets, user-supplied buffers, and firmware update blobs.\n\
  \  - Impact of compromise: Leak uncompressed frames, bypass DRM, or gain code execution with access to DMA engines.\n- **Image\
  \ Signal Processor (ISP)**: Runs secure firmware in the Media Engine cluster; macOS camera drivers operate at EL1.\n  -\
  \ Attack surface: Camera HALs, RAW frame descriptors, ISP configuration queues, and firmware updates.\n  - Impact of compromise:\
  \ Capture raw camera feeds silently, disable privacy indicators, or inject fabricated imagery.\n- **AMX Matrix cores**:\
  \ Operate as coprocessor units exposed at EL0/EL1 via new instructions.\n  - Attack surface: Kernel virtualization of AMX\
  \ state (`thread_set_state`, context switches) and user-space code generation.\n  - Impact of compromise: Leak other processes’\
  \ tile registers, fingerprint workloads, or escalate via kernel memory corruption.\n\nModern macOS treats these coprocessors\
  \ as trusted components in the chain of trust. Firmware for SEP, SMC, and T2 is signed by Apple, and handshake protocols\
  \ (often implemented over mailboxes or I/O Kit families) include challenge-response checks so that only authenticated firmware\
  \ can service requests.\n\n### IPC - Inter Process Communication\n\n{{#ref}}\n../macos-proces-abuse/macos-ipc-inter-process-communication/\n\
  {{#endref}}\n\n## macOS Kernel Extensions\n\nmacOS is **super restrictive to load Kernel Extensions** (.kext) because of\
  \ the high privileges that code will run with. Actually, by default is virtually impossible (unless a bypass is found).\n\
  \nIn the following page you can also see how to recover the `.kext` that macOS loads inside its **kernelcache**:\n\n{{#ref}}\n\
  macos-kernel-extensions.md\n{{#endref}}\n\n### macOS System Extensions\n\nInstead of using Kernel Extensions macOS created\
  \ the System Extensions, which offers in user level APIs to interact with the kernel. This way, developers can avoid to\
  \ use kernel extensions.\n\n{{#ref}}\nmacos-system-extensions.md\n{{#endref}}\n\n\n### Cryptexes & RSR (Rapid Security Response)\n\
  \n- **Cryptex** stands for **CRYPTographically-sealed EXtension**. It is a sealed disk image (container) used by Apple to\
  \ host parts of the OS (frameworks, shared libraries, apps) that are more likely to change between major OS updates. \n\
  - On macOS and iOS, components placed inside cryptexes can be **patched or replaced** via RSR without re-sealing the entire\
  \ system volume. \n- Cryptexes reside on the **Preboot volume**, alongside boot firmware, and are grafted into the OS file\
  \ system at runtime. \n- Loading cryptex content involves validation: the system checks file seals, manifests, and root\
  \ hashes, then mounts or “grafts” the cryptex content so that at runtime apps use the cryptex versions where present. \n\
  - In boot logs, cryptex loading happens after kernel initialization but before full system services are up. \n\n\n#### Rapid\
  \ Security Response (RSR)\n\n- **RSR** is Apple’s mechanism for delivering **security patches between regular OS updates**.\
  \ It targets cryptex content to update vulnerable parts (e.g. libraries, frameworks) without touching the core system volume.\
  \ \n- When applying an RSR update, the device requests from Apple’s signing server a **Cryptex1 Image4 manifest**. This\
  \ manifest is cryptographically bound to the device and to the new cryptex content. \n- The existing AP boot ticket for\
  \ the base system **is not modified** by RSR. The patch works additively over the sealed base OS. \n- On macOS, certain\
  \ patched components (e.g. Safari) become active as soon as the app relaunches; a full system restart is not always required.\
  \ \n- RSRs are **removable**: each ships both a patch and an “antipatch” that can roll back to the base OS version. On removal,\
  \ cryptex content is reverted. \n- RSR updates are generally much smaller than full OS updates, and require lower battery\
  \ state to install. \n\n\n## References\n\n- [**The Mac Hacker's Handbook**](https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Charlie-Miller-ebook-dp-B004U7MUMU/dp/B004U7MUMU/ref=mt_other?_encoding=UTF8&me=&qid=)\n\
