_body: "# Cobalt Strike\n\n{{#include ../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n### Listeners\n\n### C2 Listeners\n\n`Cobalt\
  \ Strike -> Listeners -> Add/Edit` then you can select where to listen, which kind of beacon to use (http, dns, smb...)\
  \ and more.\n\n### Peer2Peer Listeners\n\nThe beacons of these listeners don't need to talk to the C2 directly, they can\
  \ communicate to it through other beacons.\n\n`Cobalt Strike -> Listeners -> Add/Edit` then you need to select the TCP or\
  \ SMB beacons\n\n* The **TCP beacon will set a listener in the port selected**. To connect to a TCP beacon use the command\
  \ `connect <ip> <port>` from another beacon\n* The **smb beacon will listen in a pipename with the selected name**. To connect\
  \ to a SMB beacon you need to use the command `link [target] [pipe]`.\n\n### Generate & Host payloads\n\n#### Generate payloads\
  \ in files\n\n`Attacks -> Packages ->`\n\n* **`HTMLApplication`** for HTA files\n* **`MS Office Macro`** for an office document\
  \ with a macro\n* **`Windows Executable`** for a .exe, .dll orr service .exe\n* **`Windows Executable (S)`** for a **stageless**\
  \ .exe, .dll or service .exe (better stageless than staged, less IoCs)\n\n#### Generate & Host payloads\n\n`Attacks -> Web\
  \ Drive-by -> Scripted Web Delivery (S)` This will generate a script/executable to download the beacon from cobalt strike\
  \ in formats such as: bitsadmin, exe, powershell and python\n\n#### Host Payloads\n\nIf you already has the file you want\
  \ to host in a web sever just go to `Attacks -> Web Drive-by -> Host File` and select the file to host and web server config.\n\

  \ Cobalt Strike Team Server HTTP/S protocol (default malleable C2 profile) to register/check-in and receive tasks. Implement\
  \ the same URIs/headers/metadata crypto defined in the profile to reuse the Cobalt Strike UI for tasking and output.\n-\
  \ An Aggressor Script (e.g., `CustomBeacon.cna`) can wrap payload generation for the non-Windows beacon so operators can\
  \ select the listener and produce ELF payloads directly from the GUI.\n- Example Linux task handlers exposed to the Team\
  \ Server: `sleep`, `cd`, `pwd`, `shell` (exec arbitrary commands), `ls`, `upload`, `download`, and `exit`. These map to\
  \ task IDs expected by the Team Server and must be implemented server-side to return output in the proper format.\n- BOF\
  \ support on Linux can be added by loading Beacon Object Files in-process with [TrustedSec's ELFLoader](https://github.com/trustedsec/ELFLoader)\
  \ (supports Outflank-style BOFs too), allowing modular post-exploitation to run inside the implant's context/privileges\
  \ without spawning new processes.\n- Embed a SOCKS handler in the custom beacon to keep pivoting parity with Windows Beacons:\
  \ when the operator runs `socks <port>` the implant should open a local proxy to route operator tooling through the compromised\
  \ Linux host into internal networks.\n\n## Opsec\n\n### Execute-Assembly\n\nThe **`execute-assembly`** uses a **sacrificial\
  \ process** using remote process injection to execute the indicated program. This is very noisy as to inject inside a process\
  \ certain Win APIs are used that every EDR is checking. However, there are some custom tools that can be used to load something\
  \ in the same process:\n\n- [https://github.com/anthemtotheego/InlineExecute-Assembly](https://github.com/anthemtotheego/InlineExecute-Assembly)\n\
  - [https://github.com/kyleavery/inject-assembly](https://github.com/kyleavery/inject-assembly)\n- In Cobalt Strike you can\
  \ also use BOF (Beacon Object Files): [https://github.com/CCob/BOF.NET](https://github.com/CCob/BOF.NET)\n\nThe agressor\
  \ script `https://github.com/outflanknl/HelpColor` will create the `helpx` command in Cobalt Strike which will put colors\
  \ in commands indicating if they are BOFs (green), if they are Frok&Run (yellow) and similar, or if they are ProcessExecution,\
  \ injection or similar (red). Which helps to know which commands are more stealthy.\n\n### Act as the user\n\nYou could\
  \ check events like `Seatbelt.exe LogonEvents ExplicitLogonEvents PoweredOnEvents`: \n\n- Security EID 4624 - Check all\
  \ the interactive logons to know the usual operating hours.\n- System EID 12,13 - Check the shutdown/startup/sleep frequency.\n\
  - Security EID 4624/4625 - Check inbound valid/invalid NTLM attempts.\n- Security EID 4648 - This event is created when\
  \ plaintext credentials are used to logon. If a process generated it, the binary potentially has the credentials in clear\
  \ text ina  config file or inside the code.\n\nWhen using `jump` from cobalt strike, it's better to use the `wmi_msbuild`\
  \ method to make the new process look more legit.\n\n### Use computer accounts\n\nIt's common for defenders to be checking\
  \ weird behaviours generated from users abd **exclude service accounts and computer accounts like `*$` from their monitoring**.\
  \ You could use these accounts to perform lateral movement or privilege escalation.\n\n### Use stageless payloads\n\nStageless\
  \ payloads are less noisy than staged ones because they don't need to download a second stage from the C2 server. This means\
  \ that they don't generate any network traffic after the initial connection, making them less likely to be detected by network-based\
  \ defenses.\n\n### Tokens & Token Store\n\nBe careful when you steal or generate tokens because it might be posisble for\
  \ an EDR to enumerate all the tokens of all the threads and find a **token belonging to a different user** or even SYSTEM\
  \ in the process.\n\nThis allows to store tokens **per beacon** so it's not needed to steal the same token again and again.\
  \ This is useful for lateral movement or when you need to use a stolen token multiple times:\n\n- token-store steal <pid>\n\
  - token-store steal-and-use <pid>\n- token-store show\n- token-store use <id>\n- token-store remove <id>\n- token-store\
  \ remove-all\n\nWhen moving laterally, usually is better to **steal a token than to generate a new one** or perform a pass\
  \ the hash attack.\n\n### Guardrails\n\nCobalt Strike has a feature called **Guardrails** that helps to prevent the use\
  \ of certain commands or actions that could be detected by defenders. Guardrails can be configured to block specific commands,\
  \ such as `make_token`, `jump`, `remote-exec`, and others that are commonly used for lateral movement or privilege escalation.\n\
  \nMoreover, the repo [https://github.com/Arvanaghi/CheckPlease/wiki/System-Related-Checks](https://github.com/Arvanaghi/CheckPlease/wiki/System-Related-Checks)\
  \ also contains some checks and ideas you could consider before executing a payload.\n\n### Tickets encryption\n\nIn an\
  \ AD be careful with the encryption of the tickets. By default, some tools will use RC4 encryption for Kerberos tickets,\
  \ which is less secure than AES encryption and by default up to date environments will use AES. This can be detected by\
  \ defenders who are monitoring for weak encryption algorithms.\n\n### Avoid Defaults\n\nWhen using Cobalt Stricke by default\
  \ the SMB pipes will have the name `msagent_####` and `\"status_####`. Change those names. It's possible to check the names\
  \ of the existing pipes from Cobal Strike with the command: `ls \\\\.\\pipe\\`\n\nMoreover, with SSH sessions a pipe called\
  \ `\\\\.\\pipe\\postex_ssh_####` is created. Chage it with `set ssh_pipename \"<new_name>\";`.\n\nAlso in poext exploitation\
  \ attack the pipes `\\\\.\\pipe\\postex_####` can be modified with `set pipename \"<new_name>\"`.\n\nIn Cobalt Strike profiles\
  \ you can also modify things like:\n\n- Avoiding using `rwx`\n- How the process injection behavior works (which APIs will\
  \ be used) in the `process-inject {...}` block\n- How the \"fork and run\" works in the `post-ex {…}` block\n- The sleep\
  \ time\n- The max size of binaries to be loaded in memory\n- The memory footprint and DLL content with `stage {...}` block\n\
  - The network traffic\n\n### Bypass memory scanning\n\nSome ERDs scan memory for some know malware signatures. Coblat Strike\
  \ allows to modify the `sleep_mask` function as a BOF that will be able to encrypt in memory the bacldoor.\n\n### Noisy\
  \ proc injections\n\nWhen injecting code into a process this is usually very noisy, this is because **no regular process\
  \ usually performs this action and because the ways to do this are very limited**. Tehrefore, it' could be detected by behaviour-based\
  \ detection systems. Moroever, it could also be detected by EDRs scanning the network for **threads containing code that\
  \ is not in disk** (although processes such as browsers using JIT have this commonly). Example: [https://gist.github.com/jaredcatkinson/23905d34537ce4b5b1818c3e6405c1d2](https://gist.github.com/jaredcatkinson/23905d34537ce4b5b1818c3e6405c1d2)\n\
  \n### Spawnas | PID and PPID relationships\n\nWhen spawning a new process it's important to **maintain a regular parent-child**\
  \ relationship between processes to avoid detection. If svchost.exec is executing iexplorer.exe it'll look suspicious, as\
  \ svchost.exe is not a parent of iexplorer.exe in a normal Windows environment.\n\nWhen a new beacon is spawned in Cobalt\
  \ Strike by default a process using **`rundll32.exe`** is created to run the new listener. This is not very stealthy and\
  \ can be easily detected by EDRs. Moreover, `rundll32.exe` is run without any args making it even more suspicious.\n\nWith\
  \ the following Cobalt Strike command, you can specify a different process to spawn the new beacon, making it less detectable:\n\
  \n```bash\nspawnto x86 svchost.exe\n```\n\nYou can aso change this setting **`spawnto_x86` and `spawnto_x64`** in a profile.\n\
  \n### Proxying attackers traffic\n\nAtters sometime will need to be able to run tools lically, even in linux machines and\
  \ make the traffic of the victims reach the tool (e.g. NTLM relay).\n\nMoreover, sometimes to do a pass-the.hash or pass-the-ticket\
  \ attack it's stealthier for the attacker to **add this hash or ticket in his own LSASS process** locally and then pivot\
  \ from it instead of modifying an LSASS process of a victim machine.\n\nHowever, you need to be **careful with the generated\
  \ traffic**, as you might be sending uncommon traffic (kerberos?) from your backdoor process. For this you could pivot to\
  \ a browser process (although you could get caught injecting yourself into a process so think about a stealth way to do\
  \ this).\n\n\n### Avoiding AVs\n\n#### AV/AMSI/ETW Bypass\n\nCheck the page:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nav-bypass.md\n{{#endref}}\n\n\
  \n#### Artifact Kit\n\nUsually in `/opt/cobaltstrike/artifact-kit` you can find the code and pre-compiled templates (in\
  \ `/src-common`) of the payloads that cobalt strike is going to use to generate the binary beacons.\n\nUsing [ThreatCheck](https://github.com/rasta-mouse/ThreatCheck)\
  \ with the generated backdoor (or just with the compiled template) you can find what is making defender trigger. It's usually\
  \ a string. Therefore you can just modify the code that is generating the backdoor so that string doesn't appear in the\
  \ final binary.\n\nAfter modifying the code just run `./build.sh` from the same directory and copy the `dist-pipe/` folder\
  \ into the Windows client in `C:\\Tools\\cobaltstrike\\ArtifactKit`.\n\n```\npscp -r root@kali:/opt/cobaltstrike/artifact-kit/dist-pipe\
  \ .\n```\n\nDon't forget to load the aggressive script `dist-pipe\\artifact.cna` to indicate Cobalt Strike to use the resources\
  \ from disk that we want and not the ones loaded.\n\n#### Resource Kit\n\nThe ResourceKit folder contains the templates\
  \ for Cobalt Strike's script-based payloads including PowerShell, VBA and HTA.\n\nUsing [ThreatCheck](https://github.com/rasta-mouse/ThreatCheck)\
  \ with the templates you can find what is defender (AMSI in this case) not liking and modify it:\n\n```\n.\\ThreatCheck.exe\
  \ -e AMSI -f .\\cobaltstrike\\ResourceKit\\template.x64.ps1\n```\n\nModifying the detected lines one can generate a template\
  \ that won't be caught.\n\nDon't forget to load the aggressive script `ResourceKit\\resources.cna` to indicate Cobalt Strike\
  \ to luse the resources from disk that we want and not the ones loaded.\n\n#### Function hooks | Syscall\n\nFunction hooking\
  \ is a very common method of ERDs to detect malicious activity. Cobalt Strike allows you to bypass these hooks by using\
  \ **syscalls** instead of the standard Windows API calls using the **`None`** config, or use the `Nt*` version of a function\
  \ with the **`Direct`** setting, or just jumping over the `Nt*` function with the **`Indirect`** option in the malleable\
  \ profile. Depending on the system, an optino might be more stealth then the other.\n\nThis can be set in the profile or\
  \ suing the command **`syscall-method`**\n\n However, this could also be noisy.\n\nSome option granted by Cobalt Strike\
  \ to bypass function hooks is to remove those hooks with: [**unhook-bof**](https://github.com/Cobalt-Strike/unhook-bof).\n\
  \nYou could also check with functions are hooked with [**https://github.com/Mr-Un1k0d3r/EDRs**](https://github.com/Mr-Un1k0d3r/EDRs)\
  \ or [**https://github.com/matterpreter/OffensiveCSharp/tree/master/HookDetector**](https://github.com/matterpreter/OffensiveCSharp/tree/master/HookDetector)\n\
