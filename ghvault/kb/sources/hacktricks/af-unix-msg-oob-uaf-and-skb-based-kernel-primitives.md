_body: "# AF_UNIX MSG_OOB UAF & SKB-based kernel primitives\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n## TL;DR\n\
  \n- Linux >=6.9 introduced a flawed `manage_oob()` refactor (`5aa57d9f2d53`) for AF_UNIX `MSG_OOB` handling. Stacked zero-length\
  \ SKBs bypassed the logic that clears `u->oob_skb`, so a normal `recv()` could free the out-of-band SKB while the pointer\
  \ remained live, leading to CVE-2025-38236.\n- Re-triggering `recv(..., MSG_OOB)` dereferences the dangling `struct sk_buff`.\
  \ With `MSG_PEEK`, the path `unix_stream_recv_urg() -> __skb_datagram_iter() -> copy_to_user()` becomes a stable 1-byte\
  \ arbitrary kernel read; without `MSG_PEEK` the primitive increments `UNIXCB(oob_skb).consumed` at offset `0x44`, i.e.,\
  \ adds +4 GiB to the upper dword of any 64-bit value placed at offset `0x40` inside the reallocated object.\n- By draining\
  \ order-0/1 unmovable pages (page-table spray), force-freeing an SKB slab page into the buddy allocator, and reusing the\
  \ physical page as a pipe buffer, the exploit forges SKB metadata in controlled memory to identify the dangling page and\
  \ pivot the read primitive into `.data`, vmemmap, per-CPU, and page-table regions despite usercopy hardening.\n- The same\
  \ page can later be recycled as the top kernel-stack page of a freshly cloned thread. `CONFIG_RANDOMIZE_KSTACK_OFFSET` becomes\
  \ an oracle: by probing the stack layout while `pipe_write()` blocks, the attacker waits until the spilled `copy_page_from_iter()`\
  \ length (R14) lands at offset `0x40`, then fires the +4 GiB increment to corrupt the stack value.\n- A self-looping `skb_shinfo()->frag_list`\
  \ keeps the UAF syscall spinning in kernel space until a cooperating thread stalls `copy_from_iter()` (via `mprotect()`\
  \ over a VMA containing a single `MADV_DONTNEED` hole). Breaking the loop releases the increment exactly when the stack\
  \ target is live, inflating the `bytes` argument so `copy_page_from_iter()` writes past the pipe buffer page into the next\
  \ physical page.\n- By monitoring pipe-buffer PFNs and page tables with the read primitive, the attacker ensures the following\
  \ page is a PTE page, converts the OOB copy into arbitrary PTE writes, and obtains unrestricted kernel read/write/execute.\
  \ Chrome mitigated reachability by blocking `MSG_OOB` from renderers (`6711812`), and Linux fixed the logic flaw in `32ca245464e1`\
  \ plus introduced `CONFIG_AF_UNIX_OOB` to make the feature optional.\n\n## Root cause: `manage_oob()` assumes only one zero-length\
  \ SKB\n\n`unix_stream_read_generic()` expects every SKB returned by `manage_oob()` to have `unix_skb_len() > 0`. After `93c99f21db36`,\
  \ `manage_oob()` skipped the `skb == u->oob_skb` cleanup path whenever it first removed a zero-length SKB left behind by\
  \ `recv(MSG_OOB)`. The subsequent fix (`5aa57d9f2d53`) still advanced from the first zero-length SKB to `skb_peek_next()`\
  \ without re-checking the length. With two consecutive zero-length SKBs, the function returned the second empty SKB; `unix_stream_read_generic()`\
  \ then skipped it without calling `manage_oob()` again, so the true OOB SKB was dequeued and freed while `u->oob_skb` still\
  \ pointed to it.\n\n### Minimal trigger sequence\n\n```c\nchar byte;\nint socks[2];\nsocketpair(AF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM, 0,\
  \ socks);\nfor (int i = 0; i < 2; ++i) {\n    send(socks[1], \"A\", 1, MSG_OOB);\n    recv(socks[0], &byte, 1, MSG_OOB);\n\
  }\nsend(socks[1], \"A\", 1, MSG_OOB);   // SKB3, u->oob_skb = SKB3\nrecv(socks[0], &byte, 1, 0);         // normal recv\
  \ frees SKB3\nrecv(socks[0], &byte, 1, MSG_OOB);   // dangling u->oob_skb\n```\n\n## Primitives exposed by `unix_stream_recv_urg()`\n\
  \n1. **1-byte arbitrary read (repeatable):** `state->recv_actor()` ultimately performs `copy_to_user(user, skb_sourced_addr,\
  \ 1)`. If the dangling SKB is reallocated into attacker-controlled memory (or into a controlled alias such as a pipe page),\
  \ every `recv(MSG_OOB | MSG_PEEK)` copies a byte from an arbitrary kernel address allowed by `__check_object_size()` to\
  \ user space without crashing. Keeping `MSG_PEEK` set preserves the dangling pointer for unlimited reads.\n2. **Constrained\
  \ write:** When `MSG_PEEK` is clear, `UNIXCB(oob_skb).consumed += 1` increments the 32-bit field at offset `0x44`. On 0x100-aligned\
  \ SKB allocations this sits four bytes above an 8-byte aligned word, converting the primitive into a +4 GiB increment of\
  \ the word hosted at offset `0x40`. Turning this into a kernel write requires positioning a sensitive 64-bit value at that\
  \ offset.\n\n## Reallocating the SKB page for arbitrary read\n\n1. **Drain order-0/1 unmovable freelists:** Map a huge read-only\
  \ anonymous VMA and fault every page to force page-table allocation (order-0 unmovable). Filling ~10% of RAM with page tables\
  \ ensures subsequent `skbuff_head_cache` allocations pull fresh buddy pages once order-0 lists exhaust.\n2. **Spray SKBs\
  \ and isolate a slab page:** Use dozens of stream socketpairs and queue hundreds of small messages per socket (~0x100 bytes\
  \ per SKB) to populate `skbuff_head_cache`. Free chosen SKBs to drive a target slab page entirely under attacker control\
  \ and monitor its `struct page` refcount via the emerging read primitive.\n3. **Return the slab page to the buddy allocator:**\
  \ Free every object on the page, then perform enough additional allocations/frees to push the page out of SLUB per-CPU partial\
  \ lists and per-CPU page lists so it becomes an order-1 page on the buddy freelist.\n4. **Reallocate as pipe buffer:** Create\
  \ hundreds of pipes; each pipe reserves at least two 0x1000-byte data pages (`PIPE_MIN_DEF_BUFFERS`). When the buddy allocator\
  \ splits an order-1 page, one half reuses the freed SKB page. To locate which pipe and which offset aliases `oob_skb`, write\
  \ unique marker bytes into fake SKBs stored throughout pipe pages and issue repeated `recv(MSG_OOB | MSG_PEEK)` calls until\
  \ the marker is returned.\n5. **Forge a stable SKB layout:** Populate the aliased pipe page with a fake `struct sk_buff`\
  \ whose `data`/`head` pointers and `skb_shared_info` structure point to arbitrary kernel addresses of interest. Because\
  \ x86_64 disables SMAP inside `copy_to_user()`, user-mode addresses can serve as staging buffers until kernel pointers are\
  \ known.\n6. **Respect usercopy hardening:** The copy succeeds against `.data/.bss`, vmemmap entries, per-CPU vmalloc ranges,\
  \ other threads' kernel stacks, and direct-map pages that do not straddle higher-order folio boundaries. Reads against `.text`\
  \ or specialized caches rejected by `__check_heap_object()` simply return `-EFAULT` without killing the process.\n\n## Introspecting\
  \ allocators with the read primitive\n\n- **Break KASLR:** Read any IDT descriptor from the fixed mapping at `CPU_ENTRY_AREA_RO_IDT_VADDR`\
  \ (`0xfffffe0000000000`) and subtract the known handler offset to recover the kernel base.\n- **SLUB/buddy state:** Global\
  \ `.data` symbols reveal `kmem_cache` bases, while vmemmap entries expose each page's type flags, freelist pointer, and\
  \ owning cache. Scanning per-CPU vmalloc segments uncovers `struct kmem_cache_cpu` instances so the next allocation address\
  \ of key caches (e.g., `skbuff_head_cache`, `kmalloc-cg-192`) becomes predictable.\n- **Page tables:** Instead of reading\
  \ `mm_struct` (blocked by usercopy), walk the global `pgd_list` (`struct ptdesc`) and match the current `mm_struct` via\
  \ `cpu_tlbstate.loaded_mm`. Once the root `pgd` is known, the primitive can traverse every page table to map PFNs for pipe\
  \ buffers, page tables, and kernel stacks.\n\n## Recycling the SKB page as the top kernel-stack page\n\n1. Free the controlled\
  \ pipe page again and confirm via vmemmap that its refcount returns to zero.\n2. Immediately allocate four helper pipe pages\
  \ and then free them in reverse order so the buddy allocator's LIFO behavior is deterministic.\n3. Call `clone()` to spawn\
  \ a helper thread; Linux stacks are four pages on x86_64, so the four most recently freed pages become its stack, with the\
  \ last freed page (the former SKB page) at the highest addresses.\n4. Verify via page-table walk that the helper thread's\
  \ top stack PFN equals the recycled SKB PFN.\n5. Use the arbitrary read to observe the stack layout while steering the thread\
  \ into `pipe_write()`. `CONFIG_RANDOMIZE_KSTACK_OFFSET` subtracts a random 0x0–0x3f0 (aligned) from `RSP` per syscall; repeated\
  \ writes combined with `poll()`/`read()` from another thread reveal when the writer blocks with the desired offset. When\
  \ lucky, the spilled `copy_page_from_iter()` `bytes` argument (R14) sits at offset `0x40` inside the recycled page.\n\n\
  ## Placing fake SKB metadata on the stack\n\n- Use `sendmsg()` on an AF_UNIX datagram socket: the kernel copies the user\
  \ `sockaddr_un` into a stack-resident `sockaddr_storage` (up to 108 bytes) and the ancillary data into another on-stack\
  \ buffer before the syscall blocks waiting for queue space. This allows planting a precise fake SKB structure in stack memory.\n\
  - Detect when the copy finished by supplying a 1-byte control message located in an unmapped user page; `____sys_sendmsg()`\
  \ faults it in, so a helper thread polling `mincore()` on that address learns when the destination page is present.\n- Zero-initialized\
  \ padding from `CONFIG_INIT_STACK_ALL_ZERO` conveniently fills unused fields, completing a valid SKB header without extra\
  \ writes.\n\n## Timing the +4 GiB increment with a self-looping frag list\n\n- Forge `skb_shinfo(fakeskb)->frag_list` to\
  \ point to a second fake SKB (stored in attacker-controlled user memory) that has `len = 0` and `next = &self`. When `skb_walk_frags()`\
  \ iterates this list inside `__skb_datagram_iter()`, execution spins indefinitely because the iterator never reaches `NULL`\
  \ and the copy loop makes no progress.\n- Keep the recv syscall running inside the kernel by letting the second fake SKB\
  \ self-loop. When it's time to fire the increment, simply change the second SKB's `next` pointer from user space to `NULL`.\
  \ The loop exits and `unix_stream_recv_urg()` immediately executes `UNIXCB(oob_skb).consumed += 1` once, affecting whatever\
  \ object currently occupies the recycled stack page at offset `0x40`.\n\n## Stalling `copy_from_iter()` without userfaultfd\n\
  \n- Map a giant anonymous RW VMA and fault it in fully.\n- Punch a single-page hole with `madvise(MADV_DONTNEED, hole, PAGE_SIZE)`\
  \ and place that address inside the `iov_iter` used for `write(pipefd, user_buf, 0x3000)`.\n- In parallel, call `mprotect()`\
  \ on the entire VMA from another thread. The syscall grabs the mmap write lock and walks every PTE. When the pipe writer\
  \ reaches the hole, the page fault handler blocks on the mmap lock held by `mprotect()`, pausing `copy_from_iter()` at a\
  \ deterministic point while the spilled `bytes` value resides on the stack segment hosted by the recycled SKB page.\n\n\
  ## Turning the increment into arbitrary PTE writes\n\n1. **Fire the increment:** Release the frag loop while `copy_from_iter()`\
  \ is stalled so the +4 GiB increment hits the `bytes` variable.\n2. **Overflow the copy:** Once the fault resumes, `copy_page_from_iter()`\
  \ believes it can copy >4 GiB into the current pipe page. After filling the legitimate 0x2000 bytes (two pipe buffers),\
  \ it executes another iteration and writes the remaining user data into whatever physical page follows the pipe buffer PFN.\n\
  3. **Arrange adjacency:** Using allocator telemetry, force the buddy allocator to place a process-owned PTE page immediately\
  \ after the target pipe buffer page (e.g., alternate between allocating pipe pages and touching new virtual ranges to trigger\
  \ page-table allocation until the PFNs align inside the same 2 MiB pageblock).\n4. **Overwrite page tables:** Encode desired\
  \ PTE entries in the extra 0x1000 bytes of user data so the OOB `copy_from_iter()` fills the neighbouring page with attacker-chosen\
  \ entries, granting RW/RWX user mappings of kernel physical memory or rewriting existing entries to disable SMEP/SMAP.\n\
  \n## Mitigations / hardening ideas\n\n- **Kernel:** Apply `32ca245464e1479bfea8592b9db227fdc1641705` (properly revalidates\
  \ SKBs) and consider disabling AF_UNIX OOB entirely unless strictly needed via `CONFIG_AF_UNIX_OOB` (`5155cbcdbf03`). Harden\
  \ `manage_oob()` with additional sanity checks (e.g., loop until `unix_skb_len() > 0`) and audit other socket protocols\
  \ for similar assumptions.\n- **Sandboxing:** Filter `MSG_OOB`/`MSG_PEEK` flags in seccomp profiles or higher-level broker\
  \ APIs (Chrome change `6711812` now blocks renderer-side `MSG_OOB`).\n- **Allocator defenses:** Strengthening SLUB freelist\
  \ randomization or enforcing per-cache page coloring would complicate deterministic page recycling; pipeline-limiting of\
  \ pipe buffer counts also reduces reallocation reliability.\n- **Monitoring:** Expose high-rate page-table allocation or\
  \ abnormal pipe usage via telemetry—this exploit burns large amounts of page tables and pipe buffers.\n\n## References\n\
