_body: "# Print Stack Canary\n\n{{#include ../../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n## Enlarge printed stack\n\nImagine\
  \ a situation where a **program vulnerable** to stack overflow can execute a **puts** function **pointing** to **part**\
  \ of the **stack overflow**. The attacker knows that the **first byte of the canary is a null byte** (`\\x00`) and the rest\
  \ of the canary are **random** bytes. Then, the attacker may create an overflow that **overwrites the stack until just the\
  \ first byte of the canary**.\n\nThen, the attacker **calls the puts functionalit**y on the middle of the payload which\
  \ will **print all the canary** (except from the first null byte).\n\nWith this info the attacker can **craft and send a\
  \ new attack** knowing the canary (in the same program session).\n\nObviously, this tactic is very **restricted** as the\
  \ attacker needs to be able to **print** the **content** of his **payload** to **exfiltrate** the **canary** and then be\
  \ able to create a new payload (in the **same program session**) and **send** the **real buffer overflow**.\n\n**CTF examples:**\n\
  \n- [**https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/08-bof_dynamic/csawquals17_svc/index.html**](https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/08-bof_dynamic/csawquals17_svc/index.html)\n\
  \  - 64 bit, ASLR enabled but no PIE, the first step is to fill an overflow until the byte 0x00 of the canary to then call\
  \ puts and leak it. With the canary a ROP gadget is created to call puts to leak the address of puts from the GOT and the\
  \ a ROP gadget to call `system('/bin/sh')`\n- [**https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/14-ret_2_system/hxp18_poorCanary/index.html**](https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/14-ret_2_system/hxp18_poorCanary/index.html)\n\
  \  - 32 bit, ARM, no relro, canary, nx, no pie. Overflow with a call to puts on it to leak the canary + ret2lib calling\
  \ `system` with a ROP chain to pop r0 (arg `/bin/sh`) and pc (address of system)\n\n## Arbitrary Read\n\nWith an **arbitrary\
  \ read** like the one provided by format **strings** it might be possible to leak the canary. Check this example: [**https://ir0nstone.gitbook.io/notes/types/stack/canaries**](https://ir0nstone.gitbook.io/notes/types/stack/canaries)\
  \ and you can read about abusing format strings to read arbitrary memory addresses in:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\n../../format-strings/\n\
  {{#endref}}\n\n- [https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/14-ret_2_system/asis17_marymorton/index.html](https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/14-ret_2_system/asis17_marymorton/index.html)\n\
  \  - This challenge abuses in a very simple way a format string to read the canary from the stack\n\n{{#include ../../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}"
