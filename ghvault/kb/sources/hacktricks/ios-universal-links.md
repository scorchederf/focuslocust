_body: "# iOS Universal Links\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n## Introduction\n\nUniversal links offer\
  \ a **seamless redirection** experience to users by directly opening content in the app, bypassing the need for Safari redirection.\
  \ These links are **unique** and secure, as they cannot be claimed by other apps. This is ensured by hosting a `apple-app-site-association`\
  \ JSON file on the website's root directory, establishing a verifiable link between the website and the app. In cases where\
  \ the app is not installed, Safari will take over and direct the user to the webpage, maintaining the app's presence.\n\n\
  For penetration testers, the `apple-app-site-association` file is of particular interest as it may reveal **sensitive paths**,\
  \ potentially including ones related to unreleased features.\n\n### **Analyzing the Associated Domains Entitlement**\n\n\
  Developers enable Universal Links by configuring the **Associated Domains** in Xcode's Capabilities tab or by inspecting\
  \ the `.entitlements` file. Each domain is prefixed with `applinks:`. For example, Telegram's configuration might appear\
  \ as follows:\n\n```xml\n    <key>com.apple.developer.associated-domains</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>applinks:telegram.me</string>\n\
  \        <string>applinks:t.me</string>\n    </array>\n```\n\nFor more comprehensive insights, refer to the [archived Apple\
  \ Developer Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Conceptual/AppSearch/UniversalLinks.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40016308-CH12-SW2).\n\
  \nIf working with a compiled application, entitlements can be extracted as outlined in [this guide](extracting-entitlements-from-compiled-application.md).\n\
  \n### **Retrieving the Apple App Site Association File**\n\nThe `apple-app-site-association` file should be retrieved from\
  \ the server using the domains specified in the entitlements. Ensure the file is accessible via HTTPS directly at `https://<domain>/apple-app-site-association`\
  \ (or `/.well-known/apple-app-site-association`). Tools like the [Apple App Site Association (AASA) Validator](https://branch.io/resources/aasa-validator/)\
  \ can aid in this process.\n\n> **Quick enumeration from a macOS/Linux shell**\n>\n> ```bash\n> # assuming you have extracted\
  \ the entitlements to ent.xml\n> doms=$(plutil -extract com.apple.developer.associated-domains xml1 -o - ent.xml | \\\n\
  >        grep -oE 'applinks:[^<]+' | cut -d':' -f2)\n> for d in $doms; do\n>   echo \"[+] Fetching AASA for $d\";\n>   curl\
  \ -sk \"https://$d/.well-known/apple-app-site-association\" | jq '.'\n> done\n> ```\n\n### **Handling Universal Links in\
  \ the App**\n\nThe app must implement specific methods to handle universal links correctly. The primary method to look for\
  \ is [`application:continueUserActivity:restorationHandler:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiapplicationdelegate/1623072-application).\
  \ It's crucial that the scheme of URLs handled is HTTP or HTTPS, as others will not be supported.\n\n#### **Validating the\
  \ Data Handler Method**\n\nWhen a universal link opens an app, an `NSUserActivity` object is passed to the app with the\
  \ URL. Before processing this URL, it's essential to validate and sanitize it to prevent security risks. Here's an example\
  \ in Swift that demonstrates the process:\n\n```swift\nfunc application(_ application: UIApplication, continue userActivity:\
  \ NSUserActivity,\n                 restorationHandler: @escaping ([UIUserActivityRestoring]?) -> Void) -> Bool {\n    //\
  \ Check for web browsing activity and valid URL\n    if userActivity.activityType == NSUserActivityTypeBrowsingWeb, let\
  \ url = userActivity.webpageURL {\n        application.open(url, options: [:], completionHandler: nil)\n    }\n\n    return\
  \ true\n}\n```\n\nURLs should be carefully parsed and validated, especially if they include parameters, to guard against\
  \ potential spoofing or malformed data. The `NSURLComponents` API is useful for this purpose, as demonstrated below:\n\n\
  ```swift\nfunc application(_ application: UIApplication,\n                 continue userActivity: NSUserActivity,\n    \
  \             restorationHandler: @escaping ([Any]?) -> Void) -> Bool {\n    guard userActivity.activityType == NSUserActivityTypeBrowsingWeb,\n\
  \        let incomingURL = userActivity.webpageURL,\n        let components = NSURLComponents(url: incomingURL, resolvingAgainstBaseURL:\
  \ true),\n        let path = components.path,\n        let params = components.queryItems else {\n        return false\n\
  \    }\n\n    if let albumName = params.first(where: { $0.name == \"albumname\" })?.value,\n        let photoIndex = params.first(where:\
  \ { $0.name == \"index\" })?.value {\n        // Process the URL with album name and photo index\n\n        return true\n\
  \n    } else {\n        // Handle invalid or missing parameters\n\n        return false\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThrough **diligent\
  \ configuration and validation**, developers can ensure that universal links enhance user experience while maintaining security\
  \ and privacy standards.\n\n## Common Vulnerabilities & Pentesting Checks\n\n| # | Weakness | How to test | Exploitation\
  \ / Impact |\n|---|----------|------------|-----------------------|\n| 1 | **Over-broad `paths` / `components`** in the\
  \ AASA file (e.g. `\"/\": \"*\"` or wildcards such as `\"/a/*\"`). | • Inspect the downloaded AASA and look for `*`, trailing\
  \ slashes, or `{\"?\": …}` rules.<br>• Try to request unknown resources that still match the rule (`https://domain.com/a/evil?_p_dp=1`).\
  \ | Universal-link hijacking: a malicious iOS app that registers the same domain could claim all those links and present\
  \ phishing UI. A real-world example is the May 2025 Temu.com bug-bounty report where an attacker could redirect any `/a/*`\
  \ path to their own app. |\n| 2 | **Missing server-side validation** of deep-link paths. | After identifying the allowed\
  \ paths, issue `curl`/Burp requests to non-existing resources and observe HTTP status codes. Anything other than `404` (e.g.\
  \ 200/302) is suspicious. | An attacker can host arbitrary content behind an allowed path and serve it via the legitimate\
  \ domain, increasing the success rate of phishing or session-token theft. |\n| 3 | **App-side URL handling without scheme/host\
  \ whitelisting** (CVE-2024-10474 – Mozilla Focus < 132). | Look for direct `openURL:`/`open(_:options:)` calls or JavaScript\
  \ bridges that forward arbitrary URLs. | Internal pages can smuggle `myapp://` or `https://` URLs that bypass the browser’s\
  \ URL-bar safety checks, leading to spoofing or unintended privileged actions. |\n| 4 | **Use of wildcard sub-domains**\
  \ (`*.example.com`) in the entitlement. | `grep` for `*.` in the entitlements. | If any sub-domain is taken over (e.g. via\
  \ an unused S3 bucket), the attacker automatically gains the Universal Link binding. |\n\n### Quick Checklist\n\n* [ ] Extract\
  \ entitlements and enumerate every `applinks:` entry.\n* [ ] Download AASA for each entry and audit for wildcards.\n* [\
  \ ] Verify the web server returns **404** for undefined paths.\n* [ ] In the binary, confirm that **only** trusted hosts/schemes\
  \ are handled.\n* [ ] If the app uses the newer `components` syntax (iOS 11+), fuzz query-parameter rules (`{\"?\":{…}}`).\n\
  \n## Tools\n\n- [GetUniversal.link](https://getuniversal.link/): Helps simplify the testing and management of your app's\
  \ Universal Links and AASA file. Simply enter your domain to verify AASA file integrity or use the custom dashboard to easily\
  \ test link behavior. This tool also helps you determine when Apple will next index your AASA file.\n- [Knil](https://github.com/ethanhuang13/knil):\
  \ Open-source iOS utility that fetches, parses and lets you **tap-test** every Universal Link declared by a domain directly\
  \ on device.\n- [universal-link-validator](https://github.com/urbangems/universal-link-validator): CLI / web validator that\
  \ performs strict AASA conformance checks and highlights dangerous wildcards.\n\n## References\n\n- [https://mas.owasp.org/MASTG/tests/ios/MASVS-PLATFORM/MASTG-TEST-0070/#static-analysis](https://mas.owasp.org/MASTG/tests/ios/MASVS-PLATFORM/MASTG-TEST-0070/#static-analysis)\n\
