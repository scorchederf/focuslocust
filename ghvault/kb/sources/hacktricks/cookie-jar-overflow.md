_body: "# Cookie Jar Overflow\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\nCookie jar overflow abuses the fact\
  \ that browsers cap how many cookies they keep for one site/jar. If you can run JavaScript in the victim origin (typically\
  \ via XSS), you can keep creating cookies until older entries are evicted, then recreate the target cookie with attacker-controlled\
  \ data.\n\nThe exact threshold is browser-dependent. The current spec only requires user agents to support at least **50\
  \ cookies per domain**, while current Chromium builds use **180 cookies per eTLD+1** and **180 per partitioned jar**. Therefore,\
  \ do **not** hardcode `700` cookies and assume it will always work.\n\n```javascript\nconst attrs = \"Path=/\";\nlet prev\
  \ = -1;\n\nfor (let i = 0; i < 400; i++) {\n  document.cookie = `junk${i}=${\"A\".repeat(32)}; ${attrs}`;\n  const visible\
  \ = document.cookie ? document.cookie.split(/; */).length : 0;\n  if (visible === prev) break;\n  prev = visible;\n}\n```\n\
  \n`document.cookie` only shows non-`HttpOnly` cookies, so in practice it is common to go a bit above the visible plateau\
  \ to force eviction of hidden cookies as well.\n\n## Overwriting `HttpOnly` Cookies\n\nThis technique can still be used\
  \ to **evict an `HttpOnly` cookie and then recreate it without `HttpOnly`**, but only if you can **match the original scope**\
  \ (`name`, `Path`, and host/`Domain` behavior):\n\n```javascript\nconst targetScope = \"Path=/app; Secure\";\n\nfor (let\
  \ i = 0; i < 250; i++) {\n  document.cookie = `junk${i}=${crypto.randomUUID()}; ${targetScope}`;\n}\n\ndocument.cookie =\
  \ `session=attacker-controlled; ${targetScope}`;\n```\n\nIf the original cookie was set for a different `Path` or with a\
  \ wider `Domain`, you may only create a sibling cookie and the server will receive both. At that point, ordering rules and\
  \ server parsing decide which one wins, so check [cookie tossing](cookie-tossing.md) as well.\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n> This attack\
  \ does **not** let JavaScript modify `HttpOnly` in place. The practical primitive is: **evict first, then create a new non-`HttpOnly`\
  \ cookie with the same scope**.\n>\n> Check the original lab in [**this post**](https://www.sjoerdlangkemper.nl/2020/05/27/overwriting-httponly-cookies-from-javascript-using-cookie-jar-overflow/).\n\
  \n## Reliability Notes\n\n- **Eviction is not always \"oldest cookie first\"**. In Chromium the garbage collector is LRU-like\
  \ and tends to preserve more valuable cookies longer, especially `Secure` and higher-priority cookies. A recently used session\
  \ cookie is usually harder to evict than a stale low-priority one.\n- **Profile the real cookie first**. Before overflowing,\
  \ capture the original `Set-Cookie` in Burp/DevTools and note `Path`, `Domain`, `Priority`, prefixes, and whether the cookie\
  \ is `Partitioned`.\n- **Prefer first-party execution**. Modern browsers increasingly isolate or block third-party cookies.\
  \ If the cookie is partitioned (`Partitioned` / CHIPS, or browser-enforced third-party partitioning), overflowing the jar\
  \ of `cdn.example` while embedded in `siteA.com` will not evict the cookie that the same origin uses as a top-level site\
  \ or while embedded in `siteB.com`.\n- **New prefixed cookies reduce the impact**. In browsers that enforce the newer `__Http-`\
  \ and `__Host-Http-` prefixes, JavaScript cannot recreate those cookies with `document.cookie`. You may still evict them,\
  \ but you cannot mint a same-named replacement client-side.\n\n## References\n\n- [Chromium eviction notes](https://blog.yoav.ws/posts/how_chromium_cookies_get_evicted/)\n\
