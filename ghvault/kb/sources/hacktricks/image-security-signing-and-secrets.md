_body: "# Image Security, Signing, And Secrets\n\n{{#include ../../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n## Overview\n\n\
  Container security starts before the workload is launched. The image determines which binaries, interpreters, libraries,\
  \ startup scripts, and embedded configuration reach production. If the image is backdoored, stale, or built with secrets\
  \ baked into it, the runtime hardening that follows is already operating on a compromised artifact.\n\nThis is why image\
  \ provenance, vulnerability scanning, signature verification, and secret handling belong in the same conversation as namespaces\
  \ and seccomp. They protect a different phase of the lifecycle, but failures here often define the attack surface the runtime\
  \ later has to contain.\n\n## Image Registries And Trust\n\nImages may come from public registries such as Docker Hub or\
  \ from private registries operated by an organization. The security question is not simply where the image lives, but whether\
  \ the team can establish provenance and integrity. Pulling unsigned or poorly tracked images from public sources increases\
  \ the risk of malicious or tampered content entering production. Even internally hosted registries need clear ownership,\
  \ review, and trust policy.\n\nDocker Content Trust historically used Notary and TUF concepts to require signed images.\
  \ The exact ecosystem has evolved, but the enduring lesson remains useful: image identity and integrity should be verifiable\
  \ rather than assumed.\n\nExample historical Docker Content Trust workflow:\n\n```bash\nexport DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1\n\
  docker pull nginx:latest\ntar -zcvf private_keys_backup.tar.gz ~/.docker/trust/private\n```\n\nThe point of the example\
  \ is not that every team must still use the same tooling, but that signing and key management are operational tasks, not\
  \ abstract theory.\n\n## Vulnerability Scanning\n\nImage scanning helps answer two different questions. First, does the\
  \ image contain known vulnerable packages or libraries? Second, does the image carry unnecessary software that expands the\
  \ attack surface? An image full of debugging tools, shells, interpreters, and stale packages is both easier to exploit and\
  \ harder to reason about.\n\nExamples of commonly used scanners include:\n\n```bash\ndocker scan hello-world\ntrivy -q -f\
  \ json alpine:3.19\nsnyk container test nginx:latest --severity-threshold=high\nclair-scanner -w example-alpine.yaml --ip\
  \ YOUR_LOCAL_IP alpine:3.5\n```\n\nResults from these tools should be interpreted carefully. A vulnerability in an unused\
  \ package is not identical in risk to an exposed RCE path, but both are still relevant to hardening decisions.\n\n## Build-Time\
  \ Secrets\n\nOne of the oldest mistakes in container build pipelines is embedding secrets directly into the image or passing\
  \ them through environment variables that later become visible through `docker inspect`, build logs, or recovered layers.\
  \ Build-time secrets should be mounted ephemerally during the build rather than copied into the image filesystem.\n\nBuildKit\
  \ improved this model by allowing dedicated build-time secret handling. Instead of writing a secret into a layer, the build\
  \ step can consume it transiently:\n\n```bash\nexport DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1\ndocker build --secret id=my_key,src=path/to/my_secret_file\
  \ .\n```\n\nThis matters because image layers are durable artifacts. Once a secret enters a committed layer, later deleting\
  \ the file in another layer does not truly remove the original disclosure from the image history.\n\n## Runtime Secrets\n\
  \nSecrets needed by a running workload should also avoid ad hoc patterns such as plain environment variables whenever possible.\
  \ Volumes, dedicated secret-management integrations, Docker secrets, and Kubernetes Secrets are common mechanisms. None\
  \ of these removes all risk, especially if the attacker already has code execution in the workload, but they are still preferable\
  \ to storing credentials permanently in the image or exposing them casually through inspection tooling.\n\nA simple Docker\
  \ Compose style secret declaration looks like:\n\n```yaml\nversion: \"3.7\"\nservices:\n  my_service:\n    image: centos:7\n\
  \    entrypoint: \"cat /run/secrets/my_secret\"\n    secrets:\n      - my_secret\nsecrets:\n  my_secret:\n    file: ./my_secret_file.txt\n\
  ```\n\nIn Kubernetes, Secret objects, projected volumes, service-account tokens, and cloud workload identities create a\
  \ broader and more powerful model, but they also create more opportunities for accidental exposure through host mounts,\
  \ broad RBAC, or weak Pod design.\n\n## Abuse\n\nWhen reviewing a target, the aim is to discover whether secrets were baked\
  \ into the image, leaked into layers, or mounted into predictable runtime locations:\n\n```bash\nenv | grep -iE 'secret|token|key|passwd|password'\n\
  find / -maxdepth 4 \\( -iname '*.env' -o -iname '*secret*' -o -iname '*token*' \\) 2>/dev/null | head -n 100\ngrep -RniE\
  \ 'secret|token|apikey|password' /app /srv /usr/src 2>/dev/null | head -n 100\n```\n\nThese commands help distinguish between\
  \ three different problems: application configuration leaks, image-layer leaks, and runtime-injected secret files. If a\
  \ secret appears under `/run/secrets`, a projected volume, or a cloud identity token path, the next step is to understand\
  \ whether it grants access only to the current workload or to a much larger control plane.\n\n### Full Example: Embedded\
  \ Secret In Image Filesystem\n\nIf a build pipeline copied `.env` files or credentials into the final image, post-exploitation\
  \ becomes simple:\n\n```bash\nfind / -type f -iname '*.env*' 2>/dev/null\ncat /usr/src/app/.env 2>/dev/null\ngrep -iE 'secret|token|jwt|password'\
  \ /usr/src/app/.env 2>/dev/null\n```\n\nThe impact depends on the application, but embedded signing keys, JWT secrets, or\
  \ cloud credentials can easily turn container compromise into API compromise, lateral movement, or forgery of trusted application\
  \ tokens.\n\n### Full Example: Build-Time Secret Leakage Check\n\nIf the concern is that the image history captured a secret-bearing\
  \ layer:\n\n```bash\ndocker history --no-trunc <image>\ndocker save <image> -o /tmp/image.tar\ntar -tf /tmp/image.tar |\
  \ head\n```\n\nThis kind of review is useful because a secret may have been deleted from the final filesystem view while\
  \ still remaining in an earlier layer or in build metadata.\n\n## Checks\n\nThese checks are intended to establish whether\
  \ the image and secret-handling pipeline are likely to have increased the attack surface before runtime.\n\n```bash\ndocker\
  \ history --no-trunc <image> 2>/dev/null\nenv | grep -iE 'secret|token|key|passwd|password'\nfind /run /var/run /var/lib/kubelet\
  \ -type f -iname '*token*' 2>/dev/null | head -n 50\ngrep -RniE 'secret|token|apikey|password' /etc /app /srv /usr/src 2>/dev/null\
  \ | head -n 100\n```\n\nWhat is interesting here:\n\n- A suspicious build history may reveal copied credentials, SSH material,\
  \ or unsafe build steps.\n- Secrets under projected volume paths may lead to cluster or cloud access, not just local application\
  \ access.\n- Large numbers of configuration files with plaintext credentials usually indicate that the image or deployment\
  \ model is carrying more trust material than necessary.\n\n## Runtime Defaults\n\n| Runtime / platform | Default state |\
  \ Default behavior | Common manual weakening |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Docker / BuildKit | Supports secure build-time\
  \ secret mounts, but not automatically | Secrets can be mounted ephemerally during `build`; image signing and scanning require\
  \ explicit workflow choices | copying secrets into the image, passing secrets by `ARG` or `ENV`, disabling provenance checks\
  \ |\n| Podman / Buildah | Supports OCI-native builds and secret-aware workflows | Strong build workflows are available,\
  \ but operators must still choose them intentionally | embedding secrets in Containerfiles, broad build contexts, permissive\
  \ bind mounts during builds |\n| Kubernetes | Native Secret objects and projected volumes | Runtime secret delivery is first-class,\
  \ but exposure depends on RBAC, pod design, and host mounts | overbroad Secret mounts, service-account token misuse, `hostPath`\
  \ access to kubelet-managed volumes |\n| Registries | Integrity is optional unless enforced | Public and private registries\
  \ both depend on policy, signing, and admission decisions | pulling unsigned images freely, weak admission control, poor\
  \ key management |\n{{#include ../../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}"
