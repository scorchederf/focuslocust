_body: "# macOS Security Protections\n\n{{#include ../../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n## Gatekeeper\n\nGatekeeper\
  \ is usually used to refer to the combination of **Quarantine + Gatekeeper + XProtect**, 3 macOS security modules that will\
  \ try to **prevent users from executing potentially malicious software downloaded**.\n\nMore information in:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\n\
  macos-gatekeeper.md\n{{#endref}}\n\n## Processes Limitants\n\n### MACF\n\n### SIP - System Integrity Protection\n\n\n{{#ref}}\n\
  macos-sip.md\n{{#endref}}\n\n### Sandbox\n\nMacOS Sandbox **limits applications** running inside the sandbox to the **allowed\
  \ actions specified in the Sandbox profile** the app is running with. This helps to ensure that **the application will be\
  \ accessing only expected resources**.\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nmacos-sandbox/\n{{#endref}}\n\n### TCC - **Transparency, Consent,\
  \ and Control**\n\n**TCC (Transparency, Consent, and Control)** is a security framework. It's designed to **manage the permissions**\
  \ of applications, specifically by regulating their access to sensitive features. This includes elements like **location\
  \ services, contacts, photos, microphone, camera, accessibility, and full disk access**. TCC ensures that apps can only\
  \ access these features after obtaining explicit user consent, thereby bolstering privacy and control over personal data.\n\
  \n\n{{#ref}}\nmacos-tcc/\n{{#endref}}\n\n### Launch/Environment Constraints & Trust Cache\n\nLaunch constraints in macOS\
  \ are a security feature to **regulate process initiation** by defining **who can launch** a process, **how**, and **from\
  \ where**. Introduced in macOS Ventura, they categorize system binaries into constraint categories within a **trust cache**.\
  \ Every executable binary has set **rules** for its **launch**, including **self**, **parent**, and **responsible** constraints.\
  \ Extended to third-party apps as **Environment** Constraints in macOS Sonoma, these features help mitigate potential system\
  \ exploitations by governing process launching conditions.\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nmacos-launch-environment-constraints.md\n{{#endref}}\n\
  \n## MRT - Malware Removal Tool\n\nThe Malware Removal Tool (MRT) is another part of macOS's security infrastructure. As\
  \ the name suggests, MRT's main function is to **remove known malware from infected systems**.\n\nOnce malware is detected\
  \ on a Mac (either by XProtect or by some other means), MRT can be used to automatically **remove the malware**. MRT operates\
  \ silently in the background and typically runs whenever the system is updated or when a new malware definition is downloaded\
  \ (it looks like the rules MRT has to detect malware are inside the binary).\n\nWhile both XProtect and MRT are part of\
  \ macOS's security measures, they perform different functions:\n\n- **XProtect** is a preventative tool. It **checks files\
  \ as they're downloaded** (via certain applications), and if it detects any known types of malware, it **prevents the file\
  \ from opening**, thereby preventing the malware from infecting your system in the first place.\n- **MRT**, on the other\
  \ hand, is a **reactive tool**. It operates after malware has been detected on a system, with the goal of removing the offending\
  \ software to clean up the system.\n\nThe MRT application is located in **`/Library/Apple/System/Library/CoreServices/MRT.app`**\n\
  \n## Background Tasks Management\n\n**macOS** now **alerts** every time a tool uses a well known **technique to persist\
  \ code execution** (such as Login Items, Daemons...), so the user knows better **which software is persisting**.\n\n<figure><img\
  \ src=\"../../../images/image (1183).png\" alt=\"\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\nThis runs with a **daemon** located\
  \ in `/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/BackgroundTaskManagement.framework/Versions/A/Resources/backgroundtaskmanagementd`\
  \ and the **agent** in `/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/BackgroundTaskManagement.framework/Support/BackgroundTaskManagementAgent.app`\n\
  \nThe way **`backgroundtaskmanagementd`** knows something is installed in a persistent folder is by **getting the FSEvents**\
  \ and creating some **handlers** for those.\n\nMoreover, there is a plist file that contains **well known applications**\
  \ that frequently persists maintained by apple located in: `/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/BackgroundTaskManagement.framework/Versions/A/Resources/attributions.plist`\n\
  \n```json\n[...]\n\"us.zoom.ZoomDaemon\" => {\n    \"AssociatedBundleIdentifiers\" => [\n      0 => \"us.zoom.xos\"\n  \
  \  ]\n    \"Attribution\" => \"Zoom\"\n    \"Program\" => \"/Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/us.zoom.ZoomDaemon\"\n    \"\
  ProgramArguments\" => [\n      0 => \"/Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/us.zoom.ZoomDaemon\"\n    ]\n    \"TeamIdentifier\"\
  \ => \"BJ4HAAB9B3\"\n  }\n[...]\n```\n\n### Enumeration\n\nIt's possible to **enumerate all** the configured background\
  \ items running the Apple cli tool:\n\n```bash\n# The tool will always ask for the users password\nsfltool dumpbtm\n```\n\
  \nMoreover, it's also possible to list this information with [**DumpBTM**](https://github.com/objective-see/DumpBTM).\n\n\
  ```bash\n# You need to grant the Terminal Full Disk Access for this to work\nchmod +x dumpBTM\nxattr -rc dumpBTM # Remove\
  \ quarantine attr\n./dumpBTM\n```\n\nThis information is being stored in **`/private/var/db/com.apple.backgroundtaskmanagement/BackgroundItems-v4.btm`**\
  \ and the Terminal needs FDA.\n\n### Messing with BTM\n\nWhen a new persistence is found an event of type **`ES_EVENT_TYPE_NOTIFY_BTM_LAUNCH_ITEM_ADD`**.\
  \ So, any way to **prevent** this **event** from being sent or the **agent from alerting** the user will help an attacker\
  \ to _**bypass**_ BTM.\n\n- **Reseting the database**: Running the following command will reset the database (should rebuild\
  \ it from the ground), however, for some reason, after running this, **no new persistence will be alerted until the system\
  \ is rebooted**.\n  - **root** is required.\n\n```bash\n# Reset the database\nsfltool resettbtm\n```\n\n- **Stop the Agent**:\
  \ It's possible to send a stop signal to the agent so it **won't be alerting the user** when new detections are found.\n\
  \n```bash\n# Get PID\npgrep BackgroundTaskManagementAgent\n1011\n\n# Stop it\nkill -SIGSTOP 1011\n\n# Check it's stopped\
  \ (a T means it's stopped)\nps -o state 1011\nT\n```\n\n- **Bug**: If the **process that created the persistence exists\
  \ fast right after it**, the daemon will try to **get information** about it, **fail**, and **won't be able to send the\
  \ event** indicating that a new thing is persisting.\n\nReferences and **more information about BTM**:\n\n- [https://youtu.be/9hjUmT031tc?t=26481](https://youtu.be/9hjUmT031tc?t=26481)\n\
