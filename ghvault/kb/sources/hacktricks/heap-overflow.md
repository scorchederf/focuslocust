_body: "# Heap Overflow\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n## Basic Information\n\nA heap overflow is\
  \ like a [**stack overflow**](../stack-overflow/index.html) but in the heap. Basically it means that some space was reserved\
  \ in the heap to store some data and **stored data was bigger than the space reserved.**\n\nIn stack overflows we know that\
  \ some registers like the instruction pointer or the stack frame are going to be restored from the stack and it could be\
  \ possible to abuse this. In case of heap overflows, there **isn't any sensitive information stored by default** in the\
  \ heap chunk that can be overflowed. However, it could be sensitive information or pointers, so the **criticality** of this\
  \ vulnerability **depends** on **which data could be overwritten** and how an attacker could abuse this.\n\n> [!TIP]\n>\
  \ In order to find overflow offsets you can use the same patterns as in [**stack overflows**](../stack-overflow/index.html#finding-stack-overflows-offsets).\n\
  \n### Stack Overflows vs Heap Overflows\n\nIn stack overflows the arranging and data that is going to be present in the\
  \ stack at the moment the vulnerability can be triggered is fairly reliable. This is because the stack is linear, always\
  \ increasing in colliding memory, in **specific places of the program run the stack memory usually stores similar kind of\
  \ data** and it has some specific structure with some pointers at the end of the stack part used by each function.\n\nHowever,\
  \ in the case of a heap overflow, the used memory isn’t linear but **allocated chunks are usually in separated positions\
  \ of memory** (not one next to the other) because of **bins and zones** separating allocations by size and because **previous\
  \ freed memory is used** before allocating new chunks. It’s **complicated to know the object that is going to be colliding\
  \ with the one vulnerable** to a heap overflow. So, when a heap overflow is found, it’s needed to find a **reliable way\
  \ to make the desired object to be next in memory** from the one that can be overflowed.\n\nOne of the techniques used for\
  \ this is **Heap Grooming** which is used for example [**in this post**](https://azeria-labs.com/grooming-the-ios-kernel-heap/).\
  \ In the post it’s explained how when in iOS kernel when a zone run out of memory to store chunks of memory, it expands\
  \ it by a kernel page, and this page is splitted into chunks of the expected sizes which would be used in order (until iOS\
  \ version 9.2, then these chunks are used in a randomised way to difficult the exploitation of these attacks).\n\nTherefore,\
  \ in the previous post where a heap overflow is happening, in order to force the overflowed object to be colliding with\
  \ a victim order, several **`kallocs` are forced by several threads to try to ensure that all the free chunks are filled\
  \ and that a new page is created**.\n\nIn order to force this filling with objects of a specific size, the **out-of-line\
  \ allocation associated with an iOS mach port** is an ideal candidate. By crafting the size of the message, it’s possible\
  \ to exactly specify the size of `kalloc` allocation and when the corresponding mach port is destroyed, the corresponding\
  \ allocation will be immediately released back to `kfree`.\n\nThen, some of these placeholders can be **freed**. The **`kalloc.4096`\
  \ free list releases elements in a last-in-first-out order**, which basically means that if some place holders are freed\
  \ and the exploit try lo allocate several victim objects while trying to allocate the object vulnerable to overflow, it’s\
  \ probable that this object will be followed by a victim object.\n\n### Example libc\n\n[**In this page**](https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/27-edit_free_chunk/heap_consolidation_explanation/index.html)\
  \ it's possible to find a basic Heap overflow emulation that shows how overwriting the prev in use bit of the next chunk\
  \ and the position of the prev size it's possible to **consolidate a used chunk** (by making it thing it's unused) and **then\
  \ allocate it again** being able to overwrite data that is being used in a different pointer also.\n\nAnother example from\
  \ [**protostar heap 0**](https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/24-heap_overflow/protostar_heap0/index.html) shows a very basic\
  \ example of a CTF where a **heap overflow** can be abused to call the winner function to **get the flag**.\n\nIn the [**protostar\
  \ heap 1**](https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/24-heap_overflow/protostar_heap1/index.html) example it's possible to see how\
  \ abusing a buffer overflow it's possible to **overwrite in a near chunk an address** where **arbitrary data from the user**\
  \ is going to be written to.\n\n### Example ARM64\n\nIn the page [https://8ksec.io/arm64-reversing-and-exploitation-part-1-arm-instruction-set-simple-heap-overflow/](https://8ksec.io/arm64-reversing-and-exploitation-part-1-arm-instruction-set-simple-heap-overflow/)\
  \ you can find a heap overflow example where a command that is going to be executed is stored in the following chunk from\
  \ the overflowed chunk. So, it's possible to modify the executed command by overwriting it with an easy exploit such as:\n\
  \n```bash\npython3 -c 'print(\"/\"*0x400+\"/bin/ls\\x00\")' > hax.txt\n```\n\n### Other examples\n\n- [**Auth-or-out. Hack\
  \ The Box**](https://7rocky.github.io/en/ctf/htb-challenges/pwn/auth-or-out/)\n  - We use an Integer Overflow vulnerability\
  \ to get a Heap Overflow.\n  - We corrupt pointers to a function inside a `struct` of the overflowed chunk to set a function\
  \ such as `system` and get code execution.\n\n### Real-World Example: CVE-2025-40597 – Misusing `__sprintf_chk`\n\nIn SonicWall\
  \ SMA100 firmware 10.2.1.15 the reverse-proxy module `mod_httprp.so` allocates an **0x80-byte** heap chunk and then concatenates\
  \ several strings into it with `__sprintf_chk`:\n\n```c\nchar *buf = calloc(0x80, 1);\n/* … */\n__sprintf_chk(buf,     \
  \          /* destination (0x80-byte chunk) */\n              -1,                /* <-- size argument   !!! */\n       \
  \       0,                 /* flags */\n              \"%s%s%s%s\",      /* format */\n              \"/\", \"https://\"\
  , path, host);\n```\n\n`__sprintf_chk` is part of **_FORTIFY_SOURCE**.  When it receives a **positive** `size` parameter\
  \ it verifies that the resulting string fits inside the destination buffer.  By passing **`-1` (0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF)** the\
  \ developers effectively **disabled the bounds check**, turning the fortified call back into a classic, unsafe `sprintf`.\n\
  \nSupplying an overly long **`Host:`** header therefore lets an attacker **overflow the 0x80-byte chunk and clobber the\
  \ metadata of the following heap chunk** (tcache / fast-bin / small-bin depending on the allocator).  A crash can be reproduced\
  \ with:\n\n```python\nimport requests, warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\nrequests.get(\n    'https://TARGET/__api__/',\n\
  \    headers={'Host': 'A'*750},\n    verify=False\n)\n```\n\nPractical exploitation would require **heap grooming** to place\
  \ a controllable object right after the vulnerable chunk, but the root cause highlights two important takeaways:\n\n1. **_FORTIFY_SOURCE\
  \ is not a silver bullet** – misuse can nullify the protection.\n2. Always pass the **correct buffer size** to the `_chk`\
  \ family (or, even better, use `snprintf`).\n\n## References\n* [watchTowr Labs – Stack Overflows, Heap Overflows and Existential\
