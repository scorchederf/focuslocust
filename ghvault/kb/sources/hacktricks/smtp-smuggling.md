_body: "# SMTP Smuggling\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n## Basic Information\n\nThis type of vulnerability\
  \ was [**originally discovered in this post**](https://sec-consult.com/blog/detail/smtp-smuggling-spoofing-e-mails-worldwide/)\
  \ were it's explained that It's possible to **exploit discrepancies in how the SMTP protocol is interpreted** when finalising\
  \ an email, allowing an attacker to smuggle more emails in the body of the legit one, allowing to impersonate other users\
  \ of the affected domain (such as admin@outlook.com) bypassing defenses such as SPF.\n\n### Why\n\nThis is because in the\
  \ SMTP protocol, the **data of the message** to be sent in the email is controlled by a user (attacker) which could send\
  \ specially crafted data abusing differences in parsers that will smuggle extra emails in the receptor. Take a look to this\
  \ illustrated example from the original post:\n\n<figure><img src=\"../../images/image (8) (1) (1) (1) (1).png\" alt=\"\"\
  ><figcaption><p><a href=\"https://sec-consult.com/fileadmin/user_upload/sec-consult/Dynamisch/Blogartikel/2023_12/SMTP_Smuggling-Overview__09_.png\"\

  \n### How\n\nIn order to exploit this vulnerability an attacker needs to send some data that the **Outbound SMPT server\
  \ thinks that it's just 1 email but the Inbound SMTP server thinks that there are several emails**.\n\nThe researchers discovered\
  \ that different **Inboud servers considers different characters as the end of the data** of the email message that Outbound\
  \ servers doesn't.\\\nFor example, a regular end of the data is `\\r\\n.\\r`. But if the Inbound SMTP server also supports\
  \ `\\n.`, an attacker could just add **that data in his email and start indicating the SMTP commands** of a new new ones\
  \ to smuggle it just like in the previous image.\n\nOfc, this could only work if the **Outbound SMTP server doesn't also\
  \ treat this data** as the end of the message data, because in that case it will see 2 emails instead of just 1, so at the\
  \ end this is the desynchronization that is being abused in this vulnerability.\n\nPotential desynchronization data:\n\n\
  - `\\n.`\n- `\\n.\\r`\n\nAlso note that the SPF is bypassed because if you smuggle an email from `admin@outlook.com` from\
  \ an email from `user@outlook.com`, **the sender is still `outlook.com`.**\n\n---\n\n## Attacker’s checklist (what conditions\
  \ must hold?)\n\nTo successfully smuggle a second email, you typically need:\n\n- An outbound server A you can send through\
  \ (often with valid creds) that will forward a non‑standard end‑of‑DATA sequence unchanged. Many services historically forwarded\
  \ variants like `\\n.\\r\\n` or `\\n.\\n`.\n- A receiving server B that will interpret that non‑standard sequence as end‑of‑DATA\
  \ and then parse whatever follows as new SMTP commands (MAIL/RCPT/DATA...).\n- Outbound must actually send with `DATA` (not\
  \ `BDAT`). If A supports CHUNKING/BDAT, smuggling only works if it falls back to DATA (e.g., B doesn’t advertise CHUNKING),\
  \ otherwise length‑framed BDAT prevents ambiguity.\n- PIPELINING isn’t required but helps hiding the injected commands in\
  \ a single TCP write so intermediate devices don’t resynchronize.\n\nCommon end‑of‑DATA variants worth testing (receiver-dependent):\n\
  \n- `\\n.\\n`\n- `\\n.\\r\\n`\n- `\\r.\\r\\n`\n- `\\r\\n.\\r` (bare CR at end)\n\nNote: What works is the intersection of\
  \ “what A forwards” ∩ “what B accepts”.\n\n---\n\n## Manual exploitation example (single session)\n\nThe following shows\
  \ the idea using a raw STARTTLS SMTP session. After the first DATA block we insert a non‑standard terminator, then another\
  \ SMTP dialog that the receiving server may treat as a new message.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Manual smuggling session (STARTTLS)</summary>\n\
  \n```\n$ openssl s_client -starttls smtp -crlf -connect smtp.example.com:587\nEHLO a.example\nAUTH PLAIN <base64(\\0user@example.com\\\
  0password)>\nMAIL FROM:<user@example.com>\nRCPT TO:<victim@target.com>\nDATA\nFrom: User <user@example.com>\nTo: victim\
  \ <victim@target.com>\nSubject: legit\n\nhello A\n\\n.\\r\\nMAIL FROM:<admin@target.com>\nRCPT TO:<victim@target.com>\n\
  DATA\nFrom: Admin <admin@target.com>\nTo: victim <victim@target.com>\nSubject: smuggled\n\nhello B\n\\r\\n.\\r\\n\n```\n\
  \nIf A forwards `\\n.\\r\\n` and B accepts it as end‑of‑DATA, message “hello B” may be accepted as a second email from `admin@target.com`\
  \ while passing SPF (aligned with A’s IPs).\n</details>\n\nTip: When testing interactively, ensure `-crlf` is used so OpenSSL\
  \ preserves CRLF in what you type.\n\n---\n\n## Automation and scanners\n\n- hannob/smtpsmug: send a message ending with\
  \ multiple malformed end‑of‑DATA sequences to see what a receiver accepts.\n  - Example: `./smtpsmug -s mail.target.com\
  \ -p 25 -t victim@target.com`\n- The‑Login/SMTP‑Smuggling‑Tools: scanner for both inbound and outbound sides plus an analysis\
  \ SMTP server to see exactly which sequences survive a sender.\n  - Inbound quick check: `python3 smtp_smuggling_scanner.py\
  \ victim@target.com`\n  - Outbound via a relay: `python3 smtp_smuggling_scanner.py YOUR@ANALYSIS.DOMAIN --outbound-smtp-server\
  \ smtp.relay.com --port 587 --starttls --sender-address you@relay.com --username you@relay.com --password '...'\n`\n\nThese\
  \ tools help you map the A→B pairs where smuggling actually works.\n\n---\n\n## CHUNKING/BDAT vs DATA\n\n- DATA uses a sentinel\
  \ terminator `<CR><LF>.<CR><LF>`; any ambiguity in how CR/LF are normalized or dot‑stuffed leads to desync.\n- CHUNKING\
  \ (BDAT) frames the body with an exact byte length and therefore prevents classic smuggling. However, if the sender falls\
  \ back to DATA (because the receiver doesn’t advertise CHUNKING), classic smuggling becomes possible again.\n\n---\n\n##\
  \ Notes on affected software and fixes (for targeting)\n\n- Postfix: prior to 3.9 the default tolerated bare LFs; from 3.5.23/3.6.13/3.7.9/3.8.4\
  \ admins can enable `smtpd_forbid_bare_newline`. Current recommendation is `smtpd_forbid_bare_newline = normalize` (3.8.5+/3.7.10+/3.6.14+/3.5.24+)\
  \ or set to `reject` for strict RFC enforcement.\n- Exim: fixed in 4.97.1 (and later) for variants relying on mixed end‑of‑DATA\
  \ sequences when DATA is used. Older 4.97/4.96 may be exploitable depending on PIPELINING/CHUNKING.\n- Sendmail: fixed in\
  \ 8.18; older 8.17.x accepted some non‑standard terminators.\n- Various libraries/servers (e.g., aiosmtpd before 1.4.5,\
  \ some vendor gateways, and specific SaaS relays) had similar issues; modern versions tend to accept DATA only with strict\
  \ `<CR><LF>.<CR><LF>`.\n\nUse the scanners above to verify current behavior; many vendors changed defaults in early 2024–2025.\n\
  \n---\n\n## Tips for red team ops\n\n- Favor large commodity senders for A (historically Exchange Online, shared hosters,\
  \ etc.). If they still forward some non‑standard EOM and they’re in the victim’s SPF, your smuggled MAIL FROM will inherit\
  \ their reputation.\n- Enumerate B’s SMTP extensions: `EHLO` banner for PIPELINING/CHUNKING; if CHUNKING is missing you\
  \ have a better chance from BDAT‑first senders. Combine with malformed EOMs to probe acceptance.\n- Watch headers: the smuggled\
  \ message will usually create a separate Received chain starting at B. DMARC will often pass because MAIL FROM aligns with\
  \ A’s IP space.\n\n---\n\n## **References**\n\n- [https://sec-consult.com/blog/detail/smtp-smuggling-spoofing-e-mails-worldwide/](https://sec-consult.com/blog/detail/smtp-smuggling-spoofing-e-mails-worldwide/)\n\
