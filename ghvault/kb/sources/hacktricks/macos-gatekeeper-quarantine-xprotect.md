  \n**Gatekeeper** is a security feature developed for Mac operating systems, designed to ensure that users **run only trusted\
  \ software** on their systems. It functions by **validating software** that a user downloads and attempts to open from **sources\
  \ outside the App Store**, such as an app, a plug-in, or an installer package.\n\nThe key mechanism of Gatekeeper lies in\
  \ its **verification** process. It checks if the downloaded software is **signed by a recognized developer**, ensuring the\
  \ software's authenticity. Further, it ascertains whether the software is **notarised by Apple**, confirming that it is\
  \ devoid of known malicious content and has not been tampered with after notarisation.\n\nAdditionally, Gatekeeper reinforces\
  \ user control and security by **prompting users to approve the opening** of downloaded software for the first time. This\
  \ safeguard helps prevent users from inadvertently running potentially harmful executable code that they may have mistaken\
  \ for a harmless data file.\n\n### Application Signatures\n\nApplication signatures, also known as code signatures, are\
  \ a critical component of Apple's security infrastructure. They're used to **verify the identity of the software author**\
  \ (the developer) and to ensure that the code hasn't been tampered with since it was last signed.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\
  \n1. **Signing the Application:** When a developer is ready to distribute their application, they **sign the application\
  \ using a private key**. This private key is associated with a **certificate that Apple issues to the developer** when they\
  \ enrol in the Apple Developer Program. The signing process involves creating a cryptographic hash of all parts of the app\
  \ and encrypting this hash with the developer's private key.\n2. **Distributing the Application:** The signed application\
  \ is then distributed to users along with the developer's certificate, which contains the corresponding public key.\n3.\
  \ **Verifying the Application:** When a user downloads and attempts to run the application, their Mac operating system uses\
  \ the public key from the developer's certificate to decrypt the hash. It then recalculates the hash based on the current\
  \ state of the application and compares this with the decrypted hash. If they match, it means **the application hasn't been\
  \ modified** since the developer signed it, and the system permits the application to run.\n\nApplication signatures are\
  \ an essential part of Apple's Gatekeeper technology. When a user attempts to **open an application downloaded from the\
  \ internet**, Gatekeeper verifies the application signature. If it's signed with a certificate issued by Apple to a known\
  \ developer and the code hasn't been tampered with, Gatekeeper permits the application to run. Otherwise, it blocks the\
  \ application and alerts the user.\n\nStarting from macOS Catalina, **Gatekeeper also checks whether the application has\
  \ been notarized** by Apple, adding an extra layer of security. The notarization process checks the application for known\
  \ security issues and malicious code, and if these checks pass, Apple adds a ticket to the application that Gatekeeper can\
  \ verify.\n\n#### Check Signatures\n\nWhen checking some **malware sample** you should always **check the signature** of\
  \ the binary as the **developer** that signed it may be already **related** with **malware.**\n\n```bash\n# Get signer\n\
  codesign -vv -d /bin/ls 2>&1 | grep -E \"Authority|TeamIdentifier\"\n\n# Check if the app’s contents have been modified\n\
  codesign --verify --verbose /Applications/Safari.app\n\n# Get entitlements from the binary\ncodesign -d --entitlements :-\
  \ /System/Applications/Automator.app # Check the TCC perms\n\n# Check if the signature is valid\nspctl --assess --verbose\
  \ /Applications/Safari.app\n\n# Sign a binary\ncodesign -s <cert-name-keychain> toolsdemo\n```\n\n### Notarization\n\nApple's\
  \ notarization process serves as an additional safeguard to protect users from potentially harmful software. It involves\
  \ the **developer submitting their application for examination** by **Apple's Notary Service**, which should not be confused\
  \ with App Review. This service is an **automated system** that scrutinizes the submitted software for the presence of **malicious\
  \ content** and any potential issues with code-signing.\n\nIf the software **passes** this inspection without raising any\
  \ concerns, the Notary Service generates a notarization ticket. The developer is then required to **attach this ticket to\
  \ their software**, a process known as 'stapling.' Furthermore, the notarization ticket is also published online where Gatekeeper,\
  \ Apple's security technology, can access it.\n\nUpon the user's first installation or execution of the software, the existence\
  \ of the notarization ticket - whether stapled to the executable or found online - **informs Gatekeeper that the software\
  \ has been notarized by Apple**. As a result, Gatekeeper displays a descriptive message in the initial launch dialog, indicating\
  \ that the software has undergone checks for malicious content by Apple. This process thereby enhances user confidence in\
  \ the security of the software they install or run on their systems.\n\n### spctl & syspolicyd\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n> Note that\
  \ from Sequoia version, **`spctl`** doesn't allow to modify Gatekeeper configuration anymore.\n\n**`spctl`** is the CLI\
  \ tool to enumerate and interact with Gatekeeper (with the `syspolicyd` daemon via XPC messages). For example, it's possible\
  \ to see the **status** of GateKeeper with:\n\n```bash\n# Check the status\nspctl --status\n```\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n> Note\
  \ that GateKeeper signature checks are performed only to **files with the Quarantine attribute**, not to every file.\n\n\
  GateKeeper will check if according to the **preferences & the signature** a binary can be executed:\n\n<figure><img src=\"\
  ../../../images/image (1150).png\" alt=\"\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n**`syspolicyd`** is the main daemon responsible\
  \ to enforcing Gatekeeper. It maintains a database located in `/var/db/SystemPolicy` and it's possible to find the code\
  \ to support the [database here](https://opensource.apple.com/source/Security/Security-58286.240.4/OSX/libsecurity_codesigning/lib/policydb.cpp)\
  \ and the [SQL template here](https://opensource.apple.com/source/Security/Security-58286.240.4/OSX/libsecurity_codesigning/lib/syspolicy.sql).\
  \ Note that the database is unrestricted by SIP and writable by root and the database `/var/db/.SystemPolicy-default` is\
  \ used as an original backup in case the other gets corrupted.\n\nMoreover, the bundles **`/var/db/gke.bundle`** and **`/var/db/gkopaque.bundle`**\
  \ contains files with rules that are inserted in the database. You can check this database as root with:\n\n```bash\n# Open\
  \ database\nsqlite3 /var/db/SystemPolicy\n\n# Get allowed rules\nSELECT requirement,allow,disabled,label from authority\
  \ where label != 'GKE' and disabled=0;\nrequirement|allow|disabled|label\nanchor apple generic and certificate 1[subject.CN]\
  \ = \"Apple Software Update Certification Authority\"|1|0|Apple Installer\nanchor apple|1|0|Apple System\nanchor apple generic\
  \ and certificate leaf[field.1.2.840.113635.100.6.1.9] exists|1|0|Mac App Store\nanchor apple generic and certificate 1[field.1.2.840.113635.100.6.2.6]\
  \ exists and (certificate leaf[field.1.2.840.113635.100.6.1.14] or certificate leaf[field.1.2.840.113635.100.6.1.13]) and\
  \ notarized|1|0|Notarized Developer ID\n[...]\n```\n\n**`syspolicyd`** also exposes a XPC server with different operations\
  \ like `assess`, `update`, `record` and `cancel` which are also reachable using **`Security.framework`'s `SecAssessment*`**\
  \ APIs and **`spctl`** actually talks to **`syspolicyd`** via XPC.\n\nNote how the first rule ended in \"**App Store**\"\
  \ and the second one in \"**Developer ID**\" and that in the previous imaged it was **enabled to execute apps from the App\
  \ Store and identified developers**.\\\nIf you **modify** that setting to App Store, the \"**Notarized Developer ID\" rules\
  \ will disappear**.\n\nThere are also thousands of rules of **type GKE** :\n\n```bash\nSELECT requirement,allow,disabled,label\
  \ from authority where label = 'GKE' limit 5;\ncdhash H\"b40281d347dc574ae0850682f0fd1173aa2d0a39\"|1|0|GKE\ncdhash H\"\
  5fd63f5342ac0c7c0774ebcbecaf8787367c480f\"|1|0|GKE\ncdhash H\"4317047eefac8125ce4d44cab0eb7b1dff29d19a\"|1|0|GKE\ncdhash\
  \ H\"0a71962e7a32f0c2b41ddb1fb8403f3420e1d861\"|1|0|GKE\ncdhash H\"8d0d90ff23c3071211646c4c9c607cdb601cb18f\"|1|0|GKE\n\
  ```\n\nThese are hashes that from:\n\n- `/var/db/SystemPolicyConfiguration/gke.bundle/Contents/Resources/gke.auth`\n- `/var/db/gke.bundle/Contents/Resources/gk.db`\n\
  - `/var/db/gkopaque.bundle/Contents/Resources/gkopaque.db`\n\nOr you could list the previous info with:\n\n```bash\nsudo\
  \ spctl --list\n```\n\nThe options **`--master-disable`** and **`--global-disable`** of **`spctl`** will completely **disable**\
  \ these signature checks:\n\n```bash\n# Disable GateKeeper\nspctl --global-disable\nspctl --master-disable\n\n# Enable it\n\
  spctl --global-enable\nspctl --master-enable\n```\n\nWhen completely enabled, a new option will appear:\n\n<figure><img\
  \ src=\"../../../images/image (1151).png\" alt=\"\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\nIt's possible to **check if an\
  \ App will be allowed by GateKeeper** with:\n\n```bash\nspctl --assess -v /Applications/App.app\n```\n\nIt's possible to\
  \ add new rules in GateKeeper to allow the execution of certain apps with:\n\n```bash\n# Check if allowed - nop\nspctl --assess\
  \ -v /Applications/App.app\n/Applications/App.app: rejected\nsource=no usable signature\n\n# Add a label and allow this\
  \ label in GateKeeper\nsudo spctl --add --label \"whitelist\" /Applications/App.app\nsudo spctl --enable --label \"whitelist\"\
  \n\n# Check again - yep\nspctl --assess -v /Applications/App.app\n/Applications/App.app: accepted\n```\n\nRegarding **kernel\
  \ extensions**, the folder `/var/db/SystemPolicyConfiguration` contains files with lists of kexts allowed to be loaded.\
  \ Moreover, `spctl` has the entitlement `com.apple.private.iokit.nvram-csr` because it's capable of adding new pre-approved\
  \ kernel extensions which need to be saved also in NVRAM in a `kext-allowed-teams` key.\n\n#### Managing Gatekeeper on macOS\
  \ 15 (Sequoia) and later\n\n- The long‑standing Finder **Ctrl+Open / Right‑click → Open** bypass has been removed; users\
  \ must explicitly allow a blocked app from **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Open Anyway** after the first block\
  \ dialog.\n- `spctl --master-disable/--global-disable` are no longer accepted; `spctl` is effectively read‑only for assessment\
  \ and label management while policy enforcement is configured through UI or MDM.\n\nStarting in macOS 15 Sequoia, end users\
  \ can no longer toggle Gatekeeper policy from `spctl`. Management is performed via System Settings or by deploying an MDM\
  \ configuration profile with the `com.apple.systempolicy.control` payload. Example profile snippet to allow App Store and\
  \ identified developers (but not \"Anywhere\"):\n\n<details>\n<summary>MDM profile to allow App Store and identified developers</summary>\n\
  \n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\"\

  \ Files\n\nUpon **downloading** an application or file, specific macOS **applications** such as web browsers or email clients\
  \ **attach an extended file attribute**, commonly known as the \"**quarantine flag**,\" to the downloaded file. This attribute\
  \ acts as a security measure to **mark the file** as coming from an untrusted source (the internet), and potentially carrying\
  \ risks. However, not all applications attach this attribute, for instance, common BitTorrent client software usually bypasses\
  \ this process.\n\n**The presence of a quarantine flag signals macOS's Gatekeeper security feature when a user attempts\
  \ to execute the file**.\n\nIn the case where the **quarantine flag is not present** (as with files downloaded via some\
  \ BitTorrent clients), Gatekeeper's **checks may not be performed**. Thus, users should exercise caution when opening files\
  \ downloaded from less secure or unknown sources.\n\n> [!NOTE] > **Checking** the **validity** of code signatures is a **resource-intensive**\
  \ process that includes generating cryptographic **hashes** of the code and all its bundled resources. Furthermore, checking\
  \ certificate validity involves doing an **online check** to Apple's servers to see if it has been revoked after it was\
  \ issued. For these reasons, a full code signature and notarization check is **impractical to run every time an app is launched**.\n\
  >\n> Therefore, these checks are **only run when executing apps with the quarantined attribute.**\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> This\
  \ attribute must be **set by the application creating/downloading** the file.\n>\n> However, files that are sandboxed will\
  \ have this attribute set to every file they create. And non sandboxed apps can set it themselves, or specify the [**LSFileQuarantineEnabled**](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/lsfilequarantineenabled?language=objc)\
  \ key in the **Info.plist** which will make the system set the `com.apple.quarantine` extended attribute on the files created,\n\
  \nMoreover, all files created by a process calling **`qtn_proc_apply_to_self`** are quarantined. Or the API **`qtn_file_apply_to_path`**\
  \ adds the quarantine attribute to a specified file path.\n\nIt's possible to **check it's status and enable/disable** (root\
  \ required) with:\n\n```bash\nspctl --status\nassessments enabled\n\nspctl --enable\nspctl --disable\n#You can also allow\
  \ nee identifies to execute code using the binary \"spctl\"\n```\n\nYou can also **find if a file has the quarantine extended\
  \ attribute** with:\n\n```bash\nxattr file.png\ncom.apple.macl\ncom.apple.quarantine\n```\n\nCheck the **value** of the\
  \ **extended** **attributes** and find out the app that wrote the quarantine attr with:\n\n```bash\nxattr -l portada.png\n\
  com.apple.macl:\n00000000  03 00 53 DA 55 1B AE 4C 4E 88 9D CA B7 5C 50 F3  |..S.U..LN.....P.|\n00000010  16 94 03 00 27\

  \ file with\nfind . -iname '*' -print0 | xargs -0 xattr -d com.apple.quarantine\n```\n\nAnd find all the quarantined files\
  \ with:\n\n```bash\nfind / -exec ls -ld {} \\; 2>/dev/null | grep -E \"[x\\-]@ \" | awk '{printf $9; printf \"\\n\"}' |\
  \ xargs -I {} xattr -lv {} | grep \"com.apple.quarantine\"\n```\n\nQuarantine information is also stored in a central database\
  \ managed by LaunchServices in **`~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices.QuarantineEventsV2`** which allows the\
  \ GUI to obtain data about the file origins. Moreover this can be overwritten by applications which might be interested\
  \ in hiding its origins. Moreover, this can be done from LaunchServices APIS.\n\n#### **libquarantine.dylib**\n\nThis library\
  \ exports several functions that allow to manipulate the extended attribute fields.\n\nThe `qtn_file_*` APIs deal with file\
  \ quarantine policies, the `qtn_proc_*` APIs are applied to processes (files created by the process). The unexported `__qtn_syscall_quarantine*`\
  \ functions are the ones that applies the policies which calls `mac_syscall` with \"Quarantine\" as first argument which\
  \ sends the requests to `Quarantine.kext`.\n\n#### **Quarantine.kext**\n\nThe kernel extension is only available through\
  \ the **kernel cache on the system**; however, you _can_ download the **Kernel Debug Kit from** [**https://developer.apple.com/**](https://developer.apple.com/),\
  \ which will contain a symbolicated version of the extension.\n\nThis Kext will hook via MACF several calls in order to\
  \ traps all file lifecycle events: Creation, opening, renaming, hard-linkning... even `setxattr` to prevent it from setting\
  \ the `com.apple.quarantine` extended attribute.\n\nIt also uses a couple of MIBs:\n\n- `security.mac.qtn.sandbox_enforce`:\
  \ Enforce quarantine along Sandbox\n- `security.mac.qtn.user_approved_exec`: Querantined procs can only execute approved\
  \ files\n\n#### Provenance xattr (Ventura and later)\n\nmacOS 13 Ventura introduced a separate provenance mechanism which\
  \ is populated the first time a quarantined app is allowed to run. Two artefacts are created:\n\n- The `com.apple.provenance`\
  \ xattr on the `.app` bundle directory (fixed-size binary value containing a primary key and flags).\n- A row in the `provenance_tracking`\
  \ table inside the ExecPolicy database at `/var/db/SystemPolicyConfiguration/ExecPolicy/` storing the app’s cdhash and metadata.\n\
  \nPractical usage:\n\n```bash\n# Inspect provenance xattr (if present)\nxattr -p com.apple.provenance /Applications/Some.app\
  \ | hexdump -C\n\n# Observe Gatekeeper/provenance events in real time\nlog stream --style syslog --predicate 'process ==\
  \ \"syspolicyd\"'\n\n# Retrieve historical Gatekeeper decisions for a specific bundle\nlog show --last 2d --style syslog\
  \ --predicate 'process == \"syspolicyd\" && eventMessage CONTAINS[cd] \"GK scan\"'\n```\n\n### XProtect\n\nXProtect is a\
  \ built-in **anti-malware** feature in macOS. XProtect **checks any application when it's first launched or modified against\
  \ its database** of known malware and unsafe file types. When you download a file through certain apps, such as Safari,\
  \ Mail, or Messages, XProtect automatically scans the file. If it matches any known malware in its database, XProtect will\
  \ **prevent the file from running** and alert you to the threat.\n\nThe XProtect database is **updated regularly** by Apple\
  \ with new malware definitions, and these updates are automatically downloaded and installed on your Mac. This ensures that\
  \ XProtect is always up-to-date with the latest known threats.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that **XProtect isn't a full-featured\
  \ antivirus solution**. It only checks for a specific list of known threats and doesn't perform on-access scanning like\
  \ most antivirus software.\n\nYou can get information about the latest XProtect update running:\n\n```bash\nsystem_profiler\
  \ SPInstallHistoryDataType 2>/dev/null | grep -A 4 \"XProtectPlistConfigData\" | tail -n 5\n```\n\nXProtect is located on.\
  \ SIP protected location at **/Library/Apple/System/Library/CoreServices/XProtect.bundle** and inside the bundle you can\
  \ find information XProtect uses:\n\n- **`XProtect.bundle/Contents/Resources/LegacyEntitlementAllowlist.plist`**: Allows\
  \ code with those cdhashes to use legacy entitlements.\n- **`XProtect.bundle/Contents/Resources/XProtect.meta.plist`**:\
  \ List of plugins and extensions that are disallowed to load via BundleID and TeamID or indicating a minimum version.\n\
  - **`XProtect.bundle/Contents/Resources/XProtect.yara`**: Yara rules to detect malware.\n- **`XProtect.bundle/Contents/Resources/gk.db`**:\
  \ SQLite3 database with hashes of blocked applications and TeamIDs.\n\nNote that there is another App in **`/Library/Apple/System/Library/CoreServices/XProtect.app`**\
  \ related to XProtect that isn't involved with the Gatekeeper process.\n\n> XProtect Remediator: On modern macOS, Apple\
  \ ships on-demand scanners (XProtect Remediator) that run periodically via launchd to detect and remediate families of malware.\
  \ You can observe these scans in unified logs:\n>\n> ```bash\n> log show --last 2h --predicate 'subsystem == \"com.apple.XProtectFramework\"\
  \ || category CONTAINS \"XProtect\"' --style syslog\n> ```\n\n### Not Gatekeeper\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n> Note that Gatekeeper\
  \ **isn't executed every time** you execute an application, just _**AppleMobileFileIntegrity**_ (AMFI) will only **verify\
  \ executable code signatures** when you execute an app that has been already executed and verified by Gatekeeper.\n\nTherefore,\
  \ previously it was possible to execute an app to cache it with Gatekeeper, then **modify not executables files of the application**\
  \ (like Electron asar or NIB files) and if no other protections were in place, the application was **executed** with the\
  \ **malicious** additions.\n\nHowever, now this is not possible because macOS **prevents modifying files** inside applications\
  \ bundles. So, if you try the [Dirty NIB](../macos-proces-abuse/macos-dirty-nib.md) attack, you will find that it's not\
  \ longer possible to abuse it because after executing the app to cache it with Gatekeeper, you won't be able to modify the\
  \ bundle. And if you change for example the name of the Contents directory to NotCon (as indicated in the exploit), and\
  \ then execute the main binary of the app to cache it with Gatekeeper, it will trigger an error and won't execute.\n\n##\
  \ Gatekeeper Bypasses\n\nAny way to bypass Gatekeeper (manage to make the user download something and execute it when Gatekeeper\
  \ should disallow it) is considered a vulnerability in macOS. These are some CVEs assigned to techniques that allowed to\
  \ bypass Gatekeeper in the past:\n\n### [CVE-2021-1810](https://labs.withsecure.com/publications/the-discovery-of-cve-2021-1810)\n\
  \nIt was observed that if the **Archive Utility** is used for extraction, files with **paths exceeding 886 characters**\
  \ do not receive the com.apple.quarantine extended attribute. This situation inadvertently allows those files to **circumvent\
  \ Gatekeeper's** security checks.\n\nCheck the [**original report**](https://labs.withsecure.com/publications/the-discovery-of-cve-2021-1810)\
  \ for more information.\n\n### [CVE-2021-30990](https://ronmasas.com/posts/bypass-macos-gatekeeper)\n\nWhen an application\
  \ is created with **Automator**, the information about what it needs to execute is inside `application.app/Contents/document.wflow`\
  \ not in the executable. The executable is just a generic Automator binary called **Automator Application Stub**.\n\nTherefore,\
  \ you could make `application.app/Contents/MacOS/Automator\\ Application\\ Stub` **point with a symbolic link to another\
  \ Automator Application Stub inside the system** and it will execute what is inside `document.wflow` (you script) **without\
  \ triggering Gatekeeper** because the actual executable doesn't have the quarantine xattr.\n\nExample os expected location:\
  \ `/System/Library/CoreServices/Automator\\ Application\\ Stub.app/Contents/MacOS/Automator\\ Application\\ Stub`\n\nCheck\
  \ the [**original report**](https://ronmasas.com/posts/bypass-macos-gatekeeper) for more information.\n\n### [CVE-2022-22616](https://www.jamf.com/blog/jamf-threat-labs-safari-vuln-gatekeeper-bypass/)\n\
  \nIn this bypass a zip file was created with an application starting to compress from `application.app/Contents` instead\
  \ of `application.app`. Therefore, the **quarantine attr** was applied to all the **files from `application.app/Contents`**\
  \ but **not to `application.app`**, which is was Gatekeeper was checking, so Gatekeeper was bypassed because when `application.app`\
  \ was triggered it **didn't have the quarantine attribute.**\n\n```bash\nzip -r test.app/Contents test.zip\n```\n\nCheck\
  \ the [**original report**](https://www.jamf.com/blog/jamf-threat-labs-safari-vuln-gatekeeper-bypass/) for more information.\n\
  \n### [CVE-2022-32910](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-32910)\n\nEven if the components are different\
  \ the exploitation of this vulnerability is very similar to the previous one. In this case with will generate an Apple Archive\
  \ from **`application.app/Contents`** so **`application.app` won't get the quarantine attr** when decompressed by **Archive\
  \ Utility**.\n\n```bash\naa archive -d test.app/Contents -o test.app.aar\n```\n\nCheck the [**original report**](https://www.jamf.com/blog/jamf-threat-labs-macos-archive-utility-vulnerability/)\
  \ for more information.\n\n### [CVE-2022-42821](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/12/19/gatekeepers-achilles-heel-unearthing-a-macos-vulnerability/)\n\
  \nThe ACL **`writeextattr`** can be used to prevent anyone from writing an attribute in a file:\n\n```bash\ntouch /tmp/no-attr\n\
  chmod +a \"everyone deny writeextattr\" /tmp/no-attr\nxattr -w attrname vale /tmp/no-attr\nxattr: [Errno 13] Permission\
  \ denied: '/tmp/no-attr'\n```\n\nMoreover, **AppleDouble** file format copies a file including its ACEs.\n\nIn the [**source\
  \ code**](https://opensource.apple.com/source/Libc/Libc-391/darwin/copyfile.c.auto.html) it's possible to see that the ACL\
  \ text representation stored inside the xattr called **`com.apple.acl.text`** is going to be set as ACL in the decompressed\
  \ file. So, if you compressed an application into a zip file with **AppleDouble** file format with an ACL that prevents\
  \ other xattrs to be written to it... the quarantine xattr wasn't set into de application:\n\n```bash\nchmod +a \"everyone\
  \ deny write,writeattr,writeextattr\" /tmp/test\nditto -c -k test test.zip\npython3 -m http.server\n# Download the zip from\
  \ the browser and decompress it, the file should be without a quarantine xattr\n```\n\nCheck the [**original report**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/12/19/gatekeepers-achilles-heel-unearthing-a-macos-vulnerability/)\
  \ for more information.\n\nNote that this could also be be exploited with AppleArchives:\n\n```bash\nmkdir app\ntouch app/test\n\
  chmod +a \"everyone deny write,writeattr,writeextattr\" app/test\naa archive -d app -o test.aar\n```\n\n### [CVE-2023-27943](https://blog.f-secure.com/discovery-of-gatekeeper-bypass-cve-2023-27943/)\n\
  \nIt was discovered that **Google Chrome wasn't setting the quarantine attribute** to downloaded files because of some macOS\
  \ internal problems.\n\n### [CVE-2023-27951](https://redcanary.com/blog/gatekeeper-bypass-vulnerabilities/)\n\nAppleDouble\
  \ file formats store the attributes of a file in a separate file starting by `._`, this helps to copy dile attributes **across\
  \ macOS machines**. However, it was noticed that after decompressing an AppleDouble file, the file starting with `._` **wasn't\
  \ given the quarantine attribute**.\n\n```bash\nmkdir test\necho a > test/a\necho b > test/b\necho ._a > test/._a\naa archive\
  \ -d test/ -o test.aar\n\n# If you downloaded the resulting test.aar and decompress it, the file test/._a won't have a quarantitne\
  \ attribute\n```\n\nBeing able to create a file that won't have the quarantine attribute set, it was **possible to bypass\
  \ Gatekeeper.** The trick was to **create a DMG file application** using the AppleDouble name convention (start it with\
  \ `._`) and create a **visible file as a sym link to this hidden** file without the quarantine attribute.\\\nWhen the **dmg\
  \ file is executed**, as it doesn't have a quarantine attribute it'll **bypass Gatekeeper**.\n\n```bash\n# Create an app\
  \ bundle with the backdoor an call it app.app\n\necho \"[+] creating disk image with app\"\nhdiutil create -srcfolder app.app\
  \ app.dmg\n\necho \"[+] creating directory and files\"\nmkdir\nmkdir -p s/app\ncp app.dmg s/app/._app.dmg\nln -s ._app.dmg\
  \ s/app/app.dmg\n\necho \"[+] compressing files\"\naa archive -d s/ -o app.aar\n```\n\n### [CVE-2023-41067]\n\nA Gatekeeper\
  \ bypass fixed in macOS Sonoma 14.0 allowed crafted apps to run without prompting. Details were disclosed publicly after\
  \ patching and the issue was actively exploited in the wild before fix. Ensure Sonoma 14.0 or later is installed.\n\n###\
  \ [CVE-2024-27853]\n\nA Gatekeeper bypass in macOS 14.4 (released March 2024) stemming from `libarchive` handling of malicious\
  \ ZIPs allowed apps to evade assessment. Update to 14.4 or later where Apple addressed the issue.\n\n### [CVE-2024-44128](https://support.apple.com/en-us/121234)\n\
  \nAn **Automator Quick Action workflow** embedded in a downloaded app could trigger without Gatekeeper assessment, because\
  \ workflows were treated as data and executed by the Automator helper outside the normal notarization prompt path. A crafted\
  \ `.app` bundling a Quick Action that runs a shell script (e.g., inside `Contents/PlugIns/*.workflow/Contents/document.wflow`)\
  \ could therefore execute immediately on launch. Apple added an extra consent dialog and fixed the assessment path in Ventura\
  \ **13.7**, Sonoma **14.7**, and Sequoia **15**.\n\n### Third‑party unarchivers mis‑propagating quarantine (2023–2024)\n\
  \nSeveral vulnerabilities in popular extraction tools (e.g., The Unarchiver) caused files extracted from archives to miss\
  \ the `com.apple.quarantine` xattr, enabling Gatekeeper bypass opportunities. Always rely on macOS Archive Utility or patched\
  \ tools when testing, and validate xattrs after extraction.\n\n### uchg (from this [talk](https://codeblue.jp/2023/result/pdf/cb23-bypassing-macos-security-and-privacy-mechanisms-from-gatekeeper-to-system-integrity-protection-by-koh-nakagawa.pdf))\n\
  \n- Create a directory containing an app.\n- Add uchg to the app.\n- Compress the app to a tar.gz file.\n- Send the tar.gz\
  \ file to a victim.\n- The victim opens the tar.gz file and runs the app.\n- Gatekeeper does not check the app.\n\n### Prevent\
