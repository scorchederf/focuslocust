_body: "# Flutter\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\nFlutter is **Google’s cross-platform UI toolkit**\
  \ that lets developers write a single Dart code-base which the **Engine** (native C/C++) turns into platform-specific machine\
  \ code for Android & iOS.  \nThe Engine bundles a **Dart VM**, **BoringSSL**, Skia, etc., and ships as the shared library\
  \ **libflutter.so** (Android) or **Flutter.framework** (iOS). All actual networking (DNS, sockets, TLS) happens **inside\
  \ this library**, *not* in the usual Java/Kotlin Swift/Obj-C layers. That siloed design is why the usual Java-level Frida\
  \ hooks fail on Flutter apps.\n\n## Intercepting HTTPS traffic in Flutter\n\nThis is a summary of this [blog post](https://sensepost.com/blog/2025/intercepting-https-communication-in-flutter-going-full-hardcore-mode-with-frida/).\n\
  \n### Why HTTPS interception is tricky in Flutter  \n* **SSL/TLS verification lives two layers down** in BoringSSL, so Java\
  \ SSL‐pinning bypasses don’t touch it.  \n* **BoringSSL uses its *own* CA store** inside libflutter.so; importing your Burp/ZAP\
  \ CA into Android’s system store changes nothing.  \n* Symbols in libflutter.so are **stripped & mangled**, hiding the certificate-verification\
  \ function from dynamic tools.\n\n### Fingerprint the exact Flutter stack  \nKnowing the version lets you re-build or pattern-match\
  \ the right binaries.\n\nStep | Command / File | Outcome\n----|----|----\nGet snapshot hash | `python3 get_snapshot_hash.py\
  \ libapp.so` | `adb4292f3ec25…`\nMap hash → Engine | **enginehash** list in reFlutter | Flutter 3 · 7 · 12 + engine commit\
  \ `1a65d409…`\nPull dependent commits | DEPS file in that engine commit | • `dart_revision` → Dart v2 · 19 · 6<br>• `dart_boringssl_rev`\
  \ → BoringSSL `87f316d7…`\n\nFind [get_snapshot_hash.py here](https://github.com/Impact-I/reFlutter/blob/main/scripts/get_snapshot_hash.py).\n\
  \n### Target: `ssl_crypto_x509_session_verify_cert_chain()`  \n* Located in **`ssl_x509.cc`** inside BoringSSL.  \n* **Returns\
  \ `bool`** – a single `true` is enough to bypass the whole certificate chain check.  \n* Same function exists on every CPU\
  \ arch; only the opcodes differ.\n\n### Option A – Binary patching with **reFlutter**  \n1. **Clone** the exact Engine &\
  \ Dart sources for the app’s Flutter version.\n2. **Regex-patch** two hotspots:\n   * In `ssl_x509.cc`, force `return 1;`\
  \  \n   * (Optional) In `socket_android.cc`, hard-code a proxy (`\"10.0.2.2:8080\"`).\n3. **Re-compile** libflutter.so,\
  \ drop it back into the APK/IPA, sign, install.\n4. **Pre-patched builds** for common versions are shipped in the reFlutter\
  \ GitHub releases to save hours of build time.\n\n### Option B – Live hooking with **Frida** (the “hard-core” path)  \n\
  Because the symbol is stripped, you pattern-scan the loaded module for its first bytes, then change the return value on\
  \ the fly.\n\n```javascript\n// attach & locate libflutter.so\nvar flutter = Process.getModuleByName(\"libflutter.so\");\n\
  \n// x86-64 pattern of the first 16 bytes of ssl_crypto_x509_session_verify_cert_chain\nvar sig = \"55 41 57 41 56 41 55\
  \ 41 54 53 48 83 EC 38 C6 02\";\n\nMemory.scan(flutter.base, flutter.size, sig, {\n  onMatch: function (addr) {\n    console.log(\"\
  [+] found verifier at \" + addr);\n    Interceptor.attach(addr, {\n      onLeave: function (retval) { retval.replace(0x1);\
  \ }  // always 'true'\n    });\n  },\n  onComplete: function () { console.log(\"scan done\"); }\n});\n```\n\nRun it:\n\n\
  ```bash\nfrida -U -f com.example.app -l bypass.js\n```\n\n*Porting tips*  \n* For **arm64-v8a** or **armv7**, grab the first\
  \ ~32 bytes of the function from Ghidra, convert to a space-separated hex string, and replace `sig`.  \n* Keep **one pattern\
  \ per Flutter release**, store them in a cheat-sheet for fast reuse.\n\n### Forcing traffic through your proxy  \nFlutter\
  \ itself **ignores device proxy settings**. Easiest options:  \n* **Android Studio emulator:** Settings ▶ Proxy → manual.\
  \  \n* **Physical device:** evil Wi-Fi AP + DNS spoofing, or Magisk module editing `/etc/hosts`.\n\n### Quick Flutter TLS\
  \ bypass workflow (Frida Codeshare + system CA)  \nWhen you only need to observe a pinned Flutter API, combining a rooted/writable\
  \ AVD, a system-trusted proxy CA, and a drop-in Frida script is often faster than reverse-engineering libflutter.so:\n\n\
  1. **Install your proxy CA in the system store.** Follow [Install Burp Certificate](install-burp-certificate.md) to hash/rename\
  \ Burp's DER certificate and push it into `/system/etc/security/cacerts/` (writable `/system` required).\n\n2. **Drop a\
  \ matching `frida-server` binary and run it as root** so it can attach to the Flutter process:\n\n```bash\nadb push frida-server-17.0.5-android-x86_64\
  \ /data/local/tmp/frida-server\nadb shell \"su -c 'chmod 755 /data/local/tmp/frida-server && /data/local/tmp/frida-server\
  \ &'\"\n```\n\n3. **Install the host-side tooling and enumerate the target package.**\n\n```bash\npip3 install frida-tools\
  \ --break-system-packages\nadb shell pm list packages -f | grep target\n```\n\n4. **Spawn the Flutter app with the Codeshare\
  \ hook that neuters BoringSSL pin checks.**\n\n```bash\nfrida -U -f com.example.target --codeshare TheDauntless/disable-flutter-tls-v1\
  \ --no-pause\n```\n\nThe Codeshare script overrides the Flutter TLS verifier so every certificate (including Burp's dynamically\
  \ generated ones) is accepted, side-stepping public-key pin comparisons.\n\n5. **Route traffic through your proxy.** Configure\
  \ the emulator Wi-Fi proxy GUI or enforce it via `adb shell settings put global http_proxy 10.0.2.2:8080`; if direct routing\
  \ fails, fall back to `adb reverse tcp:8080 tcp:8080` or a host-only VPN.\n\n6. **If the app ignores OS proxy settings,\
  \ redirect sockets with a Frida shim.** Tools like **frida4burp** hook `dart:io`/BoringSSL socket creation to force outbound\
  \ TCP sessions to your proxy, even with hardcoded `HttpClient.findProxyFromEnvironment` or Wi‑Fi bypasses. Set the proxy\
  \ host/port in the script and run it alongside the TLS bypass:\n\n```bash\nfrida -U -f com.example.target --no-pause \\\n\
  \  --codeshare TheDauntless/disable-flutter-tls-v1 \\\n  -l frida4burp.js\n```\n\nWorks on iOS via a Frida gadget or USB\
  \ frida-server; chaining the socket redirect with the TLS bypass restores both routing and certificate acceptance for Burp/mitmproxy.\n\
  \nOnce the CA is trusted at the OS layer and Frida quashes Flutter's pinning logic (plus socket redirection if needed),\
  \ Burp/mitmproxy regains full visibility for API fuzzing (BOLA, token tampering, etc.) without repacking the APK.\n\n###\
  \ Offset-based hook of BoringSSL verification (no signature scan)\nWhen pattern-based scripts fail across architectures\
  \ (e.g., x86_64 vs ARM), directly hook the BoringSSL chain verifier by absolute address within libflutter.so. Workflow:\n\
  \n- Extract the right-ABI library from the APK: `unzip -j app.apk \"lib/*/libflutter.so\" -d libs/` and pick the one matching\
  \ the device (e.g., `lib/x86_64/libflutter.so`).\n- Analyze in Ghidra/IDA and locate the verifier:\n  - Source: BoringSSL\
  \ ssl_x509.cc function `ssl_crypto_x509_session_verify_cert_chain` (3 args, returns bool).\n  - In stripped builds, use\
  \ **Search → For Strings → `ssl_client` → XREFs**, then open each referenced `FUN_...` and pick the one with 3 pointer-like\
  \ args and a boolean return.\n- Compute the runtime offset: take the function address shown by Ghidra and subtract the image\
  \ base (e.g., Ghidra often shows `0x00100000` for PIE Android ELFs). Example: `0x02184644 - 0x00100000 = 0x02084644`.\n\
  - Hook at runtime by base + offset and force success:\n\n```javascript\n// frida -U -f com.target.app -l bypass.js --no-pause\n\
  const base = Module.findBaseAddress('libflutter.so');\n// Example offset from analysis. Recompute per build/arch.\nconst\
  \ off  = ptr('0x02084644');\nconst addr = base.add(off);\n\n// ssl_crypto_x509_session_verify_cert_chain: 3 args, bool return\n\
  Interceptor.replace(addr, new NativeCallback(function (a, b, c) {\n  return 1; // true\n}, 'int', ['pointer', 'pointer',\
  \ 'pointer']));\n\nconsole.log('[+] Hooked BoringSSL verify_cert_chain at', addr);\n```\n\nNotes\n- Signature scans can\
  \ succeed on ARM but miss on x86_64 because the opcode layout changes; this offset method is architecture-agnostic as long\
  \ as you recalc the RVA.\n- This bypass causes BoringSSL to accept any chain, enabling HTTPS MITM regardless of pins/CA\
  \ trust inside Flutter.\n- If you force-route traffic during debugging to confirm TLS blocking, e.g.:\n\n```bash\niptables\
  \ -t nat -A OUTPUT -p tcp -j DNAT --to-destination <Burp_IP>:<Burp_Port>\n```\n\n…you will still need the hook above, since\
  \ verification happens inside libflutter.so, not Android’s system trust store.\n\n## References\n- [https://sensepost.com/blog/2025/intercepting-https-communication-in-flutter-going-full-hardcore-mode-with-frida/](https://sensepost.com/blog/2025/intercepting-https-communication-in-flutter-going-full-hardcore-mode-with-frida/)\n\
