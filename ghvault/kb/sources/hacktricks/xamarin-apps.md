_body: "# Xamarin Apps\n\n{{#include ../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n## **Basic Information**\n\nXamarin is an **open-source\
  \ platform** designed for developers to **build apps for iOS, Android, and Windows** using the .NET and C# frameworks. This\
  \ platform offers access to numerous tools and extensions to create modern applications efficiently.\n\n### Xamarin's Architecture\n\
  \n- For **Android**, Xamarin integrates with Android and Java namespaces through .NET bindings, operating within the Mono\
  \ execution environment alongside the Android Runtime (ART). Managed Callable Wrappers (MCW) and Android Callable Wrappers\
  \ (ACW) facilitate communication between Mono and ART, both of which are built on the Linux kernel.\n- For **iOS**, applications\
  \ run under the Mono runtime, utilizing full Ahead of Time (AOT) compilation to convert C# .NET code into ARM assembly language.\
  \ This process runs alongside the Objective-C Runtime on a UNIX-like kernel.\n\n### .NET Runtime and Mono Framework\n\n\
  The **.NET framework** includes assemblies, classes, and namespaces for application development, with the .NET Runtime managing\
  \ code execution. It offers platform independence and backward compatibility. The **Mono Framework** is an open-source version\
  \ of the .NET framework, initiated in 2005 to extend .NET to Linux, now supported by Microsoft and led by Xamarin.\n\n###\
  \ Reverse Engineering Xamarin Apps\n\n#### Decompilation of Xamarin Assemblies\n\nDecompilation transforms compiled code\
  \ back into source code. In Windows, the Modules window in Visual Studio can identify modules for decompilation, allowing\
  \ for direct access to third-party code and extraction of source code for analysis.\n\n#### JIT vs AOT Compilation\n\n-\
  \ **Android** supports Just-In-Time (JIT) and Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) compilation, with a Hybrid AOT mode for optimal execution\
  \ speed. Full AOT is exclusive to Enterprise licenses.\n- **iOS** solely employs AOT compilation due to Apple's restrictions\
  \ on dynamic code execution.\n\n### Extracting dll Files from APK/IPA\n\nTo access the assemblies in an APK/IPA, unzip the\
  \ file and explore the assemblies directory. For Android, tools like [XamAsmUnZ](https://github.com/cihansol/XamAsmUnZ)\
  \ and [xamarin-decompress](https://github.com/NickstaDB/xamarin-decompress) can uncompress dll files.\n\n```bash\npython3\
  \ xamarin-decompress.py -o /path/to/decompressed/apk\n```\n\nIn cases where after decompiling the APK it's possible to see\
  \ the unknown/assemblies/ folder with the `.dll` files inside it, it's possible to use [**dnSpy**](https://github.com/dnSpy/dnSpy)\
  \ directly over the `.dlls` to analyze them. However, sometimes the `assemblies.blob` and `assemblies.manifest` files are\
  \ inside the unknown/assemblies/ folder. The tool [pyxamstore](https://github.com/jakev/pyxamstore) can unpack the `assemblies.blob`\
  \ file in Xamarin apps, allowing access to the .NET assemblies for further analysis:\n\n```bash\npyxamstore unpack -d /path/to/decompressed/apk/assemblies/\n\
  # After patching DLLs, rebuild the store\npyxamstore pack\n```\n\n#### .NET MAUI 9 / .NET for Android assembly stores inside\
  \ ELF `.so`\n\nRecent Android MAUI 9 builds no longer expose `assemblies.blob` directly. Instead, each ABI ships an ELF\
  \ container such as `lib/arm64-v8a/libassemblies.arm64-v8a.blob.so`. This is a valid shared library with a custom `payload`\
  \ section that contains the managed assembly store.\n\nQuick workflow:\n\n```bash\nunzip app.apk -d app_unpacked\nllvm-readelf\
  \ --section-headers app_unpacked/lib/arm64-v8a/libassemblies.arm64-v8a.blob.so\nllvm-objcopy --dump-section=payload=payload.bin\
  \ \\\n  app_unpacked/lib/arm64-v8a/libassemblies.arm64-v8a.blob.so\nhexdump -c -n 4 payload.bin   # XABA\n```\n\nIf `llvm-readelf`\
  \ shows a `payload` section, dump it and verify the extracted blob starts with `XABA` (`0x41424158`). That payload is the\
  \ assembly store documented by .NET for Android, not a single DLL.\n\nThe store layout is useful when you need to carve\
  \ assemblies manually or validate an extractor:\n\n- Header: `struct.unpack('<5I', ...)` for `magic`, `version`, `entry_count`,\
  \ `index_entry_count`, `index_size`\n- Descriptors: `entry_count` records of `struct.unpack('<7I', ...)` with `data_offset`\
  \ / `data_size` and optional debug/config offsets\n- Index: skip `index_size` bytes\n- Names: `uint32 length` + UTF-8 bytes\n\
  - Data: seek to each `data_offset` and write `data_size` bytes as `<name>.dll`\n\nSome extracted entries still won't open\
  \ directly in dnSpy/ILSpy/dotPeek because they are additionally wrapped with **XALZ**. In that case:\n\n- Check the first\
  \ 4 bytes of each extracted file for `XALZ`\n- Read the uncompressed size from bytes `8:12` as little-endian `uint32`\n\
  - Decompress bytes `12:` with `lz4.block.decompress(...)`\n\nMinimal decompression logic:\n\n```python\nimport struct\n\
  import lz4.block\n\ndef decompress_xalz(data):\n    size = struct.unpack('<I', data[8:12])[0]\n    return lz4.block.decompress(data[12:],\
  \ uncompressed_size=size)\n```\n\nIf you don't want to parse the store manually, [pymauistore](https://github.com/mwalkowski/pymauistore/tree/main)\
  \ automates ELF payload extraction, `XABA` store parsing, and `XALZ` decompression for MAUI 9 APKs.\n\nSome older Xamarin/MAUI\
  \ builds store compressed assemblies using the **XALZ** format inside `/assemblies.blob` or `/resources/assemblies`. You\
  \ can quickly decompress them with the [xamarout](https://pypi.org/project/xamarout/) library:\n\n```python\nfrom xamarout\
  \ import xalz\nimport os\nfor root, _, files in os.walk(\".\"):\n    for f in files:\n        if open(os.path.join(root,\
  \ f), 'rb').read(4) == b\"XALZ\":\n            xa = xalz.XamarinCompressedAssembly(os.path.join(root, f))\n            xa.write(\"\
  decompressed/\" + f)\n```\n\niOS dll files are readily accessible for decompilation, revealing significant portions of the\
  \ application code, which often shares a common base across different platforms.\n\n> **AOT on iOS**: managed IL is compiled\
  \ into native `*.aotdata.*` files. Patching the DLL alone will not change logic; you need to hook native stubs (e.g., with\
  \ Frida) because the IL bodies are empty placeholders.\n\n### Static Analysis\n\nOnce the `.dll`s are obtained it's possible\
  \ to analyze the .Net code statically using tools such as [**dnSpy**](https://github.com/dnSpy/dnSpy) or [**ILSpy**](https://github.com/icsharpcode/ILSpy)\
  \ that will allow modifying the code of the app. This can be super useful to tamper the application to bypass protections\
  \ for example.\\\nNote that after modifying the app you will need to pack it back again and sign it again.\n\n> dnSpy is\
  \ archived; maintained forks like **dnSpyEx** keep working with .NET 8/MAUI assemblies and preserve debug symbols when re-saving.\n\
  \n### Dynamic Analysis\n\nDynamic analysis involves checking for SSL pinning and using tools like [Fridax](https://github.com/NorthwaveSecurity/fridax)\
  \ for runtime modifications of the .NET binary in Xamarin apps. Frida scripts are available to bypass root detection or\
  \ SSL pinning, enhancing analysis capabilities.\n\nOther interesting Frida scripts:\n\n- [**xamarin-antiroot**](https://codeshare.frida.re/@Gand3lf/xamarin-antiroot/)\n\
  - [**xamarin-root-detect-bypass**](https://codeshare.frida.re/@nuschpl/xamarin-root-detect-bypass/)\n- [**Frida-xamarin-unpin**](https://github.com/GoSecure/frida-xamarin-unpin)\n\
  \nUpdated **Frida-xamarin-unpin** (Mono >=6) hooks `System.Net.Http.HttpClient.SendAsync` and swaps the handler to a permissive\
  \ one, so it still works even when pinning is implemented in custom handlers. Run it after the app starts:\n\n```bash\n\
  frida -U -l dist/xamarin-unpin.js com.target.app --no-pause\n```\n\nQuick template to hook managed methods with the bundled\
  \ `frida-mono-api`:\n\n```javascript\nconst mono = require('frida-mono-api');\nMono.ensureInitialized();\nMono.enumerateLoadedImages().forEach(i\
  \ => console.log(i.name));\nconst klass = Mono.classFromName(\"Namespace\", \"Class\");\nconst m = Mono.methodFromName(klass,\
  \ \"Method\", 2);\nMono.intercept(m, { onEnter(args){ console.log(args[1].toInt32()); } });\n```\n\n### Resigning\n\nThe\
  \ tool [Uber APK Signer](https://github.com/patrickfav/uber-apk-signer) simplifies signing multiple APKs with the same key,\
  \ and can be used to resign an app after changes have been performed to it.\n\n## References\n\n- [https://www.appknox.com/security/xamarin-reverse-engineering-a-guide-for-penetration-testers](https://www.appknox.com/security/xamarin-reverse-engineering-a-guide-for-penetration-testers)\n\
