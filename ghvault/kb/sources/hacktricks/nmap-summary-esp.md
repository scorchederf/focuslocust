  \ 192.168.0.1/24\n```\n\n## Parameters\n\n### IPs to scan\n\n- **`<ip>,<net/mask>`:** Indicate the ips directly\n- **`-iL\
  \ <ips_file>`:** list_IPs\n- **`-iR <number>`**: Number of random Ips, you can exclude possible Ips with `--exclude <Ips>`\
  \ or `--excludefile <file>`.\n\n### Equipment discovery\n\nBy default Nmap launches a discovery phase consisting of: `-PA80\
  \ -PS443 -PE -PP`\n\n- **`-sL`**: It is not invasive, it lists the targets making **DNS** requests to resolve names. It\
  \ is useful to know if for example www.prueba.es/24 all Ips are our targets.\n- **`-Pn`**: **No ping**. This is useful if\
  \ you know that all of them are active (if not, you could lose a lot of time, but this option also produces false negatives\
  \ saying that they are not active), it prevents the discovery phase.\n- **`-sn`** : **No port scan**. After completing the\
  \ reconnaissance phase, it does not scan ports. It is relatively stealthy, and allows a small network scan. With privileges\
  \ it sends an ACK (-PA) to 80, a SYN(-PS) to 443 and an echo request and a Timestamp request, without privileges it always\
  \ completes connections. If the target is the network, it only uses ARP(-PR). If used with another option, only the packets\
  \ of the other option are dropped.\n- **`-PR`**: **Ping ARP**. It is used by default when analyzing computers in our network,\
  \ it is faster than using pings. If you do not want to use ARP packets use `--send-ip`.\n- **`-PS <ports>`**: It sends SYN\
  \ packets to which if it answers SYN/ACK it is open (to which it answers with RST so as not to end the connection), if it\
  \ answers RST it is closed and if it does not answer it is unreachable. In case of not having privileges, a total connection\
  \ is automatically used. If no ports are given, it throws it to 80.\n- **`-PA <ports>`**: Like the previous one but with\
  \ ACK, combining both of them gives better results.\n- **`-PU <ports>`**: The objective is the opposite, they are sent to\
  \ ports that are expected to be closed. Some firewalls only check TCP connections. If it is closed it is answered with port\
  \ unreachable, if it is answered with another icmp or not answered it is left as destination unreachable.\n- **`-PE, -PP,\
  \ -PM`** : ICMP PINGS: echo replay, timestamp and addresmask. They are launched to find out if the target is active.\n-\
  \ **`-PY<ports>`**: Sends SCTP INIT probes to 80 by default, INIT-ACK(open) or ABORT(closed) or nothing or ICMP unreachable(inactive)\
  \ can be replied.\n- **`-PO <protocols>`**: A protocol is indicated in the headers, by default 1(ICMP), 2(IGMP) and 4(Encap\
  \ IP). For ICMP, IGMP, TCP (6) and UDP (17) protocols the protocol headers are sent, for the rest only the IP header is\
  \ sent. The purpose of this is that due to the malformation of the headers, Protocol unreachable or responses of the same\
  \ protocol are answered to know if it is up.\n- **`-n`**: No DNS\n- **`-R`**: DNS always\n- **`--system-dns`**: Force the\
  \ OS resolver instead of Nmap's parallel stub resolver. Useful when `/etc/hosts`, split-DNS, or resolver plugins return\
  \ data that Nmap's direct queries do not. It is slower, and since Nmap 7.96 forward lookups are already parallelized, this\
  \ is usually only needed for resolver compatibility.\n- **`--dns-servers <server[,server],...>`**: Force specific DNS servers\
  \ for reverse lookups. Useful in internal assessments to query authoritative or internal resolvers directly, or to bounce\
  \ `-sL`/reverse-DNS traffic away from the tester's default resolvers.\n\n### Port scanning techniques\n\n- **`-sS`**: Does\
  \ not complete the connection so it leaves no trace, very good if it can be used.(privileges) It is the one used by default.\n\
  - **`-sT`**: Completes the connection, so it does leave a trace, but it can be used for sure. By default without privileges.\n\
  - **`-sU`**: Slower, for UDP. Mostly: DNS(53), SNMP(161,162), DHCP(67 and 68), (-sU53,161,162,67,68): open(reply), closed(port\
  \ unreachable), filtered (another ICMP), open/filtered (nothing). In case of open/filtered, -sV sends numerous requests\
  \ to detect any of the versions that nmap supports and can detect the true state. It increases a lot the time.\n- **`-sY`**:\
  \ SCTP protocol fails to establish the connection, so there are no logs, works like -PY\n- **`-sN,-sX,-sF`:** Null, Fin,\
  \ Xmas, they can penetrate some firewalls and extract information. They are based on the fact that standard compliant machines\
  \ should respond with RST all requests that do not have SYN, RST or ACK lags raised: open/filtered(nothing), closed(RST),\
  \ filtered (ICMP unreachable). Unreliable on WIndows, CIsco, BSDI and OS/400. On unix yes.\n- **`-sM`**: Maimon scan: Sends\
  \ FIN and ACK flags, used for BSD, currently will return all as closed.\n- **`-sA, sW`**: ACK and Window, is used to detect\
  \ firewalls, to know if the ports are filtered or not. The -sW does distinguish between open/closed since the open ones\
  \ respond with a different window value: open (RST with window other than 0), closed (RST window = 0), filtered (ICMP unreachable\
  \ or nothing). Not all computers work this way, so if it is all closed, it is not working, if it is a few open, it is working\
  \ fine, and if it is many open and few closed, it is working the other way around.\n- **`-sI`:** Idle scan. For the cases\
  \ in which there is an active firewall but we know that it does not filter to a certain Ip (or when we simply want anonymity)\
  \ we can use the zombie scanner (it works for all the ports), to look for possible zombies we can use the scrpit ipidseq\
  \ or the exploit auxiliary/scanner/ip/ipidseq. This scanner is based on the IPID number of the IP packets.\n- **`--badsum`:**\
  \ It sends the sum wrong, the computers would discard the packets, but the firewalls could answer something, it is used\
  \ to detect firewalls.\n- **`-sZ`:** \"Weird\" SCTP scanner, when sending probes with cookie echo fragments they should\
  \ be dropped if open or responded with ABORT if closed. It can pass through firewalls that init does not pass through, the\
  \ bad thing is that it does not distinguish between filtered and open.\n- **`-sO`:** Protocol Ip scan. Sends bad and empty\
  \ headers in which sometimes not even the protocol can be distinguished. If ICMP unreachable protocol arrives it is closed,\
  \ if unreachable port arrives it is open, if another error arrives, filtered, if nothing arrives, open|filtered.\n- **`-b\
  \ <server>`:** FTPhost--> It is used to scan a host from another one, this is done by connecting the ftp of another machine\
  \ and asking it to send files to the ports that you want to scan from another machine, according to the answers we will\
  \ know if they are open or not. [\\<user>:\\<password>@]\\<server>\\[:\\<port>] Almost all ftps servers no longer let you\
  \ do this and therefore it is of little practical use.\n\n### **Focus Analysis**\n\n**-p:** Used to specify ports to scan.\
  \ To select all 65,335 ports: **-p-** or **-p all**. Nmap has an internal classification based on popularity. By default,\
  \ it uses the top 1000 ports. With **-F** (fast scan) it analyzes the top 100. With **--top-ports <number>** it analyzes\
  \ that number of top ports (from 1 to 65,335). It checks ports in random order; to prevent this, use **-r**. We can also\
  \ select specific ports: 20-30,80,443,1024- (the latter means to look from 1024 onwards). We can also group ports by protocols:\
  \ U:53,T:21-25,80,139,S:9. We can also choose a range within Nmap's popular ports: -p [-1024] analyzes up to port 1024 from\
  \ those included in nmap-services. **--port-ratio <ratio>** Analyzes the most common ports within a ratio between 0 and\
  \ 1\n\n**-sV** Version scanning, intensity can be regulated from 0 to 9, default is 7.\n\n**--version-intensity <number>**\
  \ We regulate the intensity, so that the lower it is, it will only launch the most probable probes, but not all. With this,\
  \ we can considerably shorten UDP scanning time\n\n**--version-light** Alias of `--version-intensity 2`. Very useful for\
  \ a first pass against large ranges or slow UDP services.\n\n**--version-all** Alias of `--version-intensity 9`. Forces\
  \ all probes and is useful when a service only answers rare probes.\n\n**--allports** Forces version detection on ports\
  \ excluded by `nmap-service-probes` (notably TCP/9100). Be careful: on some printers or raw socket listeners this can make\
  \ them print the probe data.\n\n**-O** OS detection\n\n**--osscan-limit** For proper host scanning, at least one open port\
  \ and one closed port are needed. If this condition isn't met and we've set this, it won't attempt OS prediction (saves\
  \ time)\n\n**--osscan-guess** When OS detection isn't perfect, this makes it try harder\n\n**Scripts**\n\n--script _<filename>_|_<category>_|_<directory>_|_<expression>_[,...]\n\
  \nTo use default scripts, use -sC or --script=default\n\nAvailable types are: auth, broadcast, default, discovery, dos,\
  \ exploit, external, fuzzer, intrusive, malware, safe, version, and vuln\n\n- **Auth:** executes all available authentication\
  \ scripts\n- **Default:** executes basic default tool scripts\n- **Discovery:** retrieves information from the target or\
  \ victim\n- **External:** script for using external resources\n- **Intrusive:** uses scripts considered intrusive to the\
  \ victim or target\n- **Malware:** checks for connections opened by malicious code or backdoors\n- **Safe:** executes non-intrusive\
  \ scripts\n- **Vuln:** discovers the most known vulnerabilities\n- **All:** executes absolutely all available NSE extension\
  \ scripts\n\nTo search for scripts:\n\n**nmap --script-help=\"http-\\*\" -> Those starting with http-**\n\n**nmap --script-help=\"\
  not intrusive\" -> All except those**\n\n**nmap --script-help=\"default or safe\" -> Those in either or both**\n\n**nmap\
  \ --script-help=\"default and safe\" --> Those in both**\n\n**nmap --script-help=\"(default or safe or intrusive) and not\
  \ http-\\*\"**\n\n--script-args _<n1>_=_<v1>_,_<n2>_={_<n3>_=_<v3>_},_<n4>_={_<v4>_,_<v5>_}\n\n--script-args-file _<filename>_\n\
  \n--script-help _<filename>_|_<category>_|_<directory>_|_<expression>_|all[,...]\n\n--script-trace ---> Provides info on\
  \ how the script is progressing\n\n--script-updatedb\n\n**To use a script, just type: nmap --script Script_Name target**\
  \ --> When using the script, both the script and scanner will execute, so scanner options can also be added. We can add\
  \ **\"safe=1\"** to execute only safe ones.\n\n**Time Control**\n\n**Nmap can modify time in seconds, minutes, ms:** --host-timeout\
  \ arguments 900000ms, 900, 900s, and 15m all do the same thing.\n\nNmap divides the total number of hosts to scan into groups\
  \ and analyzes these groups in blocks, so it doesn't move to the next block until all have been analyzed (and the user doesn't\
  \ receive any updates until the block has been analyzed). This way, it's more optimal for Nmap to use large groups. By default\
  \ in class C, it uses 256.\n\nThis can be changed with **--min-hostgroup** _**<numhosts>**_**;** **--max-hostgroup** _**<numhosts>**_\
  \ (Adjust parallel scan group sizes)\n\nYou can control the number of parallel scanners but it's better not to (Nmap already\
  \ incorporates automatic control based on network status): **--min-parallelism** _**<numprobes>**_**;** **--max-parallelism**\
  \ _**<numprobes>**_\n\nWe can modify the RTT timeout, but it's usually not necessary: **--min-rtt-timeout** _**<time>**_**,**\
  \ **--max-rtt-timeout** _**<time>**_**,** **--initial-rtt-timeout** _**<time>**_\n\nWe can modify the number of attempts:\
  \ **--max-retries** _**<numtries>**_\n\nWe can modify the scanning time of a host: **--host-timeout** _**<time>**_\n\nWe\
  \ can modify the time between each test to slow it down: **--scan-delay** _**<time>**_**;** **--max-scan-delay** _**<time>**_\n\
  \nWe can modify the number of packets per second: **--min-rate** _**<number>**_**;** **--max-rate** _**<number>**_\n\nMany\
  \ ports take a long time to respond when filtered or closed. If we're only interested in open ones, we can go faster with:\
  \ **--defeat-rst-ratelimit**\n\nTo define how aggressive we want Nmap to be: -T paranoid|sneaky|polite|normal|aggressive|insane\n\
  \n-T (0-1)\n\n-T0 --> Only scans 1 port at a time and waits 5min until the next\n\n-T1 and T2 --> Very similar but only\
  \ wait 15 and 0.4sec respectively between each test\n\n-T3 --> Default operation, includes parallel scanning\n\n-T4 -->\
  \ --max-rtt-timeout 1250ms --min-rtt-timeout 100ms --initial-rtt-timeout 500ms --max-retries 6 --max-scan-delay 10ms\n\n\
  -T5 --> --max-rtt-timeout 300ms --min-rtt-timeout 50ms --initial-rtt-timeout 250ms --max-retries 2 --host-timeout 15m --max-scan-delay\
  \ 5ms\n\n**Firewall/IDS**\n\nThey don't allow access to ports and analyze packets.\n\n**-f** To fragment packets, by default\
  \ fragments them into 8bytes after the header, to specify that size we use ..mtu (with this, don't use -f), the offset must\
  \ be multiple of 8. **Version scanners and scripts don't support fragmentation**\n\n**-D decoy1,decoy2,ME** Nmap sends scanners\
  \ but with other IP addresses as origin, this way they hide you. If you put ME in the list, Nmap will place you there, better\
  \ to put 5 or 6 before you to completely mask you. Random IPs can be generated with RND:<number> To generate <number> of\
  \ random IPs. They don't work with TCP version detectors without connection. If you're inside a network, you're interested\
  \ in using active IPs, as otherwise it will be very easy to figure out that you are the only active one.\n\nTo use random\
  \ IPs: nmap -D RND:10 Target_IP\n\n**-S IP** For when Nmap doesn't catch your IP address you have to give it with this.\
  \ Also serves to make them think another target is scanning them.\n\n**-e <interface>** To choose the interface\n\nMany\
  \ administrators leave entry ports open for everything to work correctly and it's easier for them than finding another solution.\
  \ These can be DNS ports or FTP ports... to find this vulnerability Nmap incorporates: **--source-port** _**<portnumber>**_**;-g**\
  \ _**<portnumber>**_ _They are equivalent_\n\n**--data** _**<hex string>**_ To send hexadecimal text: --data 0xdeadbeef\
  \ and --data \\xCA\\xFE\\x09\n\n**--data-string** _**<string>**_ To send normal text: --data-string \"Scan conducted by\
  \ Security Ops, extension 7192\"\n\n**--data-length** _**<number>**_ Nmap only sends headers, with this we achieve adding\
  \ a number of more bytes (which will be generated randomly)\n\nTo configure the IP packet completely use **--ip-options**\n\
  \nIf you wish to see the options in packets sent and received, specify --packet-trace. For more information and examples\
  \ of using IP options with Nmap, see [http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2006/q3/52](http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2006/q3/52).\n\
  \n**--ttl** _**<value>**_\n\n**--randomize-hosts** To make the attack less obvious\n\n**--spoof-mac** _**<MAC address, prefix,\
  \ or vendor name>**_ To change the MAC examples: Apple, 0, 01:02:03:04:05:06, deadbeefcafe, 0020F2, and Cisco\n\n**--proxies**\
  \ _**<Comma-separated list of proxy URLs>**_ To use proxies, sometimes a proxy doesn't maintain as many open connections\
  \ as Nmap wants so parallelism would need to be modified: --max-parallelism\n\n**-sP** To discover hosts in our network\
  \ by ARP\n\nMany administrators create a firewall rule that allows all packets coming from a particular port to pass through\
  \ (like 20,53 and 67), we can tell Nmap to send our packets from these ports: **nmap --source-port 53 IP**\n\n**Outputs**\n\
  \n**-oN file** Normal output\n\n**-oX file** XML output\n\n**-oS file** Script kiddies output\n\n**-oG file** Greppable\
  \ output. It still works, but it is deprecated; XML is the better format for automation because new Nmap features are added\
  \ there first. Keep using `-oN` if you want `--resume`, and prefer `-oX`/`-oA` for machine parsing.\n\n**-oA file** All\
  \ except -oS\n\n**--webxml** Changes the XML stylesheet reference to `https://nmap.org/svn/docs/nmap.xsl`, making the XML\
  \ easier to open as HTML on another machine.\n\n**--stylesheet <path|url>** Use a custom XSL stylesheet. `--webxml` is just\
  \ a shortcut to the hosted official stylesheet.\n\n**-v level** verbosity\n\n**-d level** debugging\n\n**--reason** Why\
  \ of host and state\n\n**--stats-every time** Every that time tells us how it's going\n\n**--packet-trace** To see which\
  \ packets go out, filters can be specified like: --version-trace or --script-trace\n\n**--open** shows open, open|filtered\
  \ and unfiltered\n\n**--resume file** Resumes an interrupted scan from a normal (`-oN`) or grepable (`-oG`) output file.\
  \ In current workflows it is common to keep `-oN` for resumability and `-oX` for parsing.\n\nExample for parsing/HTML conversion\
  \ workflows:\n\n```bash\n# Send only XML to stdout for tooling\nnmap -sV -oX - 10.10.10.0/24\n\n# Portable HTML-friendly\
  \ XML\nnmap -sV --webxml -oX scan.xml 10.10.10.10\n```\n\n**Miscellaneous**\n\n**-6** Allows IPv6\n\n**-A** is the same\
  \ as -O -sV -sC --traceroute\n\n**Run time**\n\nWhile Nmap is running we can change options:\n\nv / V Increase / decrease\
  \ the verbosity level\n\nd / D Increase / decrease the debugging Level\n\np / P Turn on / off packet tracing\n\n? Print\
  \ a runtime interaction help screen\n\n**Vulscan**\n\nNmap script that looks at versions of services obtained in an offline\
  \ database (downloaded from other very important ones) and returns possible vulnerabilities\n\nThe DBs it uses are:\n\n\

  \nTo download and install in the Nmap folder:\n\nwget http://www.computec.ch/projekte/vulscan/download/nmap_nse_vulscan-2.0.tar.gz\
  \ && tar -czvf nmap_nse_vulscan-2.0.tar.gz vulscan/ && sudo cp -r vulscan/ /usr/share/nmap/scripts/\n\nYou would also need\
  \ to download the DB packages and add them to /usr/share/nmap/scripts/vulscan/\n\nUsage:\n\nTo use all: sudo nmap -sV --script=vulscan\
  \ HOST_TO_SCAN\n\nTo use a specific DB: sudo nmap -sV --script=vulscan --script-args vulscandb=cve.csv HOST_TO_SCAN\n\n\
  If you have Internet access, Nmap's official `vulners` NSE script is usually the quickest maintained alternative for version-based\
  \ enrichment:\n\n```bash\nnmap -sV --script vulners --script-args mincvss=7.0 <IP>\n```\n\nThis script belongs to the `safe`,\
  \ `external`, and `vuln` categories. Because it depends on how accurate `-sV` was, validate hits manually when the service\
  \ banner is generic or proxied.\n\n## Recent Practical Notes (7.94+)\n\n- Since Nmap 7.94, UDP port scan (`-sU`) and version\
  \ detection (`-sV`) use the same `nmap-service-probes` payload source. A UDP response from the scan phase can immediately\
  \ feed version matching, so `-sU -sV --version-light` is now a good first pass against large or lossy ranges.\n- Since Nmap\
  \ 7.94, `-sV` can also probe UDP services hidden behind DTLS, which is useful for modern management/ICS gear that wraps\
  \ UDP protocols in DTLS.\n- Nmap 7.95 added a large batch of new service fingerprints, including `grpc`, `mysqlx`, `remotemouse`,\
  \ and `tuya`, plus new ICS-focused NSE coverage such as `hartip-info` and `iec61850-mms`. If you are scanning OT or embedded\
  \ estates, updating Nmap matters more than adding custom probes too early.\n- Since Nmap 7.96, forward DNS lookups are parallelized\
  \ too. Large hostname lists are much faster now, so `--system-dns` should usually be reserved for compatibility issues instead\
  \ of performance.\n\n## Speed Up Nmap Service scan x16\n\nAccording [**to this post**](https://joshua.hu/nmap-speedup-service-scanning-16x)\
  \ you can speed up the nmap service analysis by modifying all the **`totalwaitms`** values in **`/usr/share/nmap/nmap-service-probes`**\
  \ to **300** and **`tcpwrappedms`** to **200**.\n\nMoreover, probes which do not have a specifically defined **`servicewaitms`**\
  \ use a default value of **`5000`**. Therefore, we can either add values to each of the probes, or we can **compile nmap**\
  \ ourselves and change the default value in [**service_scan.h**](https://github.com/nmap/nmap/blob/master/service_scan.h#L79).\n\
  \nIf you don't want to change the values of **`totalwaitms`** and **`tcpwrappedms`** at all in the `/usr/share/nmap/nmap-service-probes`\
  \ file, you can edit the [parsing code](https://github.com/nmap/nmap/blob/master/service_scan.cc#L1358) such that these\
  \ values in the `nmap-service-probes` file are completely ignored.\n\n\n## Build a static Nmap for restricted environments\n\
  \nIn hardened or minimal Linux environments (containers, appliances), dynamically linked Nmap binaries often fail due to\
  \ missing runtime loaders or shared libraries (e.g., /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, libc.so). Building your own statically\
  \ linked Nmap and bundling NSE data allows execution without installing system packages.\n\nHigh-level approach\n- Use a\
  \ clean amd64 Ubuntu builder via Docker.\n- Build OpenSSL and PCRE2 as static libraries.\n- Build Nmap linking statically\
  \ and using the included libpcap/libdnet to avoid dynamic deps.\n- Bundle NSE scripts and data directories with the binary.\n\
  \nDiscover target architecture (example)\n```bash\nuname -a\n# If building from macOS/ARM/etc., pin the builder arch:\n\
  docker run --rm --platform=linux/amd64 -v \"$(pwd)\":/out -w /tmp ubuntu:22.04 bash -lc 'echo ok'\n```\n\nStep 1 — Prepare\
  \ toolchain\n```bash\nset -euo pipefail\nexport DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive\napt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends\
  \ \\\n  build-essential ca-certificates curl bzip2 xz-utils pkg-config perl python3 file git \\\n  automake autoconf libtool\
  \ m4 zlib1g-dev\n```\n\nStep 2 — Build static OpenSSL (1.1.1w)\n```bash\nOSSL=\"1.1.1w\"\ncurl -fsSLO \"https://www.openssl.org/source/openssl-$OSSL.tar.gz\"\
  \ntar xzf \"openssl-$OSSL.tar.gz\" && cd \"openssl-$OSSL\"\n./Configure no-shared no-zlib linux-x86_64 -static --prefix=/opt/ossl\n\
  make -j\"$(nproc)\" && make install_sw\ncd /tmp\n```\n\nStep 3 — Build static PCRE2 (10.43)\n```bash\nPCRE2=10.43\ncurl\
  \ -fsSLO \"https://github.com/PCRE2Project/pcre2/releases/download/pcre2-$PCRE2/pcre2-$PCRE2.tar.bz2\"\ntar xjf \"pcre2-$PCRE2.tar.bz2\"\
  \ && cd \"pcre2-$PCRE2\"\n./configure --disable-shared --enable-static --prefix=/opt/pcre2\nmake -j\"$(nproc)\" && make\
  \ install\ncd /tmp\n```\n\nStep 4 — Build static Nmap (7.98)\n```bash\nNMAP=7.98\ncurl -fsSLO \"https://nmap.org/dist/nmap-$NMAP.tar.bz2\"\
  \ntar xjf \"nmap-$NMAP.tar.bz2\" && cd \"nmap-$NMAP\"\nexport CPPFLAGS=\"-I/opt/ossl/include -I/opt/pcre2/include\"\nexport\
  \ LDFLAGS=\"-L/opt/ossl/lib -L/opt/pcre2/lib -static -static-libstdc++ -static-libgcc\"\nexport LIBS=\"-lpcre2-8 -ldl -lpthread\
  \ -lz\"\n./configure \\\n  --with-openssl=/opt/ossl \\\n  --with-libpcre=/opt/pcre2 \\\n  --with-libpcap=included \\\n \
  \ --with-libdnet=included \\\n  --without-zenmap --without-ndiff --without-nmap-update\n# Avoid building shared libpcap\
  \ by accident\nsed -i -e \"s/^shared: /shared: #/\" libpcap/Makefile || true\nmake -j1 V=1 nmap\nstrip nmap\n```\nKey points\n\
  - -static, -static-libstdc++, -static-libgcc force static linkage.\n- Using --with-libpcap=included/--with-libdnet=included\
  \ avoids system-shared libs.\n- sed tweak neuters a shared libpcap target if present.\n\nStep 5 — Bundle binary and NSE\
  \ data\n```bash\nmkdir -p /out/nmap-bundle/nmap-data\ncp nmap /out/nmap-bundle/nmap-linux-amd64-static\ncp -r scripts nselib\
  \ /out/nmap-bundle/nmap-data/\ncp nse_main.lua nmap-services nmap-protocols nmap-service-probes \\\n   nmap-mac-prefixes\
  \ nmap-os-db nmap-payloads nmap-rpc \\\n   /out/nmap-bundle/nmap-data/ 2>/dev/null || true\n\ntar -C /out -czf /out/nmap-linux-amd64-static-bundle.tar.gz\
  \ nmap-bundle\n```\n\nVerification and ops notes\n- Use file on the artifact to confirm it is statically linked.\n- Keep\
  \ NSE data with the binary to ensure script parity on hosts without Nmap installed.\n- Even with a static binary, execution\
  \ may be blocked by AppArmor/seccomp/SELinux; DNS/egress must still work.\n- Deterministic builds reduce supply-chain risk\
  \ vs downloading opaque “static” binaries.\n\nOne-liner (Dockerized)\n<details>\n<summary>Build, bundle, and print artifact\
