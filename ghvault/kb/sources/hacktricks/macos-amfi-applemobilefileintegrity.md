  \ and amfid\n\nIt focuses on enforcing the integrity of the code running on the system providing the logic behind XNU's\
  \ code signature verification. It's also able to check entitlements and handle other sensitive tasks such as allowing debugging\
  \ or obtaining task ports.\n\nMoreover, for some operations, the kext prefers to contact the user space running daemon `/usr/libexec/amfid`.\
  \ This trust relationship has been abused in several jailbreaks.\n\nAMFI uses **MACF** policies and it registers its hooks\
  \ the moment it's started. Also, preventing its loading or unloading it could trigger a kernel panic. However, there are\
  \ some boot arguments that allow to debilitate AMFI:\n\n- `amfi_unrestricted_task_for_pid`: Allow task_for_pid to be allowed\
  \ without required entitlements\n- `amfi_allow_any_signature`: Allow any code signature\n- `cs_enforcement_disable`: System-wide\
  \ argument used to disable code signing enforcement\n- `amfi_prevent_old_entitled_platform_binaries`: Void platform binaries\
  \ with entitlements\n- `amfi_get_out_of_my_way`: Disables amfi completely\n\nThese are some of the MACF policies it registers:\n\
  \n- **`cred_check_label_update_execve:`** Label update will be performed and return 1\n- **`cred_label_associate`**: Update\
  \ AMFI's mac label slot with label\n- **`cred_label_destroy`**: Remove AMFI’s mac label slot\n- **`cred_label_init`**: Move\
  \ 0 in AMFI's mac label slot\n- **`cred_label_update_execve`:** It checks the entitlements of the process to see it should\
  \ be allowed to modify the labels.\n- **`file_check_mmap`:** It checks if mmap is acquiring memory and setting it as executable.\
  \ In that case it check if library validation is needed and if so, it calls the library validation function.\n- **`file_check_library_validation`**:\
  \ Calls the library validation function which checks among other things if a platform binary is loading another platform\
  \ binary or if the process and the new loaded file have the same TeamID. Certain entitlements will also allow to load any\
  \ library.\n- **`policy_initbsd`**: Sets up trusted NVRAM Keys\n- **`policy_syscall`**: It checks DYLD policies like if\
  \ the binary has unrestricted segments, if it should allow env vars... this is also called when a process is started via\
  \ `amfi_check_dyld_policy_self()`.\n- **`proc_check_inherit_ipc_ports`**: It checks if when a processes executes a new binary\
  \ other processes with SEND rights over the task port of the process should keep them or not. Platform binaries are allowed,\
  \ `get-task-allow` entitled allows it, `task_for_pid-allow` entitles are allowed and binaries with the same TeamID.\n- **`proc_check_expose_task`**:\
  \ enforce entitlements\n- **`amfi_exc_action_check_exception_send`**: An exception message is sent to debugger\n- **`amfi_exc_action_label_associate\
  \ & amfi_exc_action_label_copy/populate & amfi_exc_action_label_destroy & amfi_exc_action_label_init & amfi_exc_action_label_update`**:\
  \ Label lifecycle during exception handling (debugging)\n- **`proc_check_get_task`**: Checks entitlements like `get-task-allow`\
  \ which allows other processes to get the tasks port and `task_for_pid-allow`, which allow the process to get other processes\
  \ tasks ports. If neither of those, it calls up to `amfid permitunrestricteddebugging` to check if it's allowed.\n- **`proc_check_mprotect`**:\
  \ Deny if `mprotect` is called with the flag `VM_PROT_TRUSTED` which indicates that the region must be treated as if it\
  \ has a valid code signature.\n- **`vnode_check_exec`**: Gets called when a executable files are loaded in memory and sets\
  \ `cs_hard | cs_kill` which will kill the process if any of the pages becomes invalid\n- **`vnode_check_getextattr`**: MacOS:\
  \ Check `com.apple.root.installed` and `isVnodeQuarantined()`\n- **`vnode_check_setextattr`**: As get + com.apple.private.allow-bless\
  \ and internal-installer-equivalent entitlement\n- **`vnode_check_signature`**: Code that calls XNU to check the code signature\
  \ using entitlements, trust cache and `amfid`\n- **`proc_check_run_cs_invalid`**: It intercepts `ptrace()` calls (`PT_ATTACH`\
  \ and `PT_TRACE_ME`). It checks for any of the entitlements `get-task-allow`, `run-invalid-allow` and `run-unsigned-code`\
  \ and if none, it checks if debugging is permitted.\n- **`proc_check_map_anon`**: If mmap is called with the **`MAP_JIT`**\
  \ flag, AMFI will checks for the `dynamic-codesigning` entitlement.\n\n`AMFI.kext` also exposes an API for other kernel\
  \ extensions, and it's possible to find its dependencies with:\n\n```bash\nkextstat | grep \" 19 \" | cut -c2-5,50- | cut\
  \ -d '(' -f1\nExecuting: /usr/bin/kmutil showloaded\nNo variant specified, falling back to release\n   8   com.apple.kec.corecrypto\n\
  \  19   com.apple.driver.AppleMobileFileIntegrity\n  22   com.apple.security.sandbox\n  24   com.apple.AppleSystemPolicy\n\
  \  67   com.apple.iokit.IOUSBHostFamily\n  70   com.apple.driver.AppleUSBTDM\n  71   com.apple.driver.AppleSEPKeyStore\n\
  \  74   com.apple.iokit.EndpointSecurity\n  81   com.apple.iokit.IOUserEthernet\n 101   com.apple.iokit.IO80211Family\n\
  \ 102   com.apple.driver.AppleBCMWLANCore\n 118   com.apple.driver.AppleEmbeddedUSBHost\n 134   com.apple.iokit.IOGPUFamily\n\
  \ 135   com.apple.AGXG13X\n 137   com.apple.iokit.IOMobileGraphicsFamily\n 138   com.apple.iokit.IOMobileGraphicsFamily-DCP\n\
  \ 162   com.apple.iokit.IONVMeFamily\n```\n\n## amfid\n\nThis is the user mode running daemon that `AMFI.kext` will use\
  \ to check for code signatures in user mode.\\\nFor `AMFI.kext` to communicate with the daemon it uses mach messages over\
  \ the port `HOST_AMFID_PORT` which is the special port `18`.\n\nNote that in macOS it's no longer possible for root processes\
  \ to hijack special ports as they are protected by `SIP` and only launchd can get them. In iOS it's checked that the process\
  \ sending the response back has the CDHash hardcoded of `amfid`.\n\nIt's possible to see when `amfid` is requested to check\
  \ a binary and the response of it by debugging it and setting a breakpoint in `mach_msg`.\n\nOnce a message is received\
  \ via the special port **MIG** is used to send each function to the function it's calling. The main functions were reversed\
  \ and explained inside the book.\n\n## Provisioning Profiles\n\nA provisioning profile can be used to sign code. There are\
  \ **Developer** profiles that can be used to sign code and test it, and **Enterprise** profiles which can be used in all\
  \ devices.\n\nAfter an App is submitted to the Apple Store, if approved, it's signed by Apple and the provisioning profile\
  \ is no longer needed.\n\nA profile usually use the extension `.mobileprovision` or `.provisionprofile` and can be dumped\
  \ with:\n\n```bash\nopenssl asn1parse -inform der -in /path/to/profile\n\n# Or\n\nsecurity cms -D -i /path/to/profile\n\
  ```\n\nAlthough sometimes referred as certificated, these provisioning profiles have more than a certificate:\n\n- **AppIDName:**\
  \ The Application Identifier\n- **AppleInternalProfile**: Designates this as an Apple Internal profile\n- **ApplicationIdentifierPrefix**:\
  \ Prepended to AppIDName (same as TeamIdentifier)\n- **CreationDate**: Date in `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ` format\n- **DeveloperCertificates**:\
  \ An array of (usually one) certificate(s), encoded as Base64 data\n- **Entitlements**: The entitlements allowed with entitlements\
  \ for this profile\n- **ExpirationDate**: Expiration date in `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ` format\n- **Name**: The Application\
  \ Name, the same as AppIDName\n- **ProvisionedDevices**: An array (for developer certificates) of UDIDs this profile is\
  \ valid for\n- **ProvisionsAllDevices**: A boolean (true for enterprise certificates)\n- **TeamIdentifier**: An array of\
  \ (usually one) alphanumeric string(s) used to identify the developer for inter-app interaction purposes\n- **TeamName**:\
  \ A human-readable name used to identify the developer\n- **TimeToLive**: Validity (in days) of the certificate\n- **UUID**:\
  \ A Universally Unique Identifier for this profile\n- **Version**: Currently set to 1\n\nNote that the entitlements entry\
  \ will contain a restricted set of entitlements and the provisioning profile will only be able to give those specific entitlements\
  \ to prevent giving Apple private entitlements.\n\nNote that profiles are usually located in `/var/MobileDeviceProvisioningProfiles`\
  \ and it's possible to check them with **`security cms -D -i /path/to/profile`**\n\n## **libmis.dyld**\n\nThis is the external\
  \ library that `amfid` calls i order to ask if it should allow something or not. This has been historically abused in jailbreaking\
  \ by running a backdoored version of it that would allow everything.\n\nIn macOS this is inside `MobileDevice.framework`.\n\
  \n## AMFI Trust Caches\n\niOS AMFI maintains a lost of known hashes which are signed ad-hoc, called the **Trust Cache**\
  \ and found in the kext's `__TEXT.__const` section. Note that in very specific and sensitive operations It's possible to\
  \ extend this Trust Cache with an external file.\n\n## References\n\n- [**\\*OS Internals Volume III**](https://newosxbook.com/home.html)\n\
