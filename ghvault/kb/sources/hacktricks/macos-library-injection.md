_body: "# macOS Library Injection\n\n{{#include ../../../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n> The code of\
  \ **dyld is open source** and can be found in [https://opensource.apple.com/source/dyld/](https://opensource.apple.com/source/dyld/)\
  \ and cab be downloaded a tar using a **URL such as** [https://opensource.apple.com/tarballs/dyld/dyld-852.2.tar.gz](https://opensource.apple.com/tarballs/dyld/dyld-852.2.tar.gz)\n\
  \n## **Dyld Process**\n\nTake a look on how Dyld loads libraries inside binaries in:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nmacos-dyld-process.md\n\
  {{#endref}}\n\n## **DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES**\n\nThis is like the [**LD_PRELOAD on Linux**](../../../../linux-hardening/privilege-escalation/index.html#ld_preload).\
  \ It allows to indicate a process that is going to be run to load a specific library from a path (if the env var is enabled)\n\
  \nThis technique may be also **used as an ASEP technique** as every application installed has a plist called \"Info.plist\"\
  \ that allows for the **assigning of environmental variables** using a key called `LSEnvironmental`.\n\n> [!TIP]\n> Since\
  \ 2012 **Apple has drastically reduced the power** of the **`DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES`**.\n>\n> Go to the code and **check\
  \ `src/dyld.cpp`**. In the function **`pruneEnvironmentVariables`** you can see that **`DYLD_*`** variables are removed.\n\
  >\n> In the function **`processRestricted`** the reason of the restriction is set. Checking that code you can see that the\
  \ reasons are:\n>\n> - The binary is `setuid/setgid`\n> - Existence of `__RESTRICT/__restrict` section in the macho binary.\n\
  > - The software has entitlements (hardened runtime) without [`com.apple.security.cs.allow-dyld-environment-variables`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements/com_apple_security_cs_allow-dyld-environment-variables)\
  \ entitlement\n>  - Check **entitlements** of a binary with: `codesign -dv --entitlements :- </path/to/bin>`\n>\n> In more\
  \ updated versions you can find this logic at the second part of the function **`configureProcessRestrictions`.** However,\
  \ what is executed in newer versions is the **beginning checks of the function** (you can remove the ifs related to iOS\
  \ or simulation as those won't be used in macOS.\n\n### Library Validation\n\nEven if the binary allows to use the **`DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES`**\
  \ env variable, if the binary checks the signature of the library to load it won't load a custom what.\n\nIn order to load\
  \ a custom library, the binary needs to have **one of the following entitlements**:\n\n- [`com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation`](../../macos-security-protections/macos-dangerous-entitlements.md#com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation)\n\
  - [`com.apple.private.security.clear-library-validation`](../../macos-security-protections/macos-dangerous-entitlements.md#com.apple.private.security.clear-library-validation)\n\
  \nor the binary **shouldn't** have the **hardened runtime flag** or the **library validation flag**.\n\nYou can check if\
  \ a binary has **hardened runtime** with `codesign --display --verbose <bin>` checking the flag runtime in **`CodeDirectory`**\
  \ like: **`CodeDirectory v=20500 size=767 flags=0x10000(runtime) hashes=13+7 location=embedded`**\n\nYou can also load a\
  \ library if it's **signed with the same certificate as the binary**.\n\nFind a example on how to (ab)use this and check\
  \ the restrictions in:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nmacos-dyld-hijacking-and-dyld_insert_libraries.md\n{{#endref}}\n\n## Dylib Hijacking\n\
  \n> [!CAUTION]\n> Remember that **previous Library Validation restrictions also apply** to perform Dylib hijacking attacks.\n\
  \nAs in Windows, in MacOS you can also **hijack dylibs** to make **applications** **execute** **arbitrary** **code** (well,\
  \ actually froma regular user this coul not be possible as you might need a TCC permission towrite inside an `.app` bundle\
  \ and hijack a library).\\\nHowever, the way **MacOS** applications **load** libraries is **more restricted** than in Windows.\
  \ This implies that **malware** developers can still use this technique for **stealth**, but the probably to be able to\
  \ **abuse this to escalate privileges is much lower**.\n\nFirst of all, is **more common** to find that **MacOS binaries\
  \ indicates the full path** to the libraries to load. And second, **MacOS never search** in the folders of the **$PATH**\
  \ for libraries.\n\nThe **main** part of the **code** related to this functionality is in **`ImageLoader::recursiveLoadLibraries`**\
  \ in `ImageLoader.cpp`.\n\nThere are **4 different header Commands** a macho binary can use to load libraries:\n\n- **`LC_LOAD_DYLIB`**\
  \ command is the common command to load a dylib.\n- **`LC_LOAD_WEAK_DYLIB`** command works like the previous one, but if\
  \ the dylib is not found, execution continues without any error.\n- **`LC_REEXPORT_DYLIB`** command it proxies (or re-exports)\
  \ the symbols from a different library.\n- **`LC_LOAD_UPWARD_DYLIB`** command is used when two libraries depend on each\
  \ other (this is called an _upward dependency_).\n\nHowever, there are **2 types of dylib hijacking**:\n\n- **Missing weak\
  \ linked libraries**: This means that the application will try to load a library that doesn't exist configured with **LC_LOAD_WEAK_DYLIB**.\
  \ Then, **if an attacker places a dylib where it's expected it will be loaded**.\n  - The fact that the link is \"weak\"\
  \ means that the application will continue running even if the library isn't found.\n  - The **code related** to this is\
  \ in the function `ImageLoaderMachO::doGetDependentLibraries` of `ImageLoaderMachO.cpp` where `lib->required` is only `false`\
  \ when `LC_LOAD_WEAK_DYLIB` is true.\n  - **Find weak linked libraries** in binaries with (you have later an example on\
  \ how to create hijacking libraries):\n    - ```bash\n      otool -l </path/to/bin> | grep LC_LOAD_WEAK_DYLIB -A 5 cmd LC_LOAD_WEAK_DYLIB\n\
  \      cmdsize 56\n      name /var/tmp/lib/libUtl.1.dylib (offset 24)\n      time stamp 2 Wed Jun 21 12:23:31 1969\n   \
  \   current version 1.0.0\n      compatibility version 1.0.0\n      ```\n- **Configured with @rpath**: Mach-O binaries can\
  \ have the commands **`LC_RPATH`** and **`LC_LOAD_DYLIB`**. Base on the **values** of those commands, **libraries** are\
  \ going to be **loaded** from **different directories**.\n  - **`LC_RPATH`** contains the paths of some folders used to\
  \ load libraries by the binary.\n  - **`LC_LOAD_DYLIB`** contains the path to specific libraries to load. These paths can\
  \ contain **`@rpath`**, which will be **replaced** by the values in **`LC_RPATH`**. If there are several paths in **`LC_RPATH`**\
  \ everyone will be used to search the library to load. Example:\n    - If **`LC_LOAD_DYLIB`** contains `@rpath/library.dylib`\
  \ and **`LC_RPATH`** contains `/application/app.app/Contents/Framework/v1/` and `/application/app.app/Contents/Framework/v2/`.\
  \ Both folders are going to be used to load `library.dylib`**.** If the library doesn't exist in `[...]/v1/` and attacker\
  \ could place it there to hijack the load of the library in `[...]/v2/` as the order of paths in **`LC_LOAD_DYLIB`** is\
  \ followed.\n  - **Find rpath paths and libraries** in binaries with: `otool -l </path/to/binary> | grep -E \"LC_RPATH|LC_LOAD_DYLIB\"\
  \ -A 5`\n\n> [!NOTE] > **`@executable_path`**: Is the **path** to the directory containing the **main executable file**.\n\
  >\n> **`@loader_path`**: Is the **path** to the **directory** containing the **Mach-O binary** which contains the load command.\n\
  >\n> - When used in an executable, **`@loader_path`** is effectively the **same** as **`@executable_path`**.\n> - When used\
  \ in a **dylib**, **`@loader_path`** gives the **path** to the **dylib**.\n\nThe way to **escalate privileges** abusing\
  \ this functionality would be in the rare case that an **application** being executed **by** **root** is **looking** for\
  \ some **library in some folder where the attacker has write permissions.**\n\n> [!TIP]\n> A nice **scanner** to find **missing\
  \ libraries** in applications is [**Dylib Hijack Scanner**](https://objective-see.com/products/dhs.html) or a [**CLI version**](https://github.com/pandazheng/DylibHijack).\\\
  \n> A nice **report with technical details** about this technique can be found [**here**](https://www.virusbulletin.com/virusbulletin/2015/03/dylib-hijacking-os-x).\n\
  \n**Example**\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nmacos-dyld-hijacking-and-dyld_insert_libraries.md\n{{#endref}}\n\n## Dlopen Hijacking\n\n>\
  \ [!CAUTION]\n> Remember that **previous Library Validation restrictions also apply** to perform Dlopen hijacking attacks.\n\
  \nFrom **`man dlopen`**:\n\n- When path **does not contain a slash character** (i.e. it is just a leaf name), **dlopen()\
  \ will do searching**. If **`$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH`** was set at launch, dyld will first **look in that director**y. Next,\
  \ if the calling mach-o file or the main executable specify an **`LC_RPATH`**, then dyld will **look in those** directories.\
  \ Next, if the process is **unrestricted**, dyld will search in the **current working directory**. Lastly, for old binaries,\
  \ dyld will try some fallbacks. If **`$DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH`** was set at launch, dyld will search in **those directories**,\
  \ otherwise, dyld will look in **`/usr/local/lib/`** (if the process is unrestricted), and then in **`/usr/lib/`** (this\
  \ info was taken from **`man dlopen`**).\n  1. `$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH`\n  2. `LC_RPATH`\n  3. `CWD`(if unrestricted)\n  4.\
  \ `$DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH`\n  5. `/usr/local/lib/` (if unrestricted)\n  6. `/usr/lib/`\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n> If no slashes\
  \ in the name, there would be 2 ways to do an hijacking:\n>\n> - If any **`LC_RPATH`** is **writable** (but signature is\
  \ checked, so for this you also need the binary to be unrestricted)\n> - If the binary is **unrestricted** and then it's\
  \ possible to load something from the CWD (or abusing one of the mentioned env variables)\n\n- When path **looks like a\
  \ framework** path (e.g. `/stuff/foo.framework/foo`), if **`$DYLD_FRAMEWORK_PATH`** was set at launch, dyld will first look\
  \ in that directory for the **framework partial path** (e.g. `foo.framework/foo`). Next, dyld will try the **supplied path\
  \ as-is** (using current working directory for relative paths). Lastly, for old binaries, dyld will try some fallbacks.\
  \ If **`$DYLD_FALLBACK_FRAMEWORK_PATH`** was set at launch, dyld will search those directories. Otherwise, it will search\
  \ **`/Library/Frameworks`** (on macOS if process is unrestricted), then **`/System/Library/Frameworks`**.\n  1. `$DYLD_FRAMEWORK_PATH`\n\
  \  2. supplied path (using current working directory for relative paths if unrestricted)\n  3. `$DYLD_FALLBACK_FRAMEWORK_PATH`\n\
  \  4. `/Library/Frameworks` (if unrestricted)\n  5. `/System/Library/Frameworks`\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n> If a framework path,\
  \ the way to hijack it would be:\n>\n> - If the process is **unrestricted**, abusing the **relative path from CWD** the\
  \ mentioned env variables (even if it's not said in the docs if the process is restricted DYLD\\_\\* env vars are removed)\n\
  \n- When path **contains a slash but is not a framework path** (i.e. a full path or a partial path to a dylib), dlopen()\
  \ first looks in (if set) in **`$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH`** (with leaf part from path ). Next, dyld **tries the supplied path**\
  \ (using current working directory for relative paths (but only for unrestricted processes)). Lastly, for older binaries,\
  \ dyld will try fallbacks. If **`$DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH`** was set at launch, dyld will search in those directories,\
  \ otherwise, dyld will look in **`/usr/local/lib/`** (if the process is unrestricted), and then in **`/usr/lib/`**.\n  1.\
  \ `$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH`\n  2. supplied path (using current working directory for relative paths if unrestricted)\n  3. `$DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH`\n\
  \  4. `/usr/local/lib/` (if unrestricted)\n  5. `/usr/lib/`\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n> If slashes in the name and not a framework,\
  \ the way to hijack it would be:\n>\n> - If the binary is **unrestricted** and then it's possible to load something from\
  \ the CWD or `/usr/local/lib` (or abusing one of the mentioned env variables)\n\n> [!TIP]\n> Note: There are **no** configuration\
  \ files to **control dlopen searching**.\n>\n> Note: If the main executable is a **set\\[ug]id binary or codesigned with\
  \ entitlements**, then **all environment variables are ignored**, and only a full path can be used ([check DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES\
  \ restrictions](macos-dyld-hijacking-and-dyld_insert_libraries.md#check-dyld_insert_librery-restrictions) for more detailed\
  \ info)\n>\n> Note: Apple platforms use \"universal\" files to combine 32-bit and 64-bit libraries. This means there are\
  \ **no separate 32-bit and 64-bit search paths**.\n>\n> Note: On Apple platforms most OS dylibs are **combined into the\
  \ dyld cache** and do not exist on disk. Therefore, calling **`stat()`** to preflight if an OS dylib exists **won't work**.\
  \ However, **`dlopen_preflight()`** uses the same steps as **`dlopen()`** to find a compatible mach-o file.\n\n**Check paths**\n\
  \nLets check all the options with the following code:\n\n```c\n// gcc dlopentest.c -o dlopentest -Wl,-rpath,/tmp/test\n\
  #include <dlfcn.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main(void)\n{\n    void* handle;\n\n    fprintf(\"--- No slash ---\\n\");\n\
  \    handle = dlopen(\"just_name_dlopentest.dylib\",1);\n    if (!handle) {\n        fprintf(stderr, \"Error loading: %s\\\
  n\\n\\n\", dlerror());\n    }\n\n    fprintf(\"--- Relative framework ---\\n\");\n    handle = dlopen(\"a/framework/rel_framework_dlopentest.dylib\"\
  ,1);\n    if (!handle) {\n        fprintf(stderr, \"Error loading: %s\\n\\n\\n\", dlerror());\n    }\n\n    fprintf(\"---\
  \ Abs framework ---\\n\");\n    handle = dlopen(\"/a/abs/framework/abs_framework_dlopentest.dylib\",1);\n    if (!handle)\
  \ {\n        fprintf(stderr, \"Error loading: %s\\n\\n\\n\", dlerror());\n    }\n\n    fprintf(\"--- Relative Path ---\\\
  n\");\n    handle = dlopen(\"a/folder/rel_folder_dlopentest.dylib\",1);\n    if (!handle) {\n        fprintf(stderr, \"\
  Error loading: %s\\n\\n\\n\", dlerror());\n    }\n\n    fprintf(\"--- Abs Path ---\\n\");\n    handle = dlopen(\"/a/abs/folder/abs_folder_dlopentest.dylib\"\
  ,1);\n    if (!handle) {\n        fprintf(stderr, \"Error loading: %s\\n\\n\\n\", dlerror());\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n\
  }\n```\n\nIf you compile and execute it you can see **where each library was unsuccessfully searched for**. Also, you could\
  \ **filter the FS logs**:\n\n```bash\nsudo fs_usage | grep \"dlopentest\"\n```\n\n## Relative Path Hijacking\n\nIf a **privileged\
  \ binary/app** (like a SUID or some binary with powerful entitlements) is **loading a relative path** library (for example\
  \ using `@executable_path` or `@loader_path`) and has **Library Validation disabled**, it could be possible to move the\
  \ binary to a location where the attacker could **modify the relative path loaded library**, and abuse it to inject code\
  \ on the process.\n\n## Prune `DYLD_*` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` env variables\n\nIn the file `dyld-dyld-832.7.1/src/dyld2.cpp`\
  \ it's possible to fund the function **`pruneEnvironmentVariables`**, which will remove any env variable that **starts with\
  \ `DYLD_`** and **`LD_LIBRARY_PATH=`**.\n\nIt'll also set to **null** specifically the env variables **`DYLD_FALLBACK_FRAMEWORK_PATH`**\
  \ and **`DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH`** for **suid** and **sgid** binaries.\n\nThis function is called from the **`_main`**\
  \ function of the same file if targeting OSX like this:\n\n```cpp\n#if TARGET_OS_OSX\n    if ( !gLinkContext.allowEnvVarsPrint\
  \ && !gLinkContext.allowEnvVarsPath && !gLinkContext.allowEnvVarsSharedCache ) {\n\t\tpruneEnvironmentVariables(envp, &apple);\n\
  ```\n\nand those boolean flags are set in the same file in the code:\n\n```cpp\n#if TARGET_OS_OSX\n\t// support chrooting\
  \ from old kernel\n\tbool isRestricted = false;\n\tbool libraryValidation = false;\n\t// any processes with setuid or setgid\
  \ bit set or with __RESTRICT segment is restricted\n\tif ( issetugid() || hasRestrictedSegment(mainExecutableMH) ) {\n\t\
  \tisRestricted = true;\n\t}\n\tbool usingSIP = (csr_check(CSR_ALLOW_TASK_FOR_PID) != 0);\n\tuint32_t flags;\n\tif ( csops(0,\
  \ CS_OPS_STATUS, &flags, sizeof(flags)) != -1 ) {\n\t\t// On OS X CS_RESTRICT means the program was signed with entitlements\n\
  \t\tif ( ((flags & CS_RESTRICT) == CS_RESTRICT) && usingSIP ) {\n\t\t\tisRestricted = true;\n\t\t}\n\t\t// Library Validation\
  \ loosens searching but requires everything to be code signed\n\t\tif ( flags & CS_REQUIRE_LV ) {\n\t\t\tisRestricted =\
  \ false;\n\t\t\tlibraryValidation = true;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\tgLinkContext.allowAtPaths                = !isRestricted;\n\tgLinkContext.allowEnvVarsPrint\
  \           = !isRestricted;\n\tgLinkContext.allowEnvVarsPath            = !isRestricted;\n\tgLinkContext.allowEnvVarsSharedCache\
  \     = !libraryValidation || !usingSIP;\n\tgLinkContext.allowClassicFallbackPaths   = !isRestricted;\n\tgLinkContext.allowInsertFailures\
  \         = false;\n\tgLinkContext.allowInterposing         \t = true;\n```\n\nWhich basically means that if the binary\
  \ is **suid** or **sgid**, or has a **RESTRICT** segment in the headers or it was signed with the **CS_RESTRICT** flag,\
  \ then **`!gLinkContext.allowEnvVarsPrint && !gLinkContext.allowEnvVarsPath && !gLinkContext.allowEnvVarsSharedCache`**\
  \ is true and the env variables are pruned.\n\nNote that if CS_REQUIRE_LV is true, then the variables won't be pruned but\
  \ the library validation will check they are using the same certificate as the original binary.\n\n## Check Restrictions\n\
  \n### SUID & SGID\n\n```bash\n# Make it owned by root and suid\nsudo chown root hello\nsudo chmod +s hello\n# Insert the\
  \ library\nDYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES=inject.dylib ./hello\n\n# Remove suid\nsudo chmod -s hello\n```\n\n### Section `__RESTRICT`\
  \ with segment `__restrict`\n\n```bash\ngcc -sectcreate __RESTRICT __restrict /dev/null hello.c -o hello-restrict\nDYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES=inject.dylib\
  \ ./hello-restrict\n```\n\n### Hardened runtime\n\nCreate a new certificate in the Keychain and use it to sign the binary:\n\
  \n```bash\n# Apply runtime proetction\ncodesign -s <cert-name> --option=runtime ./hello\nDYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES=inject.dylib\
  \ ./hello #Library won't be injected\n\n# Apply library validation\ncodesign -f -s <cert-name> --option=library ./hello\n\
  DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES=inject.dylib ./hello-signed #Will throw an error because signature of binary and library aren't signed\
  \ by same cert (signs must be from a valid Apple-signed developer certificate)\n\n# Sign it\n## If the signature is from\
  \ an unverified developer the injection will still work\n## If it's from a verified developer, it won't\ncodesign -f -s\
  \ <cert-name> inject.dylib\nDYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES=inject.dylib ./hello-signed\n\n# Apply CS_RESTRICT protection\ncodesign\
  \ -f -s <cert-name> --option=restrict hello-signed\nDYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES=inject.dylib ./hello-signed # Won't work\n```\n\
  \n> [!CAUTION]\n> Note that even if there are binaries signed with flags **`0x0(none)`**, they can get the **`CS_RESTRICT`**\
  \ flag dynamically when executed and therefore this technique won't work in them.\n>\n> You can check if a proc has this\
  \ flag with (get [**csops here**](https://github.com/axelexic/CSOps)):\n>\n> ```bash\n> csops -status <pid>\n> ```\n>\n\
  > and then check if the flag 0x800 is enabled.\n\n## References\n\n- [https://theevilbit.github.io/posts/dyld_insert_libraries_dylib_injection_in_macos_osx_deep_dive/](https://theevilbit.github.io/posts/dyld_insert_libraries_dylib_injection_in_macos_osx_deep_dive/)\n\
