_body: "# Network Protocols\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n## Multicast DNS (mDNS)\n\nThe **mDNS**\
  \ protocol is designed for IP address resolution within small, local networks without a dedicated name server. It operates\
  \ by multicasting a query within the subnet, prompting the host with the specified name to respond with its IP address.\
  \ All devices in the subnet can then update their mDNS caches with this information.\n\nKey points to note:\n\n- **Domain\
  \ Name Relinquishment**: A host can release its domain name by sending a packet with a TTL of zero.\n- **Usage Restriction**:\
  \ mDNS typically resolves names ending in **.local** only. Conflicts with non-mDNS hosts in this domain require network\
  \ configuration adjustments.\n- **Networking Details**:\n  - Ethernet multicast MAC addresses: IPv4 - `01:00:5E:00:00:FB`,\
  \ IPv6 - `33:33:00:00:00:FB`.\n  - IP addresses: IPv4 - `224.0.0.251`, IPv6 - `ff02::fb`.\n  - Operates over UDP port 5353.\n\
  \  - mDNS queries are confined to the local network and do not cross routers.\n\n## DNS-SD (Service Discovery)\n\nDNS-SD\
  \ is a protocol for discovering services on a network by querying specific domain names (e.g., `_printers._tcp.local`).\
  \ A response includes all related domains, such as available printers in this case. A comprehensive list of service types\
  \ can be found [here](http://www.dns-sd.org/ServiceTypes.html).\n\n## SSDP (Simple Service Discovery Protocol)\n\nSSDP facilitates\
  \ the discovery of network services and is primarily utilized by UPnP. It's a text-based protocol using UDP over port 1900,\
  \ with multicast addressing. For IPv4, the designated multicast address is `239.255.255.250`. SSDP's foundation is [HTTPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPU),\
  \ an extension of HTTP for UDP.\n\n## Web Service for Devices (WSD)\n\nDevices connected to a network can identify available\
  \ services, like printers, through the Web Service for Devices (WSD). This involves broadcasting UDP packets. Devices seeking\
  \ services send requests, while service providers announce their offerings.\n\n## OAuth 2.0\n\nOAuth 2.0 is a protocol facilitating\
  \ secure, selective sharing of user information between services. For instance, it enables services to access user data\
  \ from Google without multiple logins. The process involves user authentication, authorization by the user, and token generation\
  \ by Google, allowing service access to the specified user data.\n\n## RADIUS\n\nRADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User\
  \ Service) is a network access protocol primarily used by ISPs. It supports authentication, authorization, and accounting.\
  \ User credentials are verified by a RADIUS server, potentially including network address verification for added security.\
  \ Post-authentication, users receive network access and their session details are tracked for billing and statistical purposes.\n\
  \n## SMB and NetBIOS\n\n### SMB (Server Message Block)\n\nSMB is a protocol for sharing files, printers, and ports. It operates\
  \ directly over TCP (port 445) or via NetBIOS over TCP (ports 137, 138). This dual compatibility enhances connectivity with\
  \ various devices.\n\n### NetBIOS (Network Basic Input/Output System)\n\nNetBIOS manages network sessions and connections\
  \ for resource sharing. It supports unique names for devices and group names for multiple devices, enabling targeted or\
  \ broadcast messaging. Communication can be connectionless (no acknowledgment) or connection-oriented (session-based). While\
  \ NetBIOS traditionally operates over protocols like IPC/IPX, it's commonly used over TCP/IP. NetBEUI, an associated protocol,\
  \ is known for its speed but was also quite verbose due to broadcasting.\n\n## LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)\n\
  \nLDAP is a protocol enabling the management and access of directory information over TCP/IP. It supports various operations\
  \ for querying and modifying directory information. Predominantly, it's utilized for accessing and maintaining distributed\
  \ directory information services, allowing interaction with databases designed for LDAP communication.\n\n## Active Directory\
  \ (AD)\n\nActive Directory is a network-accessible database containing objects like users, groups, privileges, and resources,\
  \ facilitating centralized management of network entities. AD organizes its data into a hierarchical structure of domains,\
  \ which can encompass servers, groups, and users. Subdomains allow further segmentation, each potentially maintaining its\
  \ own server and user base. This structure centralizes user management, granting or restricting access to network resources.\
  \ Queries can be made to retrieve specific information, like contact details, or to locate resources, like printers, within\
  \ the domain.\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}"
