_body: "# Pointer Redirecting\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n## String pointers\n\nIf a function\
  \ call is going to use an address of a string that is located in the stack, it's possible to abuse the buffer overflow to\
  \ **overwrite this address** and put an **address to a different string** inside the binary.\n\nIf for example a **`system`**\
  \ function call is going to **use the address of a string to execute a command**, an attacker could place the **address\
  \ of a different string in the stack**, **`export PATH=.:$PATH`** and create in the current directory an **script with the\
  \ name of the first letter of the new string** as this will be executed by the binary.\n\nIn real targets, **repointing\
  \ a stack string pointer is usually more interesting than just changing the printed text**:\n\n- Redirect a later **`system`/`popen`/`execl*`**\
  \ argument to an existing `\"/bin/sh\"` or attacker-controlled command string already present in memory.\n- Redirect a later\
  \ **read** sink such as **`puts(\"%s\", ptr)`** or **`write(fd, ptr, len)`** to leak stack, heap or binary data.\n- Redirect\
  \ a later **write** sink such as **`strcpy(dst, ...)`**, **`memcpy(dst, src, len)`**, or a structure field assignment through\
  \ `ptr->field = value` to turn the stack overflow into a **second-stage arbitrary write**.\n\nWhen auditing, prioritise\
  \ stack locals such as **`char *cmd`**, **`char *path`**, **`char *buf`**, **`FILE *fp`**, or **pointers inside temporary\
  \ request/response structs** that are used **after** the overflow but **before** the function returns. This is especially\
  \ useful when the overflow cannot safely reach the saved return address because of a canary or because corrupting a nearby\
  \ pointer is enough.\n\nIf the corruption is limited to a **partial overwrite** (for example because the bug appends a `0x00`),\
  \ try to redirect the pointer to:\n\n- A nearby string in the **same stack frame**\n- Another object in the **same module\
  \ / non-PIE image**\n- A controlled region whose **high bytes stay unchanged**\n\nFor the related ASLR-oriented case where\
  \ a trailing NUL modifies an **existing stack pointer** instead of a dedicated local variable, check [Ret2ret & Reo2pop](../common-binary-protections-and-bypasses/aslr/ret2ret.md).\n\
  \nYou can find an **example** of this in:\n\n- [https://github.com/florianhofhammer/stack-buffer-overflow-internship/blob/master/ASLR%20Smack%20and%20Laugh%20reference%20-%20Tilo%20Mueller/strptr.c](https://github.com/florianhofhammer/stack-buffer-overflow-internship/blob/master/ASLR%20Smack%20and%20Laugh%20reference%20-%20Tilo%20Mueller/strptr.c)\n\

  \  - 32bit, change address to flags string in the stack so it's printed by `puts`\n\n## Function pointers\n\nSame as string\
  \ pointer but applying to functions, if the **stack contains the address of a function** that will be called, it's possible\
  \ to **change it** (e.g. to call **`system`**).\n\nUseful targets are not only explicit callback variables such as `void\
  \ (*fp)()`. In practice, look for:\n\n- **Callbacks stored in local structs** passed later to helper functions\n- **Destructor\
  \ / cleanup handlers** invoked on error paths\n- **Parser dispatch tables** or **state-machine handlers** copied to the\
  \ stack\n- **Local structs / objects** that later dispatch through an indirect call\n\nIn modern exploitation, **pointer\
  \ redirection is often the last primitive available before touching the canary**. A 2024 exploitation writeup for CVE-2024-20017\
  \ shows the typical pattern: the overflow reaches several local variables before the stack canary, the attacker corrupts\
  \ a **stack pointer plus its associated length/value**, and a later assignment through that pointer becomes an **arbitrary\
  \ write** without ever needing to return through the corrupted frame.\n\n### Pointer corruption to second-stage primitives\n\
  \nIf a nearby pointer is later dereferenced for a store, the goal is usually not to jump directly with the first overflow,\
  \ but to **upgrade the primitive**:\n\n1. Overflow a local buffer and corrupt a **pointer** plus any associated **length\
  \ / integer / index**.\n2. Wait for the function to perform a **post-overflow dereference** such as `ptr->len = x`, `memcpy(ptr,\
  \ src, n)` or `*ptr = value`.\n3. Use that resulting **write-what-where** to overwrite a GOT slot, callback, config pointer,\
  \ or another indirect callsite.\n\nThis is a good option when:\n\n- The bug stops at the canary\n- The function pointer\
  \ itself is not directly reachable\n- A 4-byte or 8-byte **data write** is easier to get than an immediate control-flow\
  \ hijack\n\nThe same idea also works for **read** primitives if the corrupted pointer is later passed to logging, printing,\
  \ or network send helpers.\n\n### Modern AArch64 note: PAC / BTI\n\nOn current AArch64 targets, a classic **saved return\
  \ address overwrite** may fail because the epilogue authenticates `x30` with PAC. In those cases, **non-return hijacks**\
  \ such as corrupted local function pointers or callback pointers become more attractive.\n\nHowever, if **BTI** is enabled,\
  \ the overwritten indirect-call target must still land on a **valid landing pad** (typically a function entry with **`bti\
  \ c`**, or in PAC-enabled code a prologue starting with **`paciasp`/`pacibsp`**). Therefore, when redirecting a stack function\
  \ pointer on AArch64, prefer:\n\n- Real function entries instead of mid-function gadgets\n- Targets whose prologue already\
  \ satisfies BTI\n- Targets where the indirect-call pointer is not additionally authenticated before use\n\nFor a related\
  \ AArch64 stack-overflow context, check [ret2win-arm64](ret2win/ret2win-arm64.md).\n\nYou can find an example in:\n\n- [https://github.com/florianhofhammer/stack-buffer-overflow-internship/blob/master/ASLR%20Smack%20and%20Laugh%20reference%20-%20Tilo%20Mueller/funcptr.c](https://github.com/florianhofhammer/stack-buffer-overflow-internship/blob/master/ASLR%20Smack%20and%20Laugh%20reference%20-%20Tilo%20Mueller/funcptr.c)\n\
