  \ Files\n\nSwap files, such as `/private/var/vm/swapfile0`, serve as **caches when the physical memory is full**. When there's\
  \ no more room in physical memory, its data is transferred to a swap file and then brought back to physical memory as needed.\
  \ Multiple swap files might be present, with names like swapfile0, swapfile1, and so on.\n\n### Hibernate Image\n\nThe file\
  \ located at `/private/var/vm/sleepimage` is crucial during **hibernation mode**. **Data from memory is stored in this file\
  \ when OS X hibernates**. Upon waking the computer, the system retrieves memory data from this file, allowing the user to\
  \ continue where they left off.\n\nIt's worth noting that on modern MacOS systems, this file is typically encrypted for\
  \ security reasons, making recovery difficult.\n\n- To check if encryption is enabled for the sleepimage, the command `sysctl\
  \ vm.swapusage` can be run. This will show if the file is encrypted.\n\n### Memory Pressure Logs\n\nAnother important memory-related\
  \ file in MacOS systems is the **memory pressure log**. These logs are located in `/var/log` and contain detailed information\
  \ about the system's memory usage and pressure events. They can be particularly useful for diagnosing memory-related issues\
  \ or understanding how the system manages memory over time.\n\n## Dumping memory with osxpmem\n\nIn order to dump the memory\
  \ in a MacOS machine you can use [**osxpmem**](https://github.com/google/rekall/releases/download/v1.5.1/osxpmem-2.1.post4.zip).\n\
  \n**Note**: This is mostly a **legacy workflow** now. `osxpmem` depends on loading a kernel extension, the [Rekall](https://github.com/google/rekall)\
  \ project is archived, the latest release is from **2017**, and the published binary targets **Intel Macs**. On current\
  \ macOS releases, especially on **Apple Silicon**, kext-based full-RAM acquisition is usually blocked by modern kernel-extension\
  \ restrictions, SIP, and platform-signing requirements. In practice, on modern systems you will more often end up doing\
  \ a **process-scoped dump** instead of a whole-RAM image.\n\n```bash\n#Dump raw format\nsudo osxpmem.app/osxpmem --format\
  \ raw -o /tmp/dump_mem\n\n#Dump aff4 format\nsudo osxpmem.app/osxpmem -o /tmp/dump_mem.aff4\n```\n\nIf you find this error:\
  \ `osxpmem.app/MacPmem.kext failed to load - (libkern/kext) authentication failure (file ownership/permissions); check the\
  \ system/kernel logs for errors or try kextutil(8)` You can fix it doing:\n\n```bash\nsudo cp -r osxpmem.app/MacPmem.kext\
  \ \"/tmp/\"\nsudo kextutil \"/tmp/MacPmem.kext\"\n#Allow the kext in \"Security & Privacy --> General\"\nsudo osxpmem.app/osxpmem\
  \ --format raw -o /tmp/dump_mem\n```\n\n**Other errors** might be fixed by **allowing the load of the kext** in \"Security\
  \ & Privacy --> General\", just **allow** it.\n\nYou can also use this **oneliner** to download the application, load the\
  \ kext and dump the memory:\n\n```bash\nsudo su\ncd /tmp; wget https://github.com/google/rekall/releases/download/v1.5.1/osxpmem-2.1.post4.zip;\
  \ unzip osxpmem-2.1.post4.zip; chown -R root:wheel osxpmem.app/MacPmem.kext; kextload osxpmem.app/MacPmem.kext; osxpmem.app/osxpmem\
  \ --format raw -o /tmp/dump_mem\n```\n\n## Live process dumping with LLDB\n\nFor **recent macOS versions**, the most practical\
  \ approach is usually to dump the memory of a **specific process** instead of trying to image all physical memory.\n\nLLDB\
  \ can save a Mach-O core file from a live target:\n\n```bash\nsudo lldb --attach-pid <pid>\n(lldb) process save-core /tmp/target.core\n\
  ```\n\nBy default this usually creates a **skinny core**. To force LLDB to include all mapped process memory:\n\n```bash\n\
  sudo lldb --attach-pid <pid>\n(lldb) process save-core /tmp/target-full.core --style full\n```\n\nUseful follow-up commands\
  \ before dumping:\n\n```bash\n# Show loaded images and main binary\n(lldb) image list\n\n# Inspect mapped regions and permissions\n\
  (lldb) memory region --all\n\n# Dump only one interesting range\n(lldb) memory read --force --outfile /tmp/region.bin --binary\
  \ <start> <end>\n```\n\nThis is usually enough when the goal is to recover:\n\n- Decrypted configuration blobs\n- In-memory\
  \ tokens, cookies, or credentials\n- Plaintext secrets that are only protected at rest\n- Decrypted Mach-O pages after unpacking\
  \ / JIT / runtime patching\n\nIf the target is protected by the **hardened runtime**, or if `taskgated` denies the attach,\
  \ you typically need one of these conditions:\n\n- The target carries **`get-task-allow`**\n- Your debugger is signed with\
  \ the proper **debugger entitlement**\n- You are **root** and the target is a non-hardened third-party process\n\nFor more\
  \ background on obtaining a task port and what can be done with it:\n\n{{#ref}}\n../macos-proces-abuse/macos-ipc-inter-process-communication/macos-thread-injection-via-task-port.md\n\
  {{#endref}}\n\n## Selective dumps with Frida or userland readers\n\nWhen a full core is too noisy, dumping only **interesting\
  \ readable ranges** is often faster. Frida is especially useful because it works well for **targeted extraction** once you\
  \ can attach to the process.\n\nExample approach:\n\n1. Enumerate readable/writable ranges\n2. Filter by module, heap, stack,\
  \ or anonymous memory\n3. Dump only the regions that contain candidate strings, keys, protobufs, plist/XML blobs, or decrypted\
  \ code/data\n\nMinimal Frida example to dump all readable anonymous ranges:\n\n```javascript\nProcess.enumerateRanges({\
  \ protection: 'rw-', coalesce: true }).forEach(function (range) {\n  try {\n    if (range.file) return;\n    var dump =\
  \ range.base.readByteArray(range.size);\n    var f = new File('/tmp/' + range.base + '.bin', 'wb');\n    f.write(dump);\n\
  \    f.close();\n  } catch (e) {}\n});\n```\n\nThis is useful when you want to avoid giant core files and only collect:\n\
  \n- App heap chunks containing secrets\n- Anonymous regions created by custom packers or loaders\n- JIT / unpacked code\
  \ pages after changing protections\n\nOlder userland tools such as [`readmem`](https://github.com/gdbinit/readmem) also\
  \ exist, but they are mainly useful as **source references** for direct `task_for_pid`/`vm_read` style dumping and are not\
  \ well-maintained for modern Apple Silicon workflows.\n\n## Quick triage notes\n\n- `sysctl vm.swapusage` is still a quick\
  \ way to check **swap usage** and whether swap is **encrypted**.\n- `sleepimage` remains relevant mainly for **hibernate/safe\
  \ sleep** scenarios, but modern systems commonly protect it, so it should be treated as an **artifact source to check**,\
  \ not as a reliable acquisition path.\n- On recent macOS releases, **process-level dumping** is generally more realistic\
  \ than **full physical memory imaging** unless you control boot policy, SIP state, and kext loading.\n\n## References\n\n\
