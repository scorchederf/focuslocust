_body: "# Dependency Confusion\n\n{{#include ../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n\n## Basic Information\n\nDependency Confusion\
  \ (a.k.a. substitution attacks) happens when a package manager resolves a dependency name from an unintended, less-trusted\
  \ registry/source (usually a public registry) instead of the intended private/internal one. This typically leads to the\
  \ installation of an attacker-controlled package.\n\nCommon root causes:\n- Typosquatting/misspelling: Importing `reqests`\
  \ instead of `requests` (resolves from public registry).\n- Non-existent/abandoned internal package: Importing `company-logging`\
  \ that no longer exists internally, so the resolver looks in public registries and finds an attacker’s package.\n- Version\
  \ preference across multiple registries: Importing an internal `company-requests` while the resolver is allowed to also\
  \ query public registries and prefers the “best”/newer version published publicly by an attacker.\n\nKey idea: If the resolver\
  \ can see multiple registries for the same package name and is allowed to pick the “best” candidate globally, you’re vulnerable\
  \ unless you constrain resolution.\n\n\n## Exploitation\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> In all cases, the attacker only needs to publish\
  \ a malicious package with the same name as the dependency your build resolves from a public registry. Installation-time\
  \ hooks (e.g., npm scripts) or import-time code paths often give code execution.\n\n### Misspelled & Inexistent\n\nIf your\
  \ project references a library that isn’t available in the private registry, and your tooling falls back to a public registry,\
  \ an attacker can seed a malicious package with that name in the public registry. Your runners/CI/dev machines will fetch\
  \ and execute it.\n\n### Unspecified Version / “Best-version” selection across indexes\n\nDevelopers frequently leave versions\
  \ unpinned or allow wide ranges. When a resolver is configured with both internal and public indexes, it may select the\
  \ newest version regardless of source. For internal names like `requests-company`, if the internal index has `1.0.1` but\
  \ an attacker publishes `1.0.2` to the public registry and your resolver considers both, the public package may win.\n\n\
  ### Related pattern: compromise of a legitimate package release\n\nDependency confusion is not the only way to get install-time\
  \ execution. If an attacker compromises the maintainer account or publishing token of a legitimate package, they can publish\
  \ a malicious version of the real package and obtain code execution on every machine that installs it.\n\nCommon pattern\
  \ in the npm ecosystem:\n- The attacker modifies only `package.json` and adds a new dependency.\n- The new dependency is\
  \ **never imported** by the main library, so source review of the application code may look clean.\n- The dependency contains\
  \ a `preinstall`/`install`/`postinstall` hook that runs automatically during `npm install`, `npm ci`, Yarn, pnpm, or CI\
  \ builds.\n- The hook fetches or drops the real payload, often choosing per-OS implants for macOS, Windows, and Linux.\n\
  \nThis is a useful red-team and incident-response mental model because **importing the victim library is not required**.\
  \ The execution path is installation-time, not runtime.\n\nMinimal malicious pattern:\n\n`package.json` of the compromised\
  \ package:\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"popular-lib\",\n  \"version\": \"1.2.4\",\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"helper-lib\"\
  : \"^4.2.1\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n`package.json` of the injected dependency:\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"helper-lib\",\n  \"version\"\
  : \"4.2.1\",\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"postinstall\": \"node setup.js\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nPractical notes:\n- CI/CD runners\
  \ are especially valuable targets because the hook runs before tests and often has access to cloud credentials, package\
  \ tokens, signing keys, and deployment secrets.\n- If you are trying to prove impact in an authorized exercise, `postinstall`\
  \ is usually enough to demonstrate install-time code execution without modifying application logic.\n- Defenders should\
  \ remember that `npm ci` still runs lifecycle scripts unless `--ignore-scripts` is set.\n\n### Obfuscated Node.js droppers\
  \ and manifest laundering\n\nMalicious install hooks often try to survive quick review by:\n- Hiding C2 strings or commands\
  \ behind layered transforms such as reversed Base64, XOR, or split strings.\n- Dynamically loading Node modules (`fs`, `os`,\
  \ `child_process`, `execSync`) only at runtime to reduce obvious static indicators.\n- Deleting the dropper after execution\
  \ and restoring a benign-looking manifest.\n\nOne anti-forensic trick is **manifest laundering**:\n1. Run the malicious\
  \ hook.\n2. Delete the malicious `setup.js` or equivalent.\n3. Delete the malicious `package.json`.\n4. Rename a benign\
  \ stub such as `package.md` back to `package.json`.\n\nAfter infection, the installed dependency directory may look clean\
  \ unless investigators review install logs, lockfile changes, registry metadata, package tarballs, file timelines, or known-good\
  \ hashes.\n\n\n## AWS Fix\n\nThis vulnerability was found in AWS CodeArtifact (read the details in this blog post). AWS\
  \ added controls to mark dependencies/feeds as internal vs external so the client won’t fetch “internal” names from upstream\
  \ public registries.\n\n\n## Finding Vulnerable Libraries\n\nIn the original post about dependency confusion the author\
  \ looked for thousands of exposed manifests (e.g., `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, lockfiles) to infer internal package\
  \ names and then published higher-versioned packages to public registries.\n\n\n## Practical Attacker Playbook (for red\
  \ teams in authorized tests)\n\n- Enumerate names:\n  - Grep repos and CI configs for manifest/lock files and internal namespaces.\n\
  \  - Look for organization-specific prefixes (e.g., `@company/*`, `company-*`, internal groupIds, NuGet ID patterns, private\
  \ module paths for Go, etc.).\n- Check public registries for availability:\n  - If the name is unregistered publicly, register\
  \ it; if it exists, attempt subdependency hijacking by targeting internal transitive names.\n- Publish with precedence:\n\
  \  - Choose a semver that “wins” (e.g., a very high version) or matches resolver rules.\n  - Include minimal install-time\
  \ execution where applicable (e.g., npm `preinstall`/`install`/`postinstall` scripts). For Python, prefer import-time execution\
  \ paths, as wheels typically don’t execute arbitrary code on install.\n- Exfil control:\n  - Ensure outbound is allowed\
  \ from CI to your controlled endpoint; otherwise use DNS queries or error messages as a side-channel to prove code execution.\n\
  \n> [!CAUTION]\n> Always get written authorization, use unique package names/versions for the engagement, and immediately\
  \ unpublish or coordinate cleanup when testing concludes.\n\n\n## Defender Playbook (what actually prevents confusion)\n\
  \nHigh-level strategies that work across ecosystems:\n- Use unique internal namespaces and bind them to a single registry.\n\
  - Avoid mixing trust levels at resolution time. Prefer a single internal registry that proxies approved public packages\
  \ instead of giving package managers both internal and public endpoints.\n- For managers that support it, map packages to\
  \ specific sources (no global “best-version” across registries).\n- Pin and lock:\n  - Use lockfiles that record the resolved\
  \ registry URLs (npm/yarn/pnpm) or use hash/attestation pinning (pip `--require-hashes`, Gradle dependency verification).\n\
  - Block public fallback for internal names at the registry/network layer.\n- Reserve your internal names in public registries\
  \ when feasible to prevent future squat.\n\n\n## Ecosystem Notes and Secure Config Snippets\n\nBelow are pragmatic, minimal\
  \ configs to reduce or eliminate dependency confusion. Prefer enforcing these in CI and developer environments.\n\n### JavaScript/TypeScript\
  \ (npm, Yarn, pnpm)\n\n- Use scoped packages for all internal code and pin the scope to your private registry.\n- Keep installs\
  \ immutable in CI (npm lockfile, `yarn install --immutable`).\n\n.npmrc (project-level)\n```\n# Bind internal scope to private\
  \ registry; do not allow public fallback for @company/*\n@company:registry=https://registry.corp.example/npm/\n# Always\
  \ authenticate to the private registry\n//registry.corp.example/npm/:_authToken=${NPM_TOKEN}\nstrict-ssl=true\n```\n\npackage.json\
  \ (for internal package)\n```\n{\n  \"name\": \"@company/api-client\",\n  \"version\": \"1.2.3\",\n  \"private\": false,\n\
  \  \"publishConfig\": {\n    \"registry\": \"https://registry.corp.example/npm/\",\n    \"access\": \"restricted\"\n  }\n\
  }\n```\n\nYarn Berry (.yarnrc.yml)\n```\nnpmScopes:\n  company:\n    npmRegistryServer: \"https://registry.corp.example/npm/\"\
  \n    npmAlwaysAuth: true\n# CI should fail if lockfile would change\nenableImmutableInstalls: true\n```\n\nOperational\
  \ tips:\n- Only publish internal packages within the `@company` scope.\n- For third-party packages, allow public registry\
  \ via your private proxy/mirror, not directly from clients.\n- Consider enabling npm package provenance for public packages\
  \ you publish to increase traceability (doesn’t by itself prevent confusion).\n- For high-risk environments, install with\
  \ scripts disabled first (`npm ci --ignore-scripts`) and only allow scripts in controlled build stages.\n\n### Python (pip\
  \ / Poetry)\n\nCore rule: Don’t use `--extra-index-url` to mix trust levels. Either:\n- Expose a single internal index that\
  \ proxies and caches approved PyPI packages, or\n- Use explicit index selection and hash pinning.\n\npip.conf\n```\n[global]\n\
  index-url = https://pypi.corp.example/simple\n# Disallow source distributions when possible\nonly-binary = :all:\n# Lock\
  \ with hashes generated via pip-tools\nrequire-hashes = true\n```\n\nGenerate hashed requirements with pip-tools:\n```\n\
  # From pyproject.toml or requirements.in\npip-compile --generate-hashes -o requirements.txt\npip install --require-hashes\
  \ -r requirements.txt\n```\n\nIf you must reach public PyPI, do it via your internal proxy and maintain an explicit allowlist\
  \ there. Avoid `--extra-index-url` in CI.\n\n### .NET (NuGet)\n\nUse Package Source Mapping to tie package ID patterns to\
  \ explicit sources and prevent resolution from unexpected feeds.\n\nnuget.config\n```\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"\
  utf-8\"?>\n<configuration>\n  <packageSources>\n    <clear />\n    <add key=\"nuget.org\" value=\"https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json\"\
  \ />\n    <add key=\"corp\" value=\"https://nuget.corp.example/v3/index.json\" />\n  </packageSources>\n  <packageSourceMapping>\n\
  \    <packageSource key=\"nuget.org\">\n      <package pattern=\"*\" />\n    </packageSource>\n    <packageSource key=\"\
  corp\">\n      <package pattern=\"Company.*\" />\n      <package pattern=\"Internal.Utilities\" />\n    </packageSource>\n\
  \  </packageSourceMapping>\n</configuration>\n```\n\n### Java (Maven/Gradle)\n\nMaven settings.xml (mirror all to internal;\
  \ disallow ad-hoc repos in POMs via Enforcer):\n```\n<settings>\n  <mirrors>\n    <mirror>\n      <id>internal-mirror</id>\n\
  \      <mirrorOf>*</mirrorOf>\n      <url>https://maven.corp.example/repository/group</url>\n    </mirror>\n  </mirrors>\n\
  </settings>\n```\n\nAdd Enforcer to ban repositories declared in POMs and force usage of your mirror:\n```\n<plugin>\n \
  \ <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>\n  <artifactId>maven-enforcer-plugin</artifactId>\n  <version>3.6.1</version>\n\
  \  <executions>\n    <execution>\n      <id>enforce-no-repositories</id>\n      <goals><goal>enforce</goal></goals>\n  \
  \    <configuration>\n        <rules>\n          <requireNoRepositories />\n        </rules>\n      </configuration>\n \
  \   </execution>\n  </executions>\n</plugin>\n```\n\nGradle: Centralize and lock dependencies.\n- Enforce repositories in\
  \ `settings.gradle(.kts)` only:\n```\ndependencyResolutionManagement {\n  repositoriesMode = RepositoriesMode.FAIL_ON_PROJECT_REPOS\n\
  \  repositories {\n    maven { url = uri(\"https://maven.corp.example/repository/group\") }\n  }\n}\n```\n- Enable dependency\
  \ verification (checksums/signatures) and commit `gradle/verification-metadata.xml`.\n\n### Go Modules\n\nConfigure private\
  \ modules so the public proxy and checksum DB aren’t used for them.\n\n```\n# Use corporate proxy first, then public proxy\
  \ as fallback\nexport GOPROXY=https://goproxy.corp.example,https://proxy.golang.org\n# Mark private paths to skip proxy\
  \ and checksum db\nexport GOPRIVATE=*.corp.example.com,github.com/your-org/*\nexport GONOSUMDB=*.corp.example.com,github.com/your-org/*\n\
  ```\n\n### Rust (Cargo)\n\nReplace crates.io with an approved internal mirror or vendor directory for builds; do not allow\
  \ arbitrary public fallback.\n\n.cargo/config.toml\n```\n[source.crates-io]\nreplace-with = \"corp-mirror\"\n\n[source.corp-mirror]\n\
  registry = \"https://crates-mirror.corp.example/index\"\n```\n\nFor publishing, be explicit with `--registry` and keep credentials\
  \ scoped to the target registry.\n\n### Ruby (Bundler)\n\nUse source blocks and disable multisource Gemfiles so gems come\
  \ only from the intended repository.\n\nGemfile\n```\nsource \"https://gems.corp.example\"\n\nsource \"https://rubygems.org\"\
  \ do\n  gem \"rails\"\n  gem \"pg\"\nend\n\nsource \"https://gems.corp.example\" do\n  gem \"company-logging\"\nend\n```\n\
  \nEnforce at config level:\n```\nbundle config set disable_multisource true\n```\n\n\n## CI/CD and Registry Controls That\
  \ Help\n\n- Private registry as a single ingress:\n  - Use Artifactory/Nexus/CodeArtifact/GitHub Packages/Azure Artifacts\
  \ as the only endpoint developers/CI can reach.\n  - Implement block/allow rules so internal namespaces never resolve from\
  \ upstream public sources.\n- Lockfiles are immutable in CI:\n  - npm: commit `package-lock.json`, use `npm ci`.\n  - Yarn:\
  \ commit `yarn.lock`, use `yarn install --immutable`.\n  - Python: commit hashed `requirements.txt`, enforce `--require-hashes`.\n\
  \  - Gradle: commit `verification-metadata.xml` and fail on unknown artifacts.\n- Outbound egress control: block direct\
  \ access from CI to public registries except via the approved proxy.\n- Name reservation: pre-register your internal names/namespaces\
  \ in public registries where supported.\n- Package provenance / attestations: when publishing public packages, enable provenance/attestations\
  \ to make tampering more detectable downstream.\n\n### Detecting unauthorized publishes in trusted-publisher pipelines\n\
  \nIf a package normally uses npm trusted publishing with GitHub Actions or GitLab OIDC, a release pushed with a stolen classic\
  \ token often looks different from legitimate releases.\n\nUseful heuristics:\n- The package version exists in the registry\
  \ but lacks the expected trusted-publisher / provenance metadata.\n- There is no matching git tag or release commit for\
  \ the published version.\n- The package tarball adds a dependency whose only purpose is a lifecycle hook.\n- The newly added\
  \ dependency is never referenced by the main library source.\n- The lockfile or install logs show `preinstall` / `postinstall`\
  \ execution shortly before network egress or secret access from a runner.\n\nThis is not limited to dependency confusion:\
  \ it also catches compromise of maintainer credentials or leaked automation tokens.\n\n### Cooldown / age-gate controls\
  \ for fresh releases\n\nFresh malicious versions are often detected and removed quickly. Delaying adoption of newly published\
  \ versions can block a large class of opportunistic supply-chain compromises:\n\n```yaml\n# pnpm-workspace.yaml\nminimumReleaseAge:\
  \ 10080 # 7 days in minutes\n```\n\n```yaml\n# .yarnrc.yml\nnpmMinimalAgeGate: \"7d\"\n```\n\n```toml\n# bunfig.toml\n[install]\n\
  minimumReleaseAge = 604800 # 7 days in seconds\n```\n\n```ini\n# .npmrc\nmin-release-age=7\n```\n\nThese controls do **not**\
  \ replace lockfiles or trusted publishing, but they reduce exposure to packages published minutes or hours earlier.\n\n\n\
