_body: "# LFI2RCE via Eternal waiting\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n## Basic Information\n\nBy default\
  \ when a file is uploaded to PHP (even if it isn't expecting it), it will generate a temporary file in `/tmp` with a name\
  \ such as **`php[a-zA-Z0-9]{6}`**, although I have seen some docker images where the generated files don't contain digits.\n\
  \nIn a local file inclusion, **if you manage to include that uploaded file, you will get RCE**.\n\nNote that by default\
  \ **PHP only allows to upload 20 files in a single request** (set in `/etc/php/<version>/apache2/php.ini`):\n\n```\n; Maximum\
  \ number of files that can be uploaded via a single request\nmax_file_uploads = 20\n```\n\nAlso, the **number of potential\
  \ filenames are 62\\*62\\*62\\*62\\*62\\*62 = 56800235584**\n\n### Other techniques\n\nOther techniques relies in attacking\
  \ PHP protocols (you won't be able if you only control the last part of the path), disclosing the path of the file, abusing\
  \ expected files, or **making PHP suffer a segmentation fault so uploaded temporary files aren't deleted**.\\\nThis technique\
  \ is **very similar to the last one but without needed to find a zero day**.\n\n### Eternal wait technique\n\nIn this technique\
  \ **we only need to control a relative path**. If we manage to upload files and make the **LFI never end**, we will have\
  \ \"enough time\" to **brute-force uploaded files** and **find** any of the ones uploaded.\n\n**Pros of this technique**:\n\
  \n- You just need to control a relative path inside an include\n- Doesn't require nginx or unexpected level of access to\
  \ log files\n- Doesn't require a 0 day to cause a segmentation fault\n- Doesn't require a path disclosure\n\nThe **main\
  \ problems** of this technique are:\n\n- Need a specific file(s) to be present (there might be more)\n- The **insane** amount\
  \ of potential file names: **56800235584**\n  - If the server **isn't using digits** the total potential amount is: **19770609664**\n\
  - By default **only 20 files** can be uploaded in a **single request**.\n- The **max number of parallel workers** of the\
  \ used server.\n  - This limit with the previous ones can make this attack last too much\n- **Timeout for a PHP request**.\
  \ Ideally this should be eternal or should kill the PHP process without deleting the temp uploaded files, if not, this will\
  \ also be a pain\n\nSo, how can you **make a PHP include never end**? Just by including the file **`/sys/kernel/security/apparmor/revision`**\
  \ (**not available in Docker containers** unfortunately...).\n\nTry it just calling:\n\n```bash\nphp -a # open php cli\n\
  include(\"/sys/kernel/security/apparmor/revision\");\n```\n\n## Apache2\n\nBy default, Apache support **150 concurrent connections**,\
  \ following [https://ubiq.co/tech-blog/increase-max-connections-apache/](https://ubiq.co/tech-blog/increase-max-connections-apache/)\
  \ it's possible to upgrade this number up to 8000. Follow this to use PHP with that module: [https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-configure-apache-http-with-mpm-event-and-php-fpm-on-ubuntu-18-04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-configure-apache-http-with-mpm-event-and-php-fpm-on-ubuntu-18-04).\n\
  \nBy default, (as I can see in my tests), a **PHP process can last eternally**.\n\nLet's do some maths:\n\n- We can use\
  \ **149 connections** to generate **149 \\* 20 = 2980 temp files** with our webshell.\n- Then, use the **last connection**\
  \ to **brute-force** potential files.\n- At a speed of **10 requests/s** the times are:\n  - 56800235584 / 2980 / 10 / 3600\
  \ \\~= **530 hours** (50% chance in 265h)\n  - (without digits) 19770609664 / 2980 / 10 / 3600 \\~= 185h (50% chance in\
  \ 93h)\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> Note that in the previous example we are **completely DoSing other clients**!\n\nIf the Apache\
  \ server is improved and we could abuse **4000 connections** (half way to the max number). We could create `3999*20 = 79980`\
  \ **files** and the **number** would be **reduced** to around **19.7h** or **6.9h** (10h, 3.5h 50% chance).\n\n## PHP-FMP\n\
  \nIf instead of using the regular php mod for apache to run PHP scripts the **web page is using** **PHP-FMP** (this improves\
  \ the efficiency of the web page, so it's common to find it), there is something else that can be done to improve the technique.\n\
  \nPHP-FMP allow to **configure** the **parameter** **`request_terminate_timeout`** in **`/etc/php/<php-version>/fpm/pool.d/www.conf`**.\\\
  \nThis parameter indicates the maximum amount of seconds **when** **request to PHP must terminate** (infinite by default,\
  \ but **30s if the param is uncommented**). When a request is being processed by PHP the indicated number of seconds, it's\
  \ **killed**. This means, that if the request was uploading temporary files, because the **php processing was stopped**,\
  \ those **files aren't going to be deleted**. Therefore, if you can make a request last that time, you can **generate thousands\
  \ of temporary files** that won't be deleted, which will **speed up the process of finding them** and reduces the probability\
  \ of a DoS to the platform by consuming all connections.\n\nSo, to **avoid DoS** lets suppose that an **attacker will be\
  \ using only 100 connections** at the same time and php max processing time by **php-fmp** (`request_terminate_timeout`**)**\
  \ is **30s**. Therefore, the number of **temp files** that can be generated **by second** is `100*20/30 = 66.67`.\n\nThen,\
  \ to generate **10000 files** an attacker would need: **`10000/66.67 = 150s`** (to generate **100000 files** the time would\
  \ be **25min**).\n\nThen, the attacker could use those **100 connections** to perform a **search brute-force**.  Supposing\
  \ a speed of 300 req/s the time needed to exploit this is the following:\n\n- 56800235584 / 10000 / 300 / 3600 \\~= **5.25\
  \ hours** (50% chance in 2.63h)\n- (with 100000 files) 56800235584 / 100000 / 300 / 3600 \\~= **0.525 hours** (50% chance\
  \ in 0.263h)\n\nYes, it's possible to generate 100000 temporary files in an EC2 medium size instance:\n\n<figure><img src=\"\
  ../../images/image (240).png\" alt=\"\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> Note that in order to trigger\
  \ the timeout it would be **enough to include the vulnerable LFI page**, so it enters in an eternal include loop.\n\n##\
  \ Nginx\n\nIt looks like by default Nginx supports **512 parallel connections** at the same time (and this number can be\
  \ improved).\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}"
