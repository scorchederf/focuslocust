_body: "# Windows Artifacts\n\n{{#include ../../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n## Generic Windows Artifacts\n\n###\
  \ Windows 10 Notifications\n\nIn the path `\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Notifications` you can\
  \ find the database `appdb.dat` (before Windows anniversary) or `wpndatabase.db` (after Windows Anniversary).\n\nInside\
  \ this SQLite database, you can find the `Notification` table with all the notifications (in XML format) that may contain\
  \ interesting data.\n\n### Timeline\n\nTimeline is a Windows characteristic that provides **chronological history** of web\
  \ pages visited, edited documents, and executed applications.\n\nThe database resides in the path `\\Users\\<username>\\\
  AppData\\Local\\ConnectedDevicesPlatform\\<id>\\ActivitiesCache.db`. This database can be opened with an SQLite tool or\
  \ with the tool [**WxTCmd**](https://github.com/EricZimmerman/WxTCmd) **which generates 2 files that can be opened with\
  \ the tool** [**TimeLine Explorer**](https://ericzimmerman.github.io/#!index.md).\n\n### ADS (Alternate Data Streams)\n\n\
  Files downloaded may contain the **ADS Zone.Identifier** indicating **how** it was **downloaded** from the intranet, internet,\
  \ etc. Some software (like browsers) usually put even **more** **information** like the **URL** from where the file was\
  \ downloaded.\n\n## **File Backups**\n\n### Recycle Bin\n\nIn Vista/Win7/Win8/Win10 the **Recycle Bin** can be found in\
  \ the folder **`$Recycle.bin`** in the root of the drive (`C:\\$Recycle.bin`).\\\nWhen a file is deleted in this folder\
  \ 2 specific files are created:\n\n- `$I{id}`: File information (date of when it was deleted}\n- `$R{id}`: Content of the\
  \ file\n\n![](<../../../images/image (1029).png>)\n\nHaving these files you can use the tool [**Rifiuti**](https://github.com/abelcheung/rifiuti2)\
  \ to get the original address of the deleted files and the date it was deleted (use `rifiuti-vista.exe` for Vista – Win10).\n\
  \n```\n.\\rifiuti-vista.exe C:\\Users\\student\\Desktop\\Recycle\n```\n\n![](<../../../images/image (495) (1) (1) (1).png>)\n\
  \n### Volume Shadow Copies\n\nShadow Copy is a technology included in Microsoft Windows that can create **backup copies**\
  \ or snapshots of computer files or volumes, even when they are in use.\n\nThese backups are usually located in the `\\\
  System Volume Information` from the root of the file system and the name is composed of **UIDs** shown in the following\
  \ image:\n\n![](<../../../images/image (94).png>)\n\nMounting the forensics image with the **ArsenalImageMounter**, the\
  \ tool [**ShadowCopyView**](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/shadow_copy_view.html) can be used to inspect a shadow copy and\
  \ even **extract the files** from the shadow copy backups.\n\n![](<../../../images/image (576).png>)\n\nThe registry entry\
  \ `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\BackupRestore` contains the files and keys **to not backup**:\n\
  \n![](<../../../images/image (254).png>)\n\nThe registry `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\VSS`\
  \ also contains configuration information about the `Volume Shadow Copies`.\n\n### Office AutoSaved Files\n\nYou can find\
  \ the office autosaved files in: `C:\\Usuarios\\\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft{Excel|Word|Powerpoint}\\`\n\n## Shell Items\n\
  \nA shell item is an item that contains information about how to access another file.\n\n### Recent Documents (LNK)\n\n\
  Windows **automatically** **creates** these **shortcuts** when the user **open, uses or creates a file** in:\n\n- Win7-Win10:\
  \ `C:\\Users\\\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Recent\\`\n- Office: `C:\\Users\\\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Office\\\
  Recent\\`\n\nWhen a folder is created, a link to the folder, to the parent folder, and the grandparent folder is also created.\n\
  \nThese automatically created link files **contain information about the origin** like if it's a **file** **or** a **folder**,\
  \ **MAC** **times** of that file, **volume information** of where is the file stored and **folder of the target file**.\
  \ This information can be useful to recover those files in case they were removed.\n\nAlso, the **date created of the link**\
  \ file is the first **time** the original file was **first** **used** and the **date** **modified** of the link file is\
  \ the **last** **time** the origin file was used.\n\nTo inspect these files you can use [**LinkParser**](http://4discovery.com/our-tools/).\n\
  \nIn this tools you will find **2 sets** of timestamps:\n\n- **First Set:**\n  1. FileModifiedDate\n  2. FileAccessDate\n\
  \  3. FileCreationDate\n- **Second Set:**\n  1. LinkModifiedDate\n  2. LinkAccessDate\n  3. LinkCreationDate.\n\nThe first\
  \ set of timestamp references the **timestamps of the file itself**. The second set references the **timestamps of the linked\
  \ file**.\n\nYou can get the same information running the Windows CLI tool: [**LECmd.exe**](https://github.com/EricZimmerman/LECmd)\n\
  \n```\nLECmd.exe -d C:\\Users\\student\\Desktop\\LNKs --csv C:\\Users\\student\\Desktop\\LNKs\n```\n\nIn this case, the\
  \ information is going to be saved inside a CSV file.\n\n### Jumplists\n\nThese are the recent files that are indicated\
  \ per application. It's the list of **recent files used by an application** that you can access on each application. They\
  \ can be created **automatically or be custom**.\n\nThe **jumplists** created automatically are stored in `C:\\Users\\{username}\\\
  AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Recent\\AutomaticDestinations\\`. The jumplists are named following the format `{id}.autmaticDestinations-ms`\
  \ where the initial ID is the ID of the application.\n\nThe custom jumplists are stored in `C:\\Users\\{username}\\AppData\\\
  Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Recent\\CustomDestination\\` and they are created by the application usually because something\
  \ **important** has happened with the file (maybe marked as favorite)\n\nThe **created time** of any jumplist indicates\
  \ the **the first time the file was accessed** and the **modified time the last time**.\n\nYou can inspect the jumplists\
  \ using [**JumplistExplorer**](https://ericzimmerman.github.io/#!index.md).\n\n![](<../../../images/image (168).png>)\n\n\
  (_Note that the timestamps provided by JumplistExplorer are related to the jumplist file itself_)\n\n### Shellbags\n\n[**Follow\
  \ this link to learn what are the shellbags.**](interesting-windows-registry-keys.md#shellbags)\n\n## Use of Windows USBs\n\
  \nIt's possible to identify that a USB device was used thanks to the creation of:\n\n- Windows Recent Folder\n- Microsoft\
  \ Office Recent Folder\n- Jumplists\n\nNote that some LNK file instead of pointing to the original path, points to the WPDNSE\
  \ folder:\n\n![](<../../../images/image (218).png>)\n\nThe files in the folder WPDNSE are a copy of the original ones, then\
  \ won't survive a restart of the PC and the GUID is taken from a shellbag.\n\n### Registry Information\n\n[Check this page\
  \ to learn](interesting-windows-registry-keys.md#usb-information) which registry keys contain interesting information about\
  \ USB connected devices.\n\n### setupapi\n\nCheck the file `C:\\Windows\\inf\\setupapi.dev.log` to get the timestamps about\
  \ when the USB connection was produced (search for `Section start`).\n\n![](<../../../images/image (477) (2) (2) (2) (2)\
  \ (2) (2) (2) (3) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1)\
  \ (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (10) (14) (2).png>)\n\n### USB Detective\n\n[**USBDetective**](https://usbdetective.com)\
  \ can be used to obtain information about the USB devices that have been connected to an image.\n\n![](<../../../images/image\
  \ (452).png>)\n\n### Plug and Play Cleanup\n\nThe scheduled task known as 'Plug and Play Cleanup' is primarily designed\
  \ for the removal of outdated driver versions. Contrary to its specified purpose of retaining the latest driver package\
  \ version, online sources suggest it also targets drivers that have been inactive for 30 days. Consequently, drivers for\
  \ removable devices not connected in the past 30 days may be subject to deletion.\n\nThe task is located at the following\
  \ path: `C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Plug and Play\\Plug and Play Cleanup`.\n\nA screenshot depicting\
  \ the task's content is provided: ![](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-wqYubtuR_W8/W19bV5S9XyI/AAAAAAAANhU/OHsBDEvjqmg9ayzdNwJ4y2DKZnhCdwSMgCLcBGAs/s1600/xml.png)\n\
  \n**Key Components and Settings of the Task:**\n\n- **pnpclean.dll**: This DLL is responsible for the actual cleanup process.\n\
  - **UseUnifiedSchedulingEngine**: Set to `TRUE`, indicating the use of the generic task scheduling engine.\n- **MaintenanceSettings**:\n\
  \  - **Period ('P1M')**: Directs the Task Scheduler to initiate the cleanup task monthly during regular Automatic maintenance.\n\
  \  - **Deadline ('P2M')**: Instructs the Task Scheduler, if the task fails for two consecutive months, to execute the task\
  \ during emergency Automatic maintenance.\n\nThis configuration ensures regular maintenance and cleanup of drivers, with\
  \ provisions for reattempting the task in case of consecutive failures.\n\n**For more information check:** [**https://blog.1234n6.com/2018/07/windows-plug-and-play-cleanup.html**](https://blog.1234n6.com/2018/07/windows-plug-and-play-cleanup.html)\n\
  \n## Emails\n\nEmails contain **2 interesting parts: The headers and the content** of the email. In the **headers** you\
  \ can find information like:\n\n- **Who** sent the emails (email address, IP, mail servers that have redirected the email)\n\
  - **When** was the email sent\n\nAlso, inside the `References` and `In-Reply-To` headers you can find the ID of the messages:\n\
  \n![](<../../../images/image (593).png>)\n\n### Windows Mail App\n\nThis application saves emails in HTML or text. You can\
  \ find the emails inside subfolders inside `\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Local\\Comms\\Unistore\\data\\3\\`. The emails\
  \ are saved with the `.dat` extension.\n\nThe **metadata** of the emails and the **contacts** can be found inside the **EDB\
  \ database**: `\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Local\\Comms\\UnistoreDB\\store.vol`\n\n**Change the extension** of the file\
  \ from `.vol` to `.edb` and you can use the tool [ESEDatabaseView](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/ese_database_view.html)\
  \ to open it. Inside the `Message` table you can see the emails.\n\n### Microsoft Outlook\n\nWhen Exchange servers or Outlook\
  \ clients are used there are going to be some MAPI headers:\n\n- `Mapi-Client-Submit-Time`: Time of the system when the\
  \ email was sent\n- `Mapi-Conversation-Index`: Number of children messages of the thread and timestamp of each message of\
  \ the thread\n- `Mapi-Entry-ID`: Message identifier.\n- `Mappi-Message-Flags` and `Pr_last_Verb-Executed`: Information about\
  \ the MAPI client (message read? no read? responded? redirected? out of the office?)\n\nIn the Microsoft Outlook client,\
  \ all the sent/received messages, contacts data, and calendar data are stored in a PST file in:\n\n- `%USERPROFILE%\\Local\
  \ Settings\\Application Data\\Microsoft\\Outlook` (WinXP)\n- `%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Outlook`\n\nThe\
  \ registry path `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\WindowsNT\\CurrentVersion\\Windows Messaging Subsystem\\Profiles\\\
  Outlook` indicates the file that is being used.\n\nYou can open the PST file using the tool [**Kernel PST Viewer**](https://www.nucleustechnologies.com/es/visor-de-pst.html).\n\
  \n![](<../../../images/image (498).png>)\n\n### Microsoft Outlook OST Files\n\nAn **OST file** is generated by Microsoft\
  \ Outlook when it's configured with **IMAP** or an **Exchange** server, storing similar information to a PST file. This\
  \ file is synchronized with the server, retaining data for **the last 12 months** up to a **maximum size of 50GB**, and\
  \ is located in the same directory as the PST file. To view an OST file, the [**Kernel OST viewer**](https://www.nucleustechnologies.com/ost-viewer.html)\
  \ can be utilized.\n\n### Retrieving Attachments\n\nLost attachments might be recoverable from:\n\n- For **IE10**: `%APPDATA%\\\
  Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Temporary Internet Files\\Content.Outlook`\n- For **IE11 and above**: `%APPDATA%\\Local\\Microsoft\\\
  InetCache\\Content.Outlook`\n\n### Thunderbird MBOX Files\n\n**Thunderbird** utilizes **MBOX files** to store data, located\
  \ at `\\Users\\%USERNAME%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Thunderbird\\Profiles`.\n\n### Image Thumbnails\n\n- **Windows XP and 8-8.1**:\
  \ Accessing a folder with thumbnails generates a `thumbs.db` file storing image previews, even after deletion.\n- **Windows\
  \ 7/10**: `thumbs.db` is created when accessed over a network via UNC path.\n- **Windows Vista and newer**: Thumbnail previews\
  \ are centralized in `%userprofile%\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Explorer` with files named **thumbcache_xxx.db**.\
  \ [**Thumbsviewer**](https://thumbsviewer.github.io) and [**ThumbCache Viewer**](https://thumbcacheviewer.github.io) are\
  \ tools for viewing these files.\n\n### Windows Registry Information\n\nThe Windows Registry, storing extensive system and\
  \ user activity data, is contained within files in:\n\n- `%windir%\\System32\\Config` for various `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE` subkeys.\n\
  - `%UserProfile%{User}\\NTUSER.DAT` for `HKEY_CURRENT_USER`.\n- Windows Vista and later versions back up `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE`\
  \ registry files in `%Windir%\\System32\\Config\\RegBack\\`.\n- Additionally, program execution information is stored in\
  \ `%UserProfile%\\{User}\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\USERCLASS.DAT` from Windows Vista and Windows 2008 Server\
  \ onwards.\n\n### Tools\n\nSome tools are useful to analyze the registry files:\n\n- **Registry Editor**: It's installed\
  \ in Windows. It's a GUI to navigate through the Windows registry of the current session.\n- [**Registry Explorer**](https://ericzimmerman.github.io/#!index.md):\
  \ It allows you to load the registry file and navigate through them with a GUI. It also contains Bookmarks highlighting\
  \ keys with interesting information.\n- [**RegRipper**](https://github.com/keydet89/RegRipper3.0): Again, it has a GUI that\
  \ allows to navigate through the loaded registry and also contains plugins that highlight interesting information inside\
  \ the loaded registry.\n- [**Windows Registry Recovery**](https://www.mitec.cz/wrr.html): Another GUI application capable\
  \ of extracting the important information from the registry loaded.\n\n### Recovering Deleted Element\n\nWhen a key is deleted\
  \ it's marked as such, but until the space it's occupying is needed it won't be removed. Therefore, using tools like **Registry\
  \ Explorer** it's possible to recover these deleted keys.\n\n### Last Write Time\n\nEach Key-Value contains a **timestamp**\
  \ indicating the last time it was modified.\n\n### SAM\n\nThe file/hive **SAM** contains the **users, groups and users passwords**\
  \ hashes of the system.\n\nIn `SAM\\Domains\\Account\\Users` you can obtain the username, the RID, last login, last failed\
  \ logon, login counter, password policy and when the account was created. To get the **hashes** you also **need** the file/hive\
  \ **SYSTEM**.\n\n### Interesting entries in the Windows Registry\n\n\n{{#ref}}\ninteresting-windows-registry-keys.md\n{{#endref}}\n\
  \n## Programs Executed\n\n### Basic Windows Processes\n\nIn [this post](https://jonahacks.medium.com/investigating-common-windows-processes-18dee5f97c1d)\
  \ you can learn about the common Windows processes to detect suspicious behaviours.\n\n### Windows Recent APPs\n\nInside\
  \ the registry `NTUSER.DAT` in the path `Software\\Microsoft\\Current Version\\Search\\RecentApps` you can subkeys with\
  \ information about the **application executed**, **last time** it was executed, and **number of times** it was launched.\n\
  \n### BAM (Background Activity Moderator)\n\nYou can open the `SYSTEM` file with a registry editor and inside the path `SYSTEM\\\
  CurrentControlSet\\Services\\bam\\UserSettings\\{SID}` you can find the information about the **applications executed by\
  \ each user** (note the `{SID}` in the path) and at **what time** they were executed (the time is inside the Data value\
  \ of the registry).\n\n### Windows Prefetch\n\nPrefetching is a technique that allows a computer to silently **fetch the\
  \ necessary resources needed to display content** that a user **might access in the near future** so resources can be accessed\
  \ quicker.\n\nWindows prefetch consists of creating **caches of the executed programs** to be able to load them faster.\
  \ These caches as created as `.pf` files inside the path: `C:\\Windows\\Prefetch`. There is a limit of 128 files in XP/VISTA/WIN7\
  \ and 1024 files in Win8/Win10.\n\nThe file name is created as `{program_name}-{hash}.pf` (the hash is based on the path\
  \ and arguments of the executable). In W10 these files are compressed. Do note that the sole presence of the file indicates\
  \ that **the program was executed** at some point.\n\nThe file `C:\\Windows\\Prefetch\\Layout.ini` contains the **names\
  \ of the folders of the files that are prefetched**. This file contains **information about the number of the executions**,\
  \ **dates** of the execution and **files** **open** by the program.\n\nTo inspect these files you can use the tool [**PEcmd.exe**](https://github.com/EricZimmerman/PECmd):\n\
  \n```bash\n.\\PECmd.exe -d C:\\Users\\student\\Desktop\\Prefetch --html \"C:\\Users\\student\\Desktop\\out_folder\"\n```\n\
  \n![](<../../../images/image (315).png>)\n\n### Superprefetch\n\n**Superprefetch** has the same goal as prefetch, **load\
  \ programs faster** by predicting what is going to be loaded next. However, it doesn't substitute the prefetch service.\\\
  \nThis service will generate database files in `C:\\Windows\\Prefetch\\Ag*.db`.\n\nIn these databases you can find the **name**\
  \ of the **program**, **number** of **executions**, **files** **opened**, **volume** **accessed**, **complete** **path**,\
  \ **timeframes** and **timestamps**.\n\nYou can access this information using the tool [**CrowdResponse**](https://www.crowdstrike.com/resources/community-tools/crowdresponse/).\n\
  \n### SRUM\n\n**System Resource Usage Monitor** (SRUM) **monitors** the **resources** **consumed** **by a process**. It\
  \ appeared in W8 and it stores the data in an ESE database located in `C:\\Windows\\System32\\sru\\SRUDB.dat`.\n\nIt gives\
  \ the following information:\n\n- AppID and Path\n- User that executed the process\n- Sent Bytes\n- Received Bytes\n- Network\
  \ Interface\n- Connection duration\n- Process duration\n\nThis information is updated every 60 mins.\n\nYou can obtain the\
  \ date from this file using the tool [**srum_dump**](https://github.com/MarkBaggett/srum-dump).\n\n```bash\n.\\srum_dump.exe\
  \ -i C:\\Users\\student\\Desktop\\SRUDB.dat -t SRUM_TEMPLATE.xlsx -o C:\\Users\\student\\Desktop\\srum\n```\n\n### AppCompatCache\
  \ (ShimCache)\n\nThe **AppCompatCache**, also known as **ShimCache**, forms a part of the **Application Compatibility Database**\
  \ developed by **Microsoft** to tackle application compatibility issues. This system component records various pieces of\
  \ file metadata, which include:\n\n- Full path of the file\n- Size of the file\n- Last Modified time under **$Standard_Information**\
  \ (SI)\n- Last Updated time of the ShimCache\n- Process Execution Flag\n\nSuch data is stored within the registry at specific\
  \ locations based on the version of the operating system:\n\n- For XP, the data is stored under `SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\\
  Control\\SessionManager\\Appcompatibility\\AppcompatCache` with a capacity for 96 entries.\n- For Server 2003, as well as\
  \ for Windows versions 2008, 2012, 2016, 7, 8, and 10, the storage path is `SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\SessionManager\\\
  AppcompatCache\\AppCompatCache`, accommodating 512 and 1024 entries, respectively.\n\nTo parse the stored information, the\
  \ [**AppCompatCacheParser** tool](https://github.com/EricZimmerman/AppCompatCacheParser) is recommended for use.\n\n![](<../../../images/image\
  \ (75).png>)\n\n### Amcache\n\nThe **Amcache.hve** file is essentially a registry hive that logs details about applications\
  \ that have been executed on a system. It is typically found at `C:\\Windows\\AppCompat\\Programas\\Amcache.hve`.\n\nThis\
  \ file is notable for storing records of recently executed processes, including the paths to the executable files and their\
  \ SHA1 hashes. This information is invaluable for tracking the activity of applications on a system.\n\nTo extract and analyze\
  \ the data from **Amcache.hve**, the [**AmcacheParser**](https://github.com/EricZimmerman/AmcacheParser) tool can be used.\
  \ The following command is an example of how to use AmcacheParser to parse the contents of the **Amcache.hve** file and\
  \ output the results in CSV format:\n\n```bash\nAmcacheParser.exe -f C:\\Users\\genericUser\\Desktop\\Amcache.hve --csv\
  \ C:\\Users\\genericUser\\Desktop\\outputFolder\n```\n\nAmong the generated CSV files, the `Amcache_Unassociated file entries`\
  \ is particularly noteworthy due to the rich information it provides about unassociated file entries.\n\nThe most interesting\
  \ CVS file generated is the `Amcache_Unassociated file entries`.\n\n### RecentFileCache\n\nThis artifact can only be found\
  \ in W7 in `C:\\Windows\\AppCompat\\Programs\\RecentFileCache.bcf` and it contains information about the recent execution\
  \ of some binaries.\n\nYou can use the tool [**RecentFileCacheParse**](https://github.com/EricZimmerman/RecentFileCacheParser)\
  \ to parse the file.\n\n### Scheduled tasks\n\nYou can extract them from `C:\\Windows\\Tasks` or `C:\\Windows\\System32\\\
  Tasks` and read them as XML.\n\n### Services\n\nYou can find them in the registry under `SYSTEM\\ControlSet001\\Services`.\
  \ You can see what is going to be executed and when.\n\n### **Windows Store**\n\nThe installed applications can be found\
  \ in `\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows\\AppRepository\\`\\\nThis repository has a **log** with **each application installed**\
  \ in the system inside the database **`StateRepository-Machine.srd`**.\n\nInside the Application table of this database,\
  \ it's possible to find the columns: \"Application ID\", \"PackageNumber\", and \"Display Name\". These columns have information\
  \ about pre-installed and installed applications and it can be found if some applications were uninstalled because the IDs\
  \ of installed applications should be sequential.\n\nIt's also possible to **find installed application** inside the registry\
  \ path: `Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Appx\\AppxAllUserStore\\Applications\\`\\\nAnd **uninstalled** **applications**\
  \ in: `Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Appx\\AppxAllUserStore\\Deleted\\`\n\n## Windows Events\n\nInformation\
  \ that appears inside Windows events are:\n\n- What happened\n- Timestamp (UTC + 0)\n- Users involved\n- Hosts involved\
  \ (hostname, IP)\n- Assets accessed (files, folder, printer, services)\n\nThe logs are located in `C:\\Windows\\System32\\\
  config` before Windows Vista and in `C:\\Windows\\System32\\winevt\\Logs` after Windows Vista. Before Windows Vista, the\
  \ event logs were in binary format and after it, they are in **XML format** and use the **.evtx** extension.\n\nThe location\
  \ of the event files can be found in the SYSTEM registry in **`HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\services\\EventLog\\{Application|System|Security}`**\n\
  \nThey can be visualized from the Windows Event Viewer (**`eventvwr.msc`**) or with other tools like [**Event Log Explorer**](https://eventlogxp.com)\
  \ **or** [**Evtx Explorer/EvtxECmd**](https://ericzimmerman.github.io/#!index.md)**.**\n\n## Understanding Windows Security\
  \ Event Logging\n\nAccess events are recorded in the security configuration file located at `C:\\Windows\\System32\\winevt\\\
  Security.evtx`. This file's size is adjustable, and when its capacity is reached, older events are overwritten. Recorded\
  \ events include user logins and logoffs, user actions, and changes to security settings, as well as file, folder, and shared\
  \ asset access.\n\n### Key Event IDs for User Authentication:\n\n- **EventID 4624**: Indicates a user successfully authenticated.\n\
  - **EventID 4625**: Signals an authentication failure.\n- **EventIDs 4634/4647**: Represent user logoff events.\n- **EventID\
  \ 4672**: Denotes login with administrative privileges.\n\n#### Sub-types within EventID 4634/4647:\n\n- **Interactive (2)**:\
  \ Direct user login.\n- **Network (3)**: Access to shared folders.\n- **Batch (4)**: Execution of batch processes.\n- **Service\
  \ (5)**: Service launches.\n- **Proxy (6)**: Proxy authentication.\n- **Unlock (7)**: Screen unlocked with a password.\n\
  - **Network Cleartext (8)**: Clear text password transmission, often from IIS.\n- **New Credentials (9)**: Usage of different\
  \ credentials for access.\n- **Remote Interactive (10)**: Remote desktop or terminal services login.\n- **Cache Interactive\
  \ (11)**: Login with cached credentials without domain controller contact.\n- **Cache Remote Interactive (12)**: Remote\
  \ login with cached credentials.\n- **Cached Unlock (13)**: Unlocking with cached credentials.\n\n#### Status and Sub Status\
  \ Codes for EventID 4625:\n\n- **0xC0000064**: User name does not exist - Could indicate a username enumeration attack.\n\
  - **0xC000006A**: Correct user name but wrong password - Possible password guessing or brute-force attempt.\n- **0xC0000234**:\
  \ User account locked out - May follow a brute-force attack resulting in multiple failed logins.\n- **0xC0000072**: Account\
  \ disabled - Unauthorized attempts to access disabled accounts.\n- **0xC000006F**: Logon outside allowed time - Indicates\
  \ attempts to access outside of set login hours, a possible sign of unauthorized access.\n- **0xC0000070**: Violation of\
  \ workstation restrictions - Could be an attempt to login from an unauthorized location.\n- **0xC0000193**: Account expiration\
  \ - Access attempts with expired user accounts.\n- **0xC0000071**: Expired password - Login attempts with outdated passwords.\n\
  - **0xC0000133**: Time sync issues - Large time discrepancies between client and server may be indicative of more sophisticated\
  \ attacks like pass-the-ticket.\n- **0xC0000224**: Mandatory password change required - Frequent mandatory changes might\
  \ suggest an attempt to destabilize account security.\n- **0xC0000225**: Indicates a system bug rather than a security issue.\n\
  - **0xC000015b**: Denied logon type - Access attempt with unauthorized logon type, such as a user trying to execute a service\
  \ logon.\n\n#### EventID 4616:\n\n- **Time Change**: Modification of the system time, could obscure the timeline of events.\n\
  \n#### EventID 6005 and 6006:\n\n- **System Startup and Shutdown**: EventID 6005 indicates the system starting up, while\
  \ EventID 6006 marks it shutting down.\n\n#### EventID 1102:\n\n- **Log Deletion**: Security logs being cleared, which is\
  \ often a red flag for covering up illicit activities.\n\n#### EventIDs for USB Device Tracking:\n\n- **20001 / 20003 /\
  \ 10000**: USB device first connection.\n- **10100**: USB driver update.\n- **EventID 112**: Time of USB device insertion.\n\
  \nFor practical examples on simulating these login types and credential dumping opportunities, refer to [Altered Security's\
  \ detailed guide](https://www.alteredsecurity.com/post/fantastic-windows-logon-types-and-where-to-find-credentials-in-them).\n\
  \nEvent details, including status and sub-status codes, provide further insights into event causes, particularly notable\
  \ in Event ID 4625.\n\n### Recovering Windows Events\n\nTo enhance the chances of recovering deleted Windows Events, it's\
  \ advisable to power down the suspect computer by directly unplugging it. **Bulk_extractor**, a recovery tool specifying\
  \ the `.evtx` extension, is recommended for attempting to recover such events.\n\n### Identifying Common Attacks via Windows\
  \ Events\n\nFor a comprehensive guide on utilizing Windows Event IDs in identifying common cyber attacks, visit [Red Team\
  \ Recipe](https://redteamrecipe.com/event-codes/).\n\n#### Brute Force Attacks\n\nIdentifiable by multiple EventID 4625\
  \ records, followed by an EventID 4624 if the attack succeeds.\n\n#### Time Change\n\nRecorded by EventID 4616, changes\
  \ to system time can complicate forensic analysis.\n\n#### USB Device Tracking\n\nUseful System EventIDs for USB device\
  \ tracking include 20001/20003/10000 for initial use, 10100 for driver updates, and EventID 112 from DeviceSetupManager\
  \ for insertion timestamps.\n\n#### System Power Events\n\nEventID 6005 indicates system startup, while EventID 6006 marks\
  \ shutdown.\n\n#### Log Deletion\n\nSecurity EventID 1102 signals the deletion of logs, a critical event for forensic analysis.\n\
