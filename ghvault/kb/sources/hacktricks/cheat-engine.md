_body: "# Cheat Engine\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n[**Cheat Engine**](https://www.cheatengine.org/downloads.php)\
  \ is a useful program to find where important values are saved inside the memory of a running game and change them.\\\n\
  When you download and run it, you are **presented** with a **tutorial** of how to use the tool. If you want to learn how\
  \ to use the tool it's highly recommended to complete it.\n\n## What are you searching?\n\n![](<../../images/image (762).png>)\n\
  \nThis tool is very useful to find **where some value** (usually a number) **is stored in the memory** of a program.\\\n\
  **Usually numbers** are stored in **4bytes** form, but you could also find them in **double** or **float** formats, or you\
  \ may want to look for something **different from a number**. For that reason you need to be sure you **select** what you\
  \ want to **search for**:\n\n![](<../../images/image (324).png>)\n\nAlso you can indicate **different** types of **searches**:\n\
  \n![](<../../images/image (311).png>)\n\nYou can also check the box to **stop the game while scanning the memory**:\n\n\
  ![](<../../images/image (1052).png>)\n\n### Hotkeys\n\nIn _**Edit --> Settings --> Hotkeys**_ you can set different **hotkeys**\
  \ for different purposes like **stopping** the **game** (which is quiet useful if at some point you want to scan the memory).\
  \ Other options are available:\n\n![](<../../images/image (864).png>)\n\n## Modifying the value\n\nOnce you **found** where\
  \ is the **value** you are **looking for** (more about this in the following steps) you can **modify it** double clicking\
  \ it, then double clicking its value:\n\n![](<../../images/image (563).png>)\n\nAnd finally **marking the check** to get\
  \ the modification done in the memory:\n\n![](<../../images/image (385).png>)\n\nThe **change** to the **memory** will be\
  \ immediately **applied** (note that until the game doesn't use this value again the value **won't be updated in the game**).\n\
  \n## Searching the value\n\nSo, we are going to suppose that there is an important value (like the life of your user) that\
  \ you want to improve, and you are looking for this value in the memory)\n\n### Through a known change\n\nSupposing you\
  \ are looking for the value 100, you **perform a scan** searching for that value and you find a lot of coincidences:\n\n\
  ![](<../../images/image (108).png>)\n\nThen, you do something so that **value changes**, and you **stop** the game and **perform**\
  \ a **next scan**:\n\n![](<../../images/image (684).png>)\n\nCheat Engine will search for the **values** that **went from\
  \ 100 to the new value**. Congrats, you **found** the **address** of the value you were looking for, you can now modify\
  \ it.\\\n_If you still have several values, do something to modify again that value, and perform another \"next scan\" to\
  \ filter the addresses._\n\n### Unknown Value, known change\n\nIn the scenario you **don't know the value** but you know\
  \ **how to make it change** (and even the value of the change) you can look for your number.\n\nSo, start by performing\
  \ a scan of type \"**Unknown initial value**\":\n\n![](<../../images/image (890).png>)\n\nThen, make the value change, indicate\
  \ **how** the **value** **changed** (in my case it was decreased by 1) and perform a **next scan**:\n\n![](<../../images/image\
  \ (371).png>)\n\nYou will be presented **all the values that were modified in the selected way**:\n\n![](<../../images/image\
  \ (569).png>)\n\nOnce you have found your value, you can modify it.\n\nNote that there are a **lot of possible changes**\
  \ and you can do these **steps as much as you want** to filter the results:\n\n![](<../../images/image (574).png>)\n\n###\
  \ Random Memory Address - Finding the code\n\nUntil know we learnt how to find an address storing a value, but it's highly\
  \ probably that in **different executions of the game that address is in different places of the memory**. So lets find\
  \ out how to always find that address.\n\nUsing some of the mentioned tricks, find the address where your current game is\
  \ storing the important value. Then (stopping the game if you whish) do a **right click** on the found **address** and select\
  \ \"**Find out what accesses this address**\" or \"**Find out what writes to this address**\":\n\n![](<../../images/image\
  \ (1067).png>)\n\nThe **first option** is useful to know which **parts** of the **code** are **using** this **address**\
  \ (which is useful for more things like **knowing where you can modify the code** of the game).\\\nThe **second option**\
  \ is more **specific**, and will be more helpful in this case as we are interested in knowing **from where this value is\
  \ being written**.\n\nOnce you have selected one of those options, the **debugger** will be **attached** to the program\
  \ and a new **empty window** will appear. Now, **play** the **game** and **modify** that **value** (without restarting the\
  \ game). The **window** should be **filled** with the **addresses** that are **modifying** the **value**:\n\n![](<../../images/image\
  \ (91).png>)\n\nNow that you found the address it's modifying the value you can **modify the code at your pleasure** (Cheat\
  \ Engine allows you to modify it for NOPs real quick):\n\n![](<../../images/image (1057).png>)\n\nSo, you can now modify\
  \ it so the code won't affect your number, or will always affect in a positive way.\n\n### Random Memory Address - Finding\
  \ the pointer\n\nFollowing the previous steps, find where the value you are interested is. Then, using \"**Find out what\
  \ writes to this address**\" find out which address writes this value and double click on it to get the disassembly view:\n\
  \n![](<../../images/image (1039).png>)\n\nThen, perform a new scan **searching for the hex value between \"\\[]\"** (the\
  \ value of $edx in this case):\n\n![](<../../images/image (994).png>)\n\n(_If several appear you usually need the smallest\
  \ address one_)\\\nNow, we have f**ound the pointer that will be modifying the value we are interested in**.\n\nClick on\
  \ \"**Add Address Manually**\":\n\n![](<../../images/image (990).png>)\n\nNow, click on the \"Pointer\" check box and add\
  \ the found address in the text box (in this scenario, the found address in the previous image was \"Tutorial-i386.exe\"\
  +2426B0):\n\n![](<../../images/image (392).png>)\n\n(Note how the first \"Address\" is automatically populated from the\
  \ pointer address you introduce)\n\nClick OK and a new pointer will be created:\n\n![](<../../images/image (308).png>)\n\
  \nNow, every time you modifies that value you are **modifying the important value even if the memory address where the value\
  \ is is different.**\n\n### Code Injection\n\nCode injection is a technique where you inject a piece of code into the target\
  \ process, and then reroute the execution of code to go through your own written code (like giving you points instead of\
  \ resting them).\n\nSo, imagine you have found the address that is subtracting 1 to the life of your player:\n\n![](<../../images/image\
  \ (203).png>)\n\nClick on Show disassembler to get the **disassemble code**.\\\nThen, click **CTRL+a** to invoke the Auto\
  \ assemble window and select _**Template --> Code Injection**_\n\n![](<../../images/image (902).png>)\n\nFill the **address\
  \ of the instruction you want to modify** (this is usually autofilled):\n\n![](<../../images/image (744).png>)\n\nA template\
  \ will be generated:\n\n![](<../../images/image (944).png>)\n\nSo, insert your new assembly code in the \"**newmem**\" section\
  \ and remove the original code from the \"**originalcode**\" if you don't want it to be executed**.** In this example the\
  \ injected code will add 2 points instead of substracting 1:\n\n![](<../../images/image (521).png>)\n\n**Click on execute\
  \ and so on and your code should be injected in the program changing the behaviour of the functionality!**\n\n## Advanced\
  \ features in Cheat Engine 7.x (2023-2025)\n\nCheat Engine has continued to evolve since version 7.0 and several quality-of-life\
  \ and *offensive-reversing* features have been added that are extremely handy when analysing modern software (and not only\
  \ games!). Below is a **very condensed field guide** to the additions you will most likely use during red-team/CTF work.\n\
  \n### Pointer Scanner 2 improvements\n* `Pointers must end with specific offsets` and the new **Deviation** slider (≥7.4)\
  \ greatly reduce false positives when you rescan after an update. Use it together with multi-map comparison (`.PTR` → *Compare\
  \ results with other saved pointer map*) to obtain a **single resilient base-pointer** in just a few minutes.\n* Bulk-filter\
  \ shortcut: after the first scan press `Ctrl+A → Space` to mark everything, then `Ctrl+I` (invert) to deselect addresses\
  \ that failed the rescan.\n\n### Ultimap 3 – Intel PT tracing\n*From 7.5 the old Ultimap was re-implemented on top of **Intel\
  \ Processor-Trace (IPT)***. This means you can now record *every* branch the target takes **without single-stepping** (user-mode\
  \ only, it will not trip most anti-debug gadgets).\n\n```\nMemory View → Tools → Ultimap 3 → check «Intel PT»\nSelect number\
  \ of buffers → Start\n```\nAfter a few seconds stop the capture and **right-click → Save execution list to file**. Combine\
  \ branch addresses with a `Find out what addresses this instruction accesses` session to locate high-frequency game-logic\
  \ hotspots extremely fast. \n\n### 1-byte `jmp` / auto-patch templates\nVersion 7.5 introduced a *one-byte* JMP stub (0xEB)\
  \ that installs an SEH handler and places an INT3 at the original location. It is generated automatically when you use **Auto\
  \ Assembler → Template → Code Injection** on instructions that cannot be patched with a 5-byte relative jump. This makes\
  \ “tight” hooks possible inside packed or size-constrained routines.\n\n### Kernel-level stealth with DBVM (AMD & Intel)\n\
  *DBVM* is CE’s built-in Type-2 hypervisor. Recent builds finally added **AMD-V/SVM support** so you can run `Driver → Load\
  \ DBVM` on Ryzen/EPYC hosts. DBVM lets you:\n1. Create hardware breakpoints invisible to Ring-3/anti-debug checks.\n2. Read/write\
  \ pageable or protected kernel memory regions even when the user-mode driver is disabled.\n3. Perform VM-EXIT-less timing-attack\
  \ bypasses (e.g. query `rdtsc` from the hypervisor).\n\n**Tip:** DBVM will refuse to load when HVCI/Memory-Integrity is\
  \ enabled on Windows 11 → turn it off or boot a dedicated VM-host.\n\n### Remote / cross-platform debugging with **ceserver**\n\
  CE now ships a full rewrite of *ceserver* and can attach over TCP to **Linux, Android, macOS & iOS** targets. A popular\
  \ fork integrates *Frida* to combine dynamic instrumentation with CE’s GUI – ideal when you need to patch Unity or Unreal\
  \ games running on a phone:\n\n```\n# on the target (arm64)\n./ceserver_arm64 &\n# on the analyst workstation\nadb forward\
  \ tcp:52736 tcp:52736   # (or ssh tunnel)\nCheat Engine → \"Network\" icon → Host = localhost → Connect\n```\nFor the Frida\
  \ bridge see `bb33bb/frida-ceserver` on GitHub. \n\n### Other noteworthy goodies\n* **Patch Scanner** (MemView → Tools)\
  \ – detects unexpected code changes in executable sections; handy for malware analysis.\n* **Structure Dissector 2** – drag-an-address\
  \ → `Ctrl+D`, then *Guess fields* to auto-evaluate C-structures.\n* **.NET & Mono Dissector** – improved Unity game support;\
  \ call methods directly from the CE Lua console.\n* **Big-Endian custom types** – reversed byte order scan/edit (useful\
  \ for console emulators and network packet buffers).\n* **Autosave & tabs** for AutoAssembler/Lua windows, plus `reassemble()`\
  \ for multi-line instruction rewrite.\n\n### Installation & OPSEC notes (2024-2025)\n* The official installer is wrapped\
  \ with InnoSetup **ad-offers** (`RAV` etc.). **Always click *Decline*** *or compile from source* to avoid PUPs. AVs will\
  \ still flag `cheatengine.exe` as a *HackTool*, which is expected.\n* Modern anti-cheat drivers (EAC/Battleye, ACE-BASE.sys,\
  \ mhyprot2.sys) detect CE’s window class even when renamed. Run your reversing copy **inside a disposable VM** or after\
  \ disabling network play.\n* If you only need user-mode access choose **`Settings → Extra → Kernel mode debug = off`** to\
  \ avoid loading CE’s unsigned driver that may BSOD on Windows 11 24H2 Secure-Boot.\n\n---\n\n## **References**\n\n- [Cheat\
