_body: "# Value-Centric Web3 Red Teaming (MITRE AADAPT)\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\nThe MITRE\
  \ Adversarial Actions in Digital Asset Payment Techniques (AADAPT) matrix captures attacker behaviors that manipulate digital\
  \ value rather than just infrastructure. Treat it as a **threat-modeling backbone**: enumerate every component that can\
  \ mint, price, authorize, or route assets, map those touchpoints to AADAPT techniques, and then drive red-team scenarios\
  \ that measure whether the environment can resist irreversible economic loss.\n\n## 1. Inventory value-bearing components\n\
  Build a map of everything that can influence value state, even if it is off-chain.\n\n- **Custodial signing services** (HSM/KMS\
  \ clusters, Vault/KMaaS, signing APIs used by bots or back-office jobs). Capture key IDs, policies, automation identities,\
  \ and approval workflows.\n- **Admin & upgrade paths** for contracts (proxy admins, governance timelocks, emergency pause\
  \ keys, parameter registries). Include who/what can call them, and under which quorum or delay.\n- **On-chain protocol logic**\
  \ handling lending, AMMs, vaults, staking, bridges, or settlement rails. Document the invariants they assume (oracle prices,\
  \ collateral ratios, rebalance cadence…).\n- **Off-chain automation** that builds transactions (market-making bots, CI/CD\
  \ pipelines, cron jobs, serverless functions). These often hold API keys or service principals that can request signatures.\n\
  - **Oracles & data feeds** (aggregator composition, quorum, deviation thresholds, update cadence). Note every upstream relied\
  \ on by automated risk logic.\n- **Bridges and cross-chain routers** (lock/mint contracts, relayers, settlement jobs) tying\
  \ chains or custodial stacks together.\n\nDeliverable: a value-flow diagram showing how assets move, who authorizes movement,\
  \ and which external signals influence business logic.\n\n## 2. Map components to AADAPT behaviors\nTranslate the AADAPT\
  \ taxonomy into concrete attack candidates per component.\n\n| Component | Primary AADAPT focus |\n| --- | --- |\n| Signing/KMS\
  \ estates | Credential theft, policy bypass, signing-abuse, governance takeover |\n| Oracles/feeds | Input poisoning, aggregation\
  \ manipulation, deviation-threshold evasion |\n| On-chain protocols | Flash-loan economic manipulation, invariant breaking,\
  \ parameter reconfiguration |\n| Automation pipelines | Compromised bot/CI identities, batch replay, unauthorized deployment\
  \ |\n| Bridges/routers | Cross-chain evasion, rapid hop laundering, settlement desynchronization |\n\nThis mapping ensures\
  \ you test not just the contracts, but every identity/automation that can indirectly steer value.\n\n## 3. Prioritize by\
  \ attacker feasibility vs. business impact\n\n1. **Operational weaknesses**: exposed CI credentials, over-privileged IAM\
  \ roles, misconfigured KMS policies, automation accounts that can request arbitrary signatures, public buckets with bridge\
  \ configs, etc.\n2. **Value-specific weaknesses**: fragile oracle parameters, upgradable contracts without multi-party approvals,\
  \ flash-loan sensitive liquidity, governance actions that bypass timelocks.\n\nWork the queue like an adversary: start with\
  \ the operational footholds that could succeed today, then progress into deep protocol/economic manipulation paths.\n\n\
  ## 4. Execute in controlled, production-realistic environments\n- **Forked mainnets / isolated testnets**: replicate bytecode,\
  \ storage, and liquidity so flash-loan paths, oracle drifts, and bridge flows run end-to-end without touching real funds.\n\
  - **Blast-radius planning**: define circuit breakers, pausable modules, rollback runbooks, and test-only admin keys before\
  \ detonating a scenario.\n- **Stakeholder coordination**: notify custodians, oracle operators, bridge partners, and compliance\
  \ so their monitoring teams expect the traffic.\n- **Legal sign-off**: document scope, authorization, and stop conditions\
  \ when simulations could cross regulated rails.\n\n## 5. Telemetry aligned with AADAPT techniques\nInstrument telemetry\
  \ streams so every scenario produces actionable detection data.\n\n- **Chain-level traces**: full call graphs, gas usage,\
  \ transaction nonces, block timestamps—to reconstruct flash-loan bundles, reentrancy-like structures, and cross-contract\
  \ hops.\n- **Application/API logs**: tie each on-chain tx back to a human or automation identity (session ID, OAuth client,\
  \ API key, CI job ID) with IPs and auth methods.\n- **KMS/HSM logs**: key ID, caller principal, policy result, destination\
  \ address, and reason codes for every signature. Baseline change windows and high-risk operations.\n- **Oracle/feed metadata**:\
  \ per-update data source composition, reported value, deviation from rolling averages, thresholds triggered, and failover\
  \ paths exercised.\n- **Bridge/swap traces**: correlate lock/mint/unlock events across chains with correlation IDs, chain\
  \ IDs, relayer identity, and hop timing.\n- **Anomaly markers**: derived metrics such as slippage spikes, abnormal collateralization\
  \ ratios, unusual gas density, or cross-chain velocity.\n\nTag everything with scenario IDs or synthetic user IDs so analysts\
  \ can align observables with the AADAPT technique being exercised.\n\n## 6. Purple-team loop & maturity metrics\n1. Run\
  \ the scenario in the controlled environment and capture detections (alerts, dashboards, responders paged).\n2. Map each\
  \ step to the specific AADAPT techniques plus the observables produced in chain/app/KMS/oracle/bridge planes.\n3. Formulate\
  \ and deploy detection hypotheses (threshold rules, correlation searches, invariant checks).\n4. Re-run until mean time\
  \ to detect (MTTD) and mean time to contain (MTTC) meet business tolerances and playbooks reliably halt the value loss.\n\
  \nTrack program maturity on three axes:\n- **Visibility**: every critical value path has telemetry in each plane.\n- **Coverage**:\
  \ proportion of prioritized AADAPT techniques exercised end-to-end.\n- **Response**: ability to pause contracts, revoke\
  \ keys, or freeze flows before irreversible loss.\n\nTypical milestones: (1) completed value inventory + AADAPT mapping,\
  \ (2) first end-to-end scenario with detections implemented, (3) quarterly purple-team cycles expanding coverage and driving\
  \ down MTTD/MTTC.\n\n## 7. Scenario templates\nUse these repeatable blueprints to design simulations that map directly to\
  \ AADAPT behaviors.\n\n### Scenario A – Flash-loan economic manipulation\n- **Objective**: borrow transient capital inside\
  \ one transaction to distort AMM prices/liquidity and trigger mispriced borrows, liquidations, or mints before repaying.\n\
  - **Execution**:\n  1. Fork the target chain and seed pools with production-like liquidity.\n  2. Borrow large notional\
  \ via flash loan.\n  3. Perform calibrated swaps to cross price/threshold boundaries relied on by lending, vault, or derivative\
  \ logic.\n  4. Invoke the victim contract immediately after the distortion (borrow, liquidate, mint) and repay the flash\
  \ loan.\n- **Measurement**: Did the invariant violation succeed? Were slippage/price-deviation monitors, circuit breakers,\
  \ or governance pause hooks triggered? How long until analytics flagged the abnormal gas/call graph pattern?\n\n### Scenario\
  \ B – Oracle/data-feed poisoning\n- **Objective**: determine whether manipulated feeds can trigger destructive automated\
  \ actions (mass liquidations, incorrect settlements).\n- **Execution**:\n  1. In the fork/testnet, deploy a malicious feed\
  \ or adjust aggregator weights/quorum/update cadence beyond tolerated deviation.\n  2. Let dependent contracts consume the\
  \ poisoned values and execute their standard logic.\n- **Measurement**: Feed-level out-of-band alerts, fallback oracle activation,\
  \ min/max bound enforcement, and latency between anomaly onset and operator response.\n\n### Scenario C – Credential/signing\
  \ abuse\n- **Objective**: test whether compromising a single signer or automation identity enables unauthorized upgrades,\
  \ parameter changes, or treasury drains.\n- **Execution**:\n  1. Enumerate identities with sensitive signing rights (operators,\
  \ CI tokens, service accounts invoking KMS/HSM, multisig participants).\n  2. Simulate compromise (re-use their credentials/keys\
  \ within the lab scope).\n  3. Attempt privileged actions: upgrade proxies, change risk parameters, mint/pause assets, or\
  \ trigger governance proposals.\n- **Measurement**: Do KMS/HSM logs raise anomaly alerts (time-of-day, destination drift,\
  \ burst of high-risk operations)? Can policies or multisig thresholds prevent unilateral abuse? Are throttles/rate limits\
  \ or additional approvals enforced?\n\n### Scenario D – Cross-chain evasion & traceability gaps\n- **Objective**: evaluate\
  \ how well defenders can trace and interdict assets rapidly laundered across bridges, DEX routers, and privacy hops.\n-\
  \ **Execution**:\n  1. Chain together lock/mint operations across common bridges, interleave swaps/mixers on each hop, and\
  \ maintain per-hop correlation IDs.\n  2. Accelerate transfers to stress monitoring latency (multi-hop within minutes/blocks).\n\
  - **Measurement**: Time to correlate events across telemetry + commercial chain analytics, completeness of the reconstructed\
  \ path, ability to identify choke points for freezing in a real incident, and alert fidelity for abnormal cross-chain velocity/value.\n\
