  \ X-Forwarded-For` (Check hop-by-hop headers)\n\nRewrite **location**:\n\n- `X-Original-URL: /admin/console`\n- `X-Rewrite-URL:\
  \ /admin/console`\n\n## Hop-by-Hop headers\n\nA hop-by-hop header is a header which is designed to be processed and consumed\
  \ by the proxy currently handling the request, as opposed to an end-to-end header.\n\n- `Connection: close, X-Forwarded-For`\n\
  \n\n{{#ref}}\n../../pentesting-web/abusing-hop-by-hop-headers.md\n{{#endref}}\n\n## HTTP Request Smuggling\n\n- `Content-Length:\
  \ 30`\n- `Transfer-Encoding: chunked`\n\n\n{{#ref}}\n../../pentesting-web/http-request-smuggling/\n{{#endref}}\n\n## The\
  \ Expect header\n\nIt's posible for the client to send the header `Expect: 100-continue` and then the server could respond\
  \ with `HTTP/1.1 100 Continue` to allow the client to continue sending the body of the request. However, some proxies don't\
  \ really llike this header.\n\nInteresting results of `Expect: 100-continue`:\n- Sending a HEAD request with a body the\
  \ server didn't took into account that HEAD requests don't have body and keep the connection open until it timed out.\n\
  - Another servers sent extrange data: Random data read from the socket in the response, secret keys or even it allowed to\
  \ prevent the front-end from removing header values.\n- It also caused a `0.CL` desync cause the backend responded with\
  \ a 400 response isntead of a 100 response, but the proxy front-end was prepared to send the body of the initial request,\
  \ so it sends it and the backend takes it as new request.\n- Sending an `Expect: y 100-continue` variation also caused the\
  \ `0.CL` desync.\n- A similar error where the backend responded with a 404 generated a `CL.0` desync because the malicious\
  \ request indicates a `Content-Length` so the backend sends the malicious request + the `Content-Length` bytes of the next\
  \ request (of a victim), this desyncs the queue cause the backend sends the 404 request for the malicious request + the\
  \ repsonse of the victim requests, but the front end thought that only 1 request was sent, so the second response is sent\
  \ to a seond victim request and the the reponse of taht one is sent to the next one...\n\nFor more info about HTTP Request\

  \ Cache Headers**:\n\n- **`X-Cache`** in the response may have the value **`miss`** when the request wasn't cached and the\
  \ value **`hit`** when it is cached\n  - Similar behaviour in the header **`Cf-Cache-Status`**\n- **`Cache-Control`** indicates\
  \ if a resource is being cached and when will be the next time the resource will be cached again: `Cache-Control: public,\
  \ max-age=1800`\n- **`Vary`** is often used in the response to **indicate additional headers** that are treated as **part\
  \ of the cache key** even if they are normally unkeyed.\n- **`Age`** defines the times in seconds the object has been in\
  \ the proxy cache.\n- **`Server-Timing: cdn-cache; desc=HIT`** also indicates that a resource was cached\n\n\n{{#ref}}\n\
  ../../pentesting-web/cache-deception/\n{{#endref}}\n\n**Local Cache headers**:\n\n- `Clear-Site-Data`: Header to indicate\
  \ the cache that should be removed: `Clear-Site-Data: \"cache\", \"cookies\"`\n- `Expires`: Contains date/time when the\
  \ response should expire: `Expires: Wed, 21 Oct 2015 07:28:00 GMT`\n- `Pragma: no-cache` same as `Cache-Control: no-cache`\n\
  - `Warning`: The **`Warning`** general HTTP header contains information about possible problems with the status of the message.\
  \ More than one `Warning` header may appear in a response. `Warning: 110 anderson/1.3.37 \"Response is stale\"`\n\n## Conditionals\n\
  \n- Requests using these headers: **`If-Modified-Since`** and **`If-Unmodified-Since`** will be responded with data only\
  \ if the response header**`Last-Modified`** contains a different time.\n- Conditional requests using **`If-Match`** and\
  \ **`If-None-Match`** use an Etag value so the web server will send the content of the response if the data (Etag) has changed.\
  \ The `Etag` is taken from the HTTP response.\n  - The **Etag** value is usually **calculated based** on the **content**\
  \ of the response. For example, `ETag: W/\"37-eL2g8DEyqntYlaLp5XLInBWsjWI\"` indicates that the `Etag` is the **Sha1** of\
  \ **37 bytes**.\n\n## Range requests\n\n- **`Accept-Ranges`**: Indicates if the server supports range requests, and if so\
  \ in which unit the range can be expressed. `Accept-Ranges: <range-unit>`\n- **`Range`**: Indicates the part of a document\
  \ that the server should return. For emxaple, `Range:80-100` will return the bytes 80 to 100 of the original response with\
  \ a status code of 206 Partial Content. Also remember to remove the `Accept-Encoding` header from the request.\n  - This\
  \ could be useful to get a repsonse with arbitrary reflected javascript code that otherwise could be escaped. But to abuse\
  \ this you would need to inject this headers in the request.\n- **`If-Range`**: Creates a conditional range request that\
  \ is only fulfilled if the given etag or date matches the remote resource. Used to prevent downloading two ranges from incompatible\
  \ version of the resource.\n- **`Content-Range`**: Indicates where in a full body message a partial message belongs.\n\n\
  ## Message body information\n\n- **`Content-Length`:** The size of the resource, in decimal number of bytes.\n- **`Content-Type`**:\
  \ Indicates the media type of the resource\n- **`Content-Encoding`**: Used to specify the compression algorithm.\n- **`Content-Language`**:\
  \ Describes the human language(s) intended for the audience, so that it allows a user to differentiate according to the\
  \ users' own preferred language.\n- **`Content-Location`**: Indicates an alternate location for the returned data.\n\nFrom\
  \ a pentest point of view this information is usually \"useless\", but if the resource is **protected** by a 401 or 403\
  \ and you can find some **way** to **get** this **info**, this could be **interesting.**\\\nFor example a combination of\
  \ **`Range`** and **`Etag`** in a HEAD request can leak the content of the page via HEAD requests:\n\n- A request with the\
  \ header `Range: bytes=20-20` and with a response containing `ETag: W/\"1-eoGvPlkaxxP4HqHv6T3PNhV9g3Y\"` is leaking that\
  \ the SHA1 of the byte 20 is `ETag: eoGvPlkaxxP4HqHv6T3PNhV9g3Y`\n\n## Server Info\n\n- `Server: Apache/2.4.1 (Unix)`\n\
  - `X-Powered-By: PHP/5.3.3`\n\n## Controls\n\n- **`Allow`**: This header is used to communicate the HTTP methods a resource\
  \ can handle. For example, it might be specified as `Allow: GET, POST, HEAD`, indicating that the resource supports these\
  \ methods.\n- **`Expect`**: Utilized by the client to convey expectations that the server needs to meet for the request\
  \ to be processed successfully. A common use case involves the `Expect: 100-continue` header, which signals that the client\
  \ intends to send a large data payload. The client looks for a `100 (Continue)` response before proceeding with the transmission.\
  \ This mechanism helps in optimizing network usage by awaiting server confirmation.\n\n## Downloads\n\n- The **`Content-Disposition`**\
  \ header in HTTP responses directs whether a file should be displayed **inline** (within the webpage) or treated as an **attachment**\
  \ (downloaded). For instance:\n\n```\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"filename.jpg\"\n```\n\nThis means the\
  \ file named \"filename.jpg\" is intended to be downloaded and saved.\n\n## Security Headers\n\n### Content Security Policy\
  \ (CSP) <a href=\"#csp\" id=\"csp\"></a>\n\n\n{{#ref}}\n../../pentesting-web/content-security-policy-csp-bypass/\n{{#endref}}\n\
  \n### **Trusted Types**\n\nBy enforcing Trusted Types through CSP, applications can be protected against DOM XSS attacks.\
  \ Trusted Types ensure that only specifically crafted objects, compliant with established security policies, can be used\
  \ in dangerous web API calls, thereby securing JavaScript code by default.\n\n```javascript\n// Feature detection\nif (window.trustedTypes\
  \ && trustedTypes.createPolicy) {\n  // Name and create a policy\n  const policy = trustedTypes.createPolicy('escapePolicy',\
  \ {\n    createHTML: str => str.replace(/\\</g, '&lt;').replace(/>/g, '&gt;');\n  });\n}\n```\n\n```javascript\n// Assignment\
  \ of raw strings is blocked, ensuring safety.\nel.innerHTML = \"some string\" // Throws an exception.\nconst escaped = policy.createHTML(\"\
  <img src=x onerror=alert(1)>\")\nel.innerHTML = escaped // Results in safe assignment.\n```\n\n### **X-Content-Type-Options**\n\
  \nThis header prevents MIME type sniffing, a practice that could lead to XSS vulnerabilities. It ensures that browsers respect\
  \ the MIME types specified by the server.\n\n```\nX-Content-Type-Options: nosniff\n```\n\n### **X-Frame-Options**\n\nTo\
  \ combat clickjacking, this header restricts how documents can be embedded in `<frame>`, `<iframe>`, `<embed>`, or `<object>`\
  \ tags, recommending all documents to specify their embedding permissions explicitly.\n\n```\nX-Frame-Options: DENY\n```\n\
  \n### **Cross-Origin Resource Policy (CORP) and Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**\n\nCORP is crucial for specifying\
  \ which resources can be loaded by websites, mitigating cross-site leaks. CORS, on the other hand, allows for a more flexible\
  \ cross-origin resource sharing mechanism, relaxing the same-origin policy under certain conditions.\n\n```\nCross-Origin-Resource-Policy:\
  \ same-origin\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: https://example.com\nAccess-Control-Allow-Credentials: true\n```\n\n### **Cross-Origin\
  \ Embedder Policy (COEP) and Cross-Origin Opener Policy (COOP)**\n\nCOEP and COOP are essential for enabling cross-origin\
  \ isolation, significantly reducing the risk of Spectre-like attacks. They control the loading of cross-origin resources\
  \ and the interaction with cross-origin windows, respectively.\n\n```\nCross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp\nCross-Origin-Opener-Policy:\
  \ same-origin-allow-popups\n```\n\n### **HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)**\n\nLastly, HSTS is a security feature that\
  \ forces browsers to communicate with servers only over secure HTTPS connections, thereby enhancing privacy and security.\n\
  \n```\nStrict-Transport-Security: max-age=3153600\n```\n\n### **Permissions-Policy (formerly Feature-Policy)**\n\nPermissions-Policy\
  \ allows web developers to selectively enable, disable, or modify the behaviour of certain browser features and APIs within\
  \ a document. It is the successor to the now-deprecated `Feature-Policy` header. This header helps reduce the attack surface\
  \ by restricting access to powerful features that could be abused.\n\n```\nPermissions-Policy: geolocation=(), camera=(),\
  \ microphone=()\n```\n\n**Common directives:**\n\n| Directive | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `accelerometer` | Controls\
  \ access to the Accelerometer sensor |\n| `camera` | Controls access to video input devices (webcam) |\n| `geolocation`\
  \ | Controls access to the Geolocation API |\n| `gyroscope` | Controls access to the Gyroscope sensor |\n| `magnetometer`\
  \ | Controls access to the Magnetometer sensor |\n| `microphone` | Controls access to audio input devices |\n| `payment`\
  \ | Controls access to the Payment Request API |\n| `usb` | Controls access to the WebUSB API |\n| `fullscreen` | Controls\
  \ access to the Fullscreen API |\n| `autoplay` | Controls whether media can autoplay |\n| `clipboard-read` | Controls access\
  \ to read clipboard content |\n| `clipboard-write` | Controls access to write to the clipboard |\n\n**Syntax values:**\n\
  \n- `()` - Disables the feature entirely\n- `(self)` - Allows the feature only for the same origin\n- `*` - Allows the feature\
  \ for all origins\n- `(self \"https://example.com\")` - Allows for same origin and specified domain\n\n**Example configurations:**\n\
  \n```\n# Restrictive policy - disable most features\nPermissions-Policy: geolocation=(), camera=(), microphone=(), payment=(),\
  \ usb=()\n\n# Allow camera only from same origin\nPermissions-Policy: camera=(self)\n\n# Allow geolocation for same origin\
  \ and a trusted partner\nPermissions-Policy: geolocation=(self \"https://maps.example.com\")\n```\n\nFrom a security perspective,\
  \ missing or overly permissive `Permissions-Policy` headers may allow attackers (e.g., through XSS or embedded iframes)\
  \ to abuse powerful browser features. Always restrict features to the minimum necessary for your application.\n\n## Header\
  \ Name Casing Bypass\n\nHTTP/1.1 defines header field‐names as **case-insensitive** (RFC 9110 §5.1). Nevertheless, it is\
  \ very common to find custom middleware, security filters, or business logic that compare the *literal* header name received\
  \ without normalising the casing first (e.g. `header.equals(\"CamelExecCommandExecutable\")`).  If those checks are performed\
  \ **case-sensitively**, an attacker may bypass them simply by sending the same header with a different capitalisation.\n\
  \nTypical situations where this mistake appears:\n\n* Custom allow/deny lists that try to block “dangerous” internal headers\
  \ before the request reaches a sensitive component.\n* In-house implementations of reverse-proxy pseudo-headers (e.g. `X-Forwarded-For`\
  \ sanitisation).\n* Frameworks that expose management / debug endpoints and rely on header names for authentication or command\
  \ selection.\n\n### Abusing the bypass\n\n1. Identify a header that is filtered or validated server-side (for example, by\
  \ reading source code, documentation, or error messages).\n2. Send the **same header with a different casing** (mixed-case\
  \ or upper-case).  Because HTTP stacks usually canonicalise headers only *after* user code has run, the vulnerable check\
  \ can be skipped.\n3. If the downstream component treats headers in a case-insensitive way (most do), it will accept the\
  \ attacker-controlled value.\n\n### Example: Apache Camel `exec` RCE (CVE-2025-27636)\n\nIn vulnerable versions of Apache\
  \ Camel the *Command Center* routes try to block untrusted requests by stripping the headers `CamelExecCommandExecutable`\
  \ and `CamelExecCommandArgs`.  The comparison was done with `equals()` so only the exact lowercase names were removed.\n\
  \n```bash\n# Bypass the filter by using mixed-case header names and execute `ls /` on the host\ncurl \"http://<IP>/command-center\"\
  \ \\\n  -H \"CAmelExecCommandExecutable: ls\" \\\n  -H \"CAmelExecCommandArgs: /\"\n```\n\nThe headers reach the `exec`\
  \ component unfiltered, resulting in remote command execution with the privileges of the Camel process.\n\n### Detection\
  \ & Mitigation\n\n* Normalise all header names to a single case (usually lowercase) **before** performing allow/deny comparisons.\n\
  * Reject suspicious duplicates: if both `Header:` and `HeAdEr:` are present, treat it as an anomaly.\n* Use a positive allow-list\
  \ enforced **after** canonicalisation.\n* Protect management endpoints with authentication and network segmentation.\n\n\
