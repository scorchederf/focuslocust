_body: "# Evil Twin EAP-TLS\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\nEAP-TLS is the common \"secure\" choice\
  \ for WPA2/3-Enterprise, but two practical weaknesses regularly show up during assessments:\n\n- **Unauthenticated identity\
  \ leakage**: the outer EAP-Response/Identity is sent in cleartext before any TLS tunnel is built, so real domain usernames\
  \ often leak over the air.\n- **Broken client server-validation**: if the supplicant doesn’t strictly verify the RADIUS\
  \ server certificate (or allows users to click through warnings), a rogue AP with a self-signed cert can still onboard victims\
  \ – turning mutual TLS into one-way TLS.\n\n## Unauthenticated EAP identity leakage / username enumeration\n\nEAP drives\
  \ an identity exchange *before* TLS starts. If the client uses the real domain username as its outer identity, anyone in\
  \ RF range can harvest it without authenticating.\n\n**Passive harvest workflow**\n\n```bash\n# 1) Park on the right channel/BSSID\n\
  airodump-ng -i $IFACE -c $CHAN --bssid $BSSID\n\n# 2) Decode EAP frames and extract identities\n# Trigger a client connection\
  \ (e.g., your phone) to see the leak\ntshark -i \"$IFACE\" -Y eap -V | grep \"Identity: *[a-z]\\|*[A-Z]\\|*[0-9]\"\n```\n\
  \nImpact: fast, no-auth username collection → fuels password spraying, phishing, account correlation. Worse when usernames\
  \ match email addresses.\n\n## TLS 1.3 privacy vs downgrade games\n\nTLS 1.3 encrypts client certs and most handshake metadata,\
  \ so when a supplicant *actually* negotiates TLS 1.3, an Evil Twin cannot passively learn the client certificate/identity.\
  \ Many enterprise stacks still allow TLS 1.2 for compatibility; RFC 9190 warns that a rogue AP can offer only TLS 1.2 static-RSA\
  \ suites to force a fallback and re-expose the outer identity (or even the client cert) in cleartext EAP-TLS.\n\n**Offensive\
  \ playbook (downgrade to leak ID):**\n- Compile hostapd-wpe with only TLS 1.2 static RSA ciphers enabled and TLS 1.3 disabled\
  \ in `openssl_ciphersuite` / `ssl_ctx_flags`.\n- Advertise the corporate SSID; when the victim initiates TLS 1.3, respond\
  \ with a TLS alert and restart the handshake so the peer retries with TLS 1.2, revealing its real identity before cert validation\
  \ succeeds.\n- Pair this with `force_authorized=1` in hostapd-wpe so the 4-way handshake completes even if client-auth fails,\
  \ giving you DHCP/DNS-level traffic to phish or portal.\n\n**Defensive toggle (what to look for during an assessment):**\n\
  - hostapd/wpa_supplicant 2.10 added EAP-TLS server *and* peer support for TLS 1.3 but ships it **disabled by default**;\
  \ enabling it on clients with `phase1=\"tls_disable_tlsv1_3=0\"` removes the downgrade window.\n\n### TLS 1.3 realities\
  \ in 2024–2025\n\n- FreeRADIUS 3.0.23+ accepts EAP-TLS 1.3, but clients still break (Windows 11 has no EAP-TLS 1.3 session\
  \ resumption, Android support varies), so many deployments pin `tls_max_version = \"1.2\"` for stability.\n- Windows 11\
  \ enables EAP-TLS 1.3 by default (22H2+), yet failed resumptions and flaky RADIUS stacks often force a fallback to TLS 1.2.\n\
  - RSA key exchange for TLS 1.2 is being deprecated; OpenSSL 3.x drops static-RSA suites at security level ≥2, so a TLS 1.2\
  \ static-RSA rogue needs OpenSSL 1.1.1 with `@SECLEVEL=0` or older.\n\n**Practical version steering during an engagement**\n\
  \n- **Force TLS 1.2 on the rogue** (to leak identities):\n  ```bash\n  # hostapd-wpe.conf\n  ssl_ctx_flags=0\n  openssl_ciphers=RSA+AES:@SECLEVEL=0\
  \   # requires OpenSSL 1.1.1\n  disable_tlsv1_3=1\n  ```\n- **Probe client TLS intolerance**: run two rogues – one advertising\
  \ TLS 1.3-only (`disable_tlsv1=1`, `disable_tlsv1_1=1`, `disable_tlsv1_2=1`) and one TLS 1.2-only. Clients that only join\
  \ the 1.2 BSS are downgradeable.\n- **Watch for fallback in captures**: filter in Wireshark for `tls.handshake.version==0x0303`\
  \ after an initial `ClientHello` with `supported_versions` containing 0x0304; victims that retry 0x0303 are leaking their\
  \ outer ID again.\n\n## Evil Twin via broken server validation (\"mTLS?\")\n\nRogue APs broadcasting the corporate SSID\
  \ can present any certificate. If the client:\n- **doesn’t validate** the server cert, or\n- **prompts the user** and allows\
  \ override of untrusted CAs/self-signed certs,\nthen EAP-TLS stops being mutual. A modified **hostapd/hostapd-wpe** that\
  \ skips client-cert validation (e.g., `SSL_set_verify(..., 0)`) is enough to stand up the Evil Twin.\n\n### Rogue infra\
  \ quick note\n\nOn recent Kali, compile `hostapd-wpe` using hostapd-2.6 (from https://w1.fi/releases/) and install the legacy\
  \ OpenSSL headers first:\n\n```bash\napt-get install libssl1.0-dev\n# patch hostapd-wpe to set verify_peer=0 in SSL_set_verify\
  \ to accept any client cert\n```\n\n### Windows supplicant misconfig pitfalls (GUI/GPO)\n\nKey knobs from the Windows EAP-TLS\
  \ profile:\n- **Verify the server's identity by validating the certificate**\n  - Checked → chain must be trusted; unchecked\
  \ → any self-signed cert is accepted.\n- **Connect to these servers**\n  - Empty → any cert from a trusted CA is accepted;\
  \ set CN/SAN list to pin expected RADIUS names.\n- **Don't prompt user to authorise new servers or trusted certification\
  \ authorities**\n  - Checked → users cannot click through; unchecked → user can trust an untrusted CA/cert and join the\
  \ rogue AP.\n\nObserved outcomes:\n- **Strict validation + no prompts** → rogue cert rejected; Windows logs an event and\
  \ TLS fails (good detection signal).\n- **Validation + user prompt** → user acceptance = successful Evil Twin association.\n\
  - **No validation** → silent Evil Twin association with any cert.\n\n## References\n\n- [EAP-TLS: The most secure option?\
