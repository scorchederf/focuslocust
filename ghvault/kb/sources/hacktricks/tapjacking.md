_body: "# Tapjacking\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n\n## **Basic Information**\n\n**Tapjacking**\
  \ is an attack where a **malicious** **application** is launched and **positions itself on top of a victim application**.\
  \ Once it visibly obscures the victim app, its user interface is designed in such a way as to trick the user to interact\
  \ with it, while it is passing the interaction along to the victim app.\\\nIn effect, it is **blinding the user from knowing\
  \ they are actually performing actions on the victim app**.\n\n### Detection\n\n* Look for **exported activities** in the\
  \ Android manifest (an activity with an intent-filter is exported by default). If an exported activity is protected by a\
  \ permission, the attacking app will need the **same permission**, which limits exploitability.\n* Check the **minimum SDK**\
  \ version `android:minSdkVersion` in `AndroidManifest.xml`. If it is **lower than 30**, older default behaviors may make\
  \ tapjacking easier to exploit.\n* At runtime, use `logcat` to spot blocked touches on Android 12+: the system logs `Untrusted\
  \ touch due to occlusion by <package>` when overlays are filtered.\n\n### Protection\n\n#### Android 12+ default blocking\
  \ & compat flags\n\nAndroid 12 (API 31) introduced **\"Block untrusted touches\"**: touches coming from another UID window\
  \ of type `TYPE_APPLICATION_OVERLAY` (opacity ≥0.8) are dropped. This is enabled by default. During tests you can toggle\
  \ it:\n\n```bash\n# disable blocking for a specific package (for PoC crafting)\nadb shell am compat disable BLOCK_UNTRUSTED_TOUCHES\
  \ com.example.victim\n# re‑enable\nadb shell am compat reset BLOCK_UNTRUSTED_TOUCHES com.example.victim\n```\n\nTrusted\
  \ windows (accessibility, IME, assistant) still receive events. Invisible or fully transparent overlays also bypass the\
  \ block, which attackers try to abuse by keeping `alpha < 0.8`.\n\n#### Handling **partial occlusion**\n\nPartial overlays\
  \ that leave the target area visible are not auto-blocked. Mitigate in sensitive views by rejecting events with the **`FLAG_WINDOW_IS_PARTIALLY_OBSCURED`**\
  \ flag:\n\n```java\n@Override\npublic boolean onFilterTouchEventForSecurity(MotionEvent event) {\n    if ((event.getFlags()\
  \ & MotionEvent.FLAG_WINDOW_IS_PARTIALLY_OBSCURED) != 0) {\n        return false; // drop tap when anything partially obscures\
  \ us\n    }\n    return super.onFilterTouchEventForSecurity(event);\n}\n```\n\n#### `filterTouchesWhenObscured`\n\nIf **`android:filterTouchesWhenObscured`**\
  \ is set to **`true`**, the `View` will not receive touches whenever view's window is obscured by another visible window.\n\
  \n#### **`setFilterTouchesWhenObscured`**\n\nThe attribute **`setFilterTouchesWhenObscured`** set to true can also prevent\
  \ the exploitation of this vulnerability if the Android version is lower.\\\nIf set to **`true`**, for example, a button\
  \ can be automatically **disabled if it is obscured**:\n\n```xml\n<Button android:text=\"Button\"\nandroid:id=\"@+id/button1\"\
  \nandroid:layout_width=\"wrap_content\"\nandroid:layout_height=\"wrap_content\"\nandroid:filterTouchesWhenObscured=\"true\"\
  >\n</Button>\n```\n\n## Exploitation\n\n### Tapjacking-ExportedActivity\n\nThe most **recent Android application** performing\
  \ a Tapjacking attack (+ invoking before an exported activity of the attacked application) can be found in: [**https://github.com/carlospolop/Tapjacking-ExportedActivity**](https://github.com/carlospolop/Tapjacking-ExportedActivity).\n\
  \nFollow the **README instructions to use it**.\n\n### FloatingWindowApp\n\nAn example project implementing **FloatingWindowApp**,\
  \ which can be used to put on top of other activities to perform a clickjacking attack, can be found in [**FloatingWindowApp**](https://github.com/aminography/FloatingWindowApp)\
  \ (a bit old, good luck building the apk).\n\n### Qark\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n> It looks like this project is now unmaintained\
  \ and this functionality isn't properly working anymore\n\nYou can use [**qark**](https://github.com/linkedin/qark) with\
  \ the `--exploit-apk` --sdk-path `/Users/username/Library/Android/sdk` parameters to create a malicious application to test\
  \ for possible **Tapjacking** vulnerabilities.\\\n\nThe mitigation is relatively simple as the developer may choose not\
  \ to receive touch events when a view is covered by another. Using the [Android Developer’s Reference](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View#security):\n\
  \n> Sometimes it is essential that an application be able to verify that an action is being performed with the full knowledge\
  \ and consent of the user, such as granting a permission request, making a purchase or clicking on an advertisement. Unfortunately,\
  \ a malicious application could try to spoof the user into performing these actions, unaware, by concealing the intended\
  \ purpose of the view. As a remedy, the framework offers a touch filtering mechanism that can be used to improve the security\
  \ of views that provide access to sensitive functionality.\n>\n> To enable touch filtering, call [`setFilterTouchesWhenObscured(boolean)`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View#setFilterTouchesWhenObscured%28boolean%29)\
  \ or set the android:filterTouchesWhenObscured layout attribute to true. When enabled, the framework will discard touches\
  \ that are received whenever the view's window is obscured by another visible window. As a result, the view will not receive\
  \ touches whenever a toast, dialog or other window appears above the view's window.\n\n---\n\n### Recent overlay-based malware\
  \ techniques\n\n* **Hook/Ermac variants** use nearly transparent overlays (e.g., fake NFC prompts) to capture gestures and\
  \ lock-screen PINs while forwarding touches underneath, delivered via Accessibility-ATS modules.\n* **Anatsa/TeaBot droppers**\
  \ ship overlays for hundreds of banking/crypto apps and show full-screen \"maintenance\" overlays to stall victims while\
  \ ATS completes transfers.\n* **Hidden-VNC banking RATs** briefly display phishing overlays to capture credentials, then\
  \ rely on covert VNC plus Accessibility to replay taps with fewer on-device artifacts.\n\nPractical takeaway for red teams:\
  \ mix an `alpha < 0.8` overlay to bypass Android 12 blocking, then escalate to a full-screen accessibility overlay once\
  \ the user toggles the service. Instrument `GestureDescription` or a headless VNC to keep control after credentials are\
  \ captured.\n\n---\n\n## Accessibility Overlay Phishing (Banking-Trojan Variant)\n\nBesides classic Tapjacking, modern Android\
  \ banking malware families (e.g. **ToxicPanda**, BrasDex, Sova, etc.) abuse the **Accessibility Service** to place a full-screen\
  \ WebView **overlay** above the legitimate application while still being able to **forward the user input** to the view\
  \ underneath.  This dramatically increases believability and allows attackers to steal credentials, OTPs or even automate\
  \ fraudulent transactions.\n\n### How it works\n1. The malicious APK requests the highly-sensitive `BIND_ACCESSIBILITY_SERVICE`\
  \ permission, usually hiding the request behind a fake Google/Chrome/PDF-viewer dialog.\n2. Once the user enables the service,\
  \ the malware programmatically simulates the taps required to grant additional dangerous permissions (`READ_SMS`, `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW`,\
  \ `REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES`, …).\n3. A **WebView** is inflated and added to the window manager using the **`TYPE_ACCESSIBILITY_OVERLAY`**\
  \ window type.  The overlay can be rendered totally opaque or semi-transparent and can be flagged as *“through”* so that\
  \ the original touches are still delivered to the background activity (thus the transaction really happens while the victim\
  \ only sees the phishing form).\n\n```java\nWebView phishingView = new WebView(getApplicationContext());\nphishingView.getSettings().setJavaScriptEnabled(true);\n\
  phishingView.loadUrl(\"file:///android_asset/bank_login.html\");\n\nWindowManager wm = (WindowManager) getSystemService(WINDOW_SERVICE);\n\
  WindowManager.LayoutParams lp = new WindowManager.LayoutParams(\n        WindowManager.LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT,\n    \
  \    WindowManager.LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT,\n        WindowManager.LayoutParams.TYPE_ACCESSIBILITY_OVERLAY,  // <-- bypasses\
  \ SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW prompt\n        WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_NOT_FOCUSABLE |\n        WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_NOT_TOUCH_MODAL,\
  \        // «through» flag → forward touches\n        PixelFormat.TRANSLUCENT);\nwm.addView(phishingView, lp);\n```\n\n\
  ### Typical workflow used by banking Trojans\n* Query installed packages (`QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES`) to figure out which banking\
  \ / wallet app is currently opened.\n* Download an **HTML/JS overlay template** from the C2 that perfectly imitates that\
  \ specific application (Logo, colours, i18n strings…).\n* Display the overlay, harvest credentials/PIN/pattern.\n* Use the\
  \ **Accessibility API** (`performGlobalAction`, `GestureDescription`) to automate transfers in the background.\n\n### Detection\
  \ & Mitigation\n* Audit the list of installed apps with `adb shell pm list packages -3 -e BIND_ACCESSIBILITY_SERVICE`.\n\
  * From the application side (bank / wallet):\n  - Enable **`android:accessibilityDataSensitive=\"accessibilityDataPrivateYes\"\
  `** (Android 14+) on sensitive views to block non-Play-Store services.\n  - Combine with `setFilterTouchesWhenObscured(true)`\
  \ and `FLAG_SECURE`.\n\nFor additional details on leveraging Accessibility Services for full remote device control (e.g.\
  \ PlayPraetor, SpyNote, etc.) see:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\naccessibility-services-abuse.md\n{{#endref}}\n\n## References\n* [Android\
