_body: "# Double Free\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n## Basic Information\n\nIf you free a block\
  \ of memory more than once, it can mess up the allocator's data and open the door to attacks. Here's how it happens: when\
  \ you free a block of memory, it goes back into a list of free chunks (e.g. the \"fast bin\"). If you free the same block\
  \ twice in a row, the allocator detects this and throws an error. But if you **free another chunk in between, the double-free\
  \ check is bypassed**, causing corruption.\n\nNow, when you ask for new memory (using `malloc`), the allocator might give\
  \ you a **block that's been freed twice**. This can lead to two different pointers pointing to the same memory location.\
  \ If an attacker controls one of those pointers, they can change the contents of that memory, which can cause security issues\
  \ or even allow them to execute code.\n\nExample:\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nint main() {\n   \
  \ // Allocate memory for three chunks\n    char *a = (char *)malloc(10);\n    char *b = (char *)malloc(10);\n    char *c\
  \ = (char *)malloc(10);\n    char *d = (char *)malloc(10);\n    char *e = (char *)malloc(10);\n    char *f = (char *)malloc(10);\n\
  \    char *g = (char *)malloc(10);\n    char *h = (char *)malloc(10);\n    char *i = (char *)malloc(10);\n\n    // Print\
  \ initial memory addresses\n    printf(\"Initial allocations:\\n\");\n    printf(\"a: %p\\n\", (void *)a);\n    printf(\"\
  b: %p\\n\", (void *)b);\n    printf(\"c: %p\\n\", (void *)c);\n    printf(\"d: %p\\n\", (void *)d);\n    printf(\"e: %p\\\
  n\", (void *)e);\n    printf(\"f: %p\\n\", (void *)f);\n    printf(\"g: %p\\n\", (void *)g);\n    printf(\"h: %p\\n\", (void\
  \ *)h);\n    printf(\"i: %p\\n\", (void *)i);\n\n    // Fill tcache\n    free(a);\n    free(b);\n    free(c);\n    free(d);\n\
  \    free(e);\n    free(f);\n    free(g);\n\n    // Introduce double-free vulnerability in fast bin\n    free(h);\n    free(i);\n\
  \    free(h);\n\n\n    // Reallocate memory and print the addresses\n    char *a1 = (char *)malloc(10);\n    char *b1 =\
  \ (char *)malloc(10);\n    char *c1 = (char *)malloc(10);\n    char *d1 = (char *)malloc(10);\n    char *e1 = (char *)malloc(10);\n\
  \    char *f1 = (char *)malloc(10);\n    char *g1 = (char *)malloc(10);\n    char *h1 = (char *)malloc(10);\n    char *i1\
  \ = (char *)malloc(10);\n    char *i2 = (char *)malloc(10);\n\n    // Print initial memory addresses\n    printf(\"After\
  \ reallocations:\\n\");\n    printf(\"a1: %p\\n\", (void *)a1);\n    printf(\"b1: %p\\n\", (void *)b1);\n    printf(\"c1:\
  \ %p\\n\", (void *)c1);\n    printf(\"d1: %p\\n\", (void *)d1);\n    printf(\"e1: %p\\n\", (void *)e1);\n    printf(\"f1:\
  \ %p\\n\", (void *)f1);\n    printf(\"g1: %p\\n\", (void *)g1);\n    printf(\"h1: %p\\n\", (void *)h1);\n    printf(\"i1:\
  \ %p\\n\", (void *)i1);\n    printf(\"i2: %p\\n\", (void *)i2);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, after filling\
  \ the tcache with several freed chunks (7), the code **frees chunk `h`, then chunk `i`, and then `h` again, causing a double\
  \ free** (also known as Fast Bin dup). This opens the possibility of receiving overlapping memory addresses when reallocating,\
  \ meaning two or more pointers can point to the same memory location. Manipulating data through one pointer can then affect\
  \ the other, creating a critical security risk and potential for exploitation.\n\nExecuting it, note how **`i1` and `i2`\
  \ got the same address**:\n\n<pre><code>Initial allocations:\na: 0xaaab0f0c22a0\nb: 0xaaab0f0c22c0\nc: 0xaaab0f0c22e0\n\
  d: 0xaaab0f0c2300\ne: 0xaaab0f0c2320\nf: 0xaaab0f0c2340\ng: 0xaaab0f0c2360\nh: 0xaaab0f0c2380\ni: 0xaaab0f0c23a0\nAfter\
  \ reallocations:\na1: 0xaaab0f0c2360\nb1: 0xaaab0f0c2340\nc1: 0xaaab0f0c2320\nd1: 0xaaab0f0c2300\ne1: 0xaaab0f0c22e0\nf1:\
  \ 0xaaab0f0c22c0\ng1: 0xaaab0f0c22a0\nh1: 0xaaab0f0c2380\n<strong>i1: 0xaaab0f0c23a0\n</strong><strong>i2: 0xaaab0f0c23a0\n\
  </strong></code></pre>\n\n## Examples\n\n- [**Dragon Army. Hack The Box**](https://7rocky.github.io/en/ctf/htb-challenges/pwn/dragon-army/)\n\
  \  - We can only allocate Fast-Bin-sized chunks except for size `0x70`, which prevents the usual `__malloc_hook` overwrite.\n\
  \  - Instead, we use PIE addresses that start with `0x56` as a target for Fast Bin dup (1/2 chance).\n  - One place where\
  \ PIE addresses are stored is in `main_arena`, which is inside Glibc and near `__malloc_hook`\n  - We target a specific\
  \ offset of `main_arena` to allocate a chunk there and continue allocating chunks until reaching `__malloc_hook` to get\
  \ code execution.\n- [**zero_to_hero. PicoCTF**](https://7rocky.github.io/en/ctf/picoctf/binary-exploitation/zero_to_hero/)\n\
  \  - Using Tcache bins and a null-byte overflow, we can achieve a double-free situation:\n    - We allocate three chunks\
  \ of size `0x110` (`A`, `B`, `C`)\n    - We free `B`\n    - We free `A` and allocate again to use the null-byte overflow\n\
  \    - Now `B`'s size field is `0x100`, instead of `0x111`, so we can free it again\n    - We have one Tcache-bin of size\
  \ `0x110` and one of size `0x100` that point to the same address. So we have a double free.\n  - We leverage the double\
  \ free using [Tcache poisoning](tcache-bin-attack.md)\n\n## References\n\n- [https://heap-exploitation.dhavalkapil.com/attacks/double_free](https://heap-exploitation.dhavalkapil.com/attacks/double_free)\n\
