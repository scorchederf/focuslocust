  \ DApp is a decentralized application that runs on a peer-to-peer network, rather than being hosted on a centralized server.\
  \ DApps are typically built on **blockchain technology**, which should allow for transparency, security, and immutability\
  \ of data.\n\n## Web3 DApp Architecture\n\nAccording to [**this post**](https://www.certik.com/resources/blog/web2-meets-web3-hacking-decentralized-applications)\
  \ there are 3 different types of Web3 DApps architecture:\n\n### \"API-less\" DApps\n\nThese DApps are built on top of a\
  \ blockchain and do not rely on any centralized APIs or backend. You could think that the blockchain is the actual backend\
  \ of the application. They are **fully decentralized** and can be accessed directly through the blockchain.\n\nIn order\
  \ to interact with the blockchain the client will usually use a **wallet**. The wallet will sign the transactions and send\
  \ them to the blockchain. The client might also use a **node** to read data from the blockchain.\n\n### \"API-Enabled\"\
  \ DApps\n\nThese DApps are built on top of a blockchain but also rely on centralized APIs usually to gather information.\
  \ They are **mostly decentralized** because even if they rely on a centralized API, the core functionality of the DApp is\
  \ still on the blockchain. The communication of the client with the blockchain is usually done through a **wallet**.\n\n\
  A good example of this type of DApp is a **NFT minting application**. The server allows images to be uploaded but the minting\
  \ is done by the client through a wallet.\n\n### \"Full-Scale\" DApps\n\nThese DApps are built on top of a blockchain but\
  \ also rely on centralized APIs and backend servers. They **could be partially decentralized** as the client might be able\
  \ to perform operations on the blockchain using a wallet. However, usually the **backend will also be able to perform operations\
  \ on the blockchain**.\n\nA good example for this type of DApp is a cross-chain bridge where an offchain component is needed\
  \ to **communicate with both smart contracts in different blockchains** to perform the transfer of assets.\n\n## Web2 vulnerabilities\n\
  \nWeb2 vulnerabilities still affect these kinds of applications although their impact might vary:\n\n- **Client side vulnerabilities**\
  \ have an increased impact as in the Web3 DApps the client is usually the one **performing the operations on the blockchain**\
  \ through a wallet. This means that attacks like XSS that manage to execute JS code on the client side or that tampers with\
  \ the content of the page can have a bigger impact as they can **interact with the wallet** and convince the user to perform\
  \ undesired operations on the blockchain.\n   - Note that usually even in these kinds of applications the client can still\
  \ review the operations before signing them with the wallet. However, if the attacker is able to tamper with the content\
  \ of the page, it can convince the user to sign a transaction that will perform an undesired operation on the blockchain.\n\
  - **Server side vulnerabilities** are still present in the DApps that rely on a backend server. The impact of these vulnerabilities\
  \ will depend on the architecture of the DApp. However, they could still be very problematic as an attacker might find in\
  \ the backend **keys of the company** to access the funds of smart contracts, or could perform account takeover that might\
  \ allow them to steal funds or NFTs from the users.\n- **Supply chain compromises** in frontend dependencies, wallet SDKs,\
  \ analytics snippets, or CDN-hosted assets can be catastrophic in Web3. Tampering with a signing modal, a wallet connector,\
  \ or transaction-building helper can silently replace calldata, destination addresses, spender addresses, or the `operation`\
  \ type right before the wallet prompt appears.\n\nOf course, if the DApp is not using a backend or the backend used only\
  \ offers public chain data or static pages, the attack surface of the DApp is reduced.\n\n## Web3 attack surface\n\nEven\
  \ if in general a DApp has a reduced attack surface as several security checks are always done on the blockchain, there\
  \ are still some attack vectors that can be exploited by an attacker.\n\nIt might be possible to group web3 DApps vulnerabilities\
  \ in the following categories:\n\n- **Mishandled On-Chain Transactions**: incorrectly formatted or unrestricted transaction\
  \ APIs, lack of response-waiting and block-confirmation logic, exposure of sensitive data, and improper handling of failed,\
  \ reverted, or internally-typed transactions that allow malicious calldata injections.\n\n- **Smart-Contract-Driven Backend\
  \ Attacks**: storing or syncing sensitive data between contracts and databases without validation, unchecked event emissions\
  \ or contract addresses, and exploitable contract vulnerabilities that can poison backend logic.\n\n- **Flawed Crypto-Asset\
  \ Operations**: misprocessing different token types (native vs. ERC-20), ignoring decimal precision, failed transfers or\
  \ internal transactions, and accepting fake, deflationary, rebase, or slippage-prone tokens without validation, enabling\
  \ payload injections via token metadata.\n\n- **Wallet / Provider Trust Boundary Failures**: trusting `window.ethereum`,\
  \ WalletConnect session metadata, chain-switch prompts, or injected provider discovery without validation. A malicious extension,\
  \ a spoofed wallet object, or a compromised dependency can alter provider methods, transaction parameters, icons, or wallet\
  \ identity and route the user through an attacker-controlled signing flow.\n\n- **Signature-Based Authorization Abuse**:\
  \ treating `eth_sign`, `personal_sign`, `eth_signTypedData_v4`, `permit`, or similar off-chain authorizations as \"harmless\"\
  . In practice, these signatures can grant allowances, approve relayers, authorize gasless actions, or satisfy backend workflows\
  \ without the user ever seeing an on-chain approval transaction.\n\n- **RPC / Indexer / Finality Assumptions**: assuming\
  \ that the latest log, receipt, or backend index is final. DApps that credit balances, mint rewards, unlock bridge assets,\
  \ or update off-chain state from unconfirmed events can be abused during reorgs, inconsistent RPC views, or by poisoning\
  \ custom indexer pipelines.\n\n- **Bundler / Relayer / Paymaster Abuse**: sponsored transactions and account abstraction\
  \ move part of the trust boundary off-chain. Any API that accepts arbitrary `UserOperation`, pays gas on behalf of users,\
  \ or relays signatures for execution becomes a target for gas-drain, policy-bypass, and replay-style abuse.\n\n### Frontend,\
  \ provider and wallet discovery abuse\n\nModern DApps often assume that the wallet/provider layer is just plumbing, but\
  \ this is an attack surface by itself:\n\n- **Injected provider confusion**: historically many DApps trusted whatever appeared\
  \ in `window.ethereum`. With multiple extensions installed, the \"last injector wins\" problem and wallet impersonation\
  \ become realistic attack paths.\n- **EIP-6963 abuse cases**: EIP-6963 improves multi-wallet discovery, but the spec explicitly\
  \ calls out **provider-object tampering**, **wallet imitation/manipulation**, and even **malicious SVG icons** as security\
  \ concerns. During pentests, check whether the DApp pins a provider by stable wallet metadata and whether two announced\
  \ providers can reuse or tamper with the same identifiers.\n- **WalletConnect / session phishing**: if the application or\
  \ wallet does not validate the real origin against the claimed metadata, a phishing domain can still present a believable\
  \ session request. This is especially relevant when the workflow is \"connect wallet first, inspect later\".\n- **Blind\
  \ chain switching**: some flows request `wallet_switchEthereumChain` and immediately build a transaction assuming the switch\
  \ succeeded. If the application keeps stale provider state or mixes RPCs from different chains, users can sign transactions\
  \ against the wrong network context.\n\nWhen reviewing a DApp, treat the wallet connection layer exactly like an authentication\
  \ boundary: inspect provider discovery, event handling (`accountsChanged`, `chainChanged`), transaction building after chain\
  \ switches, and whether external wallet metadata is reflected in the DOM without sanitization.\n\n{{#ref}}\n../blockchain/blockchain-and-crypto-currencies/web3-signing-workflow-compromise-safe-delegatecall-proxy-takeover.md\n\
  {{#endref}}\n\n### Signature-based approvals and gasless abuse\n\nIn many DApps, the most dangerous action is no longer\
  \ an on-chain `approve`, but an off-chain signature that a relayer or router later cashes in.\n\n- **`permit` / signature\
  \ approvals**: ERC-2612 allows changing `allowance` with a signed message. That means a phishing page or a compromised frontend\
  \ can ask the victim to sign an approval that is later submitted by any relayer.\n- **Relayer optionality**: the ERC-2612\
  \ spec explicitly notes that a relayer gets a free option to submit or withhold a signed permit until `deadline`, so backend\
  \ workflows that assume \"signature received == action already happened\" are wrong.\n- **Typed-data UX gaps**: wallets\
  \ may render the domain and field names but still fail to explain the actual effect of the signature, especially when nested\
  \ calldata, routers, or multicalls are involved.\n- **Permit-drainer pattern**: instead of asking for a visible `approve`,\
  \ drainers increasingly prefer typed-data signatures that authorize a spender or relay path, because they are faster, cheaper,\
  \ and less suspicious to the victim.\n\nFrom a tester perspective, search the frontend and backend for `permit`, `permit2`,\
  \ `eth_signTypedData`, `personal_sign`, `isValidSignature`, and any API that stores signatures for later broadcast. Confirm\
  \ that nonces, deadlines, chain/domain separation, spender binding, and intended execution path are actually validated server-side\
  \ or on-chain.\n\n### Off-chain state, finality and indexer desynchronization\n\nDApps usually do not read raw chain state\
  \ directly for every action. They rely on RPC providers, webhooks, indexers, caches, and message queues. This introduces\
  \ new exploitation opportunities:\n\n- **Reorg-sensitive accounting**: if the backend credits a deposit, bridge transfer,\
  \ or in-game balance on the first seen event instead of after enough confirmations/finality, the user may get spendable\
  \ off-chain credit from a transaction that disappears after a reorg.\n- **RPC split-brain**: one component may simulate\
  \ a call with one RPC endpoint while another component watches logs or broadcasts through a different provider. Inconsistent\
  \ mempool visibility, lagging nodes, or chain-specific quirks can create race conditions or logic bypasses.\n- **Indexer\
  \ poisoning**: custom indexers that trust every emitted event or decode logs without validating the emitting contract/address\
  \ can import attacker-controlled data into databases, leaderboards, bridge pipelines, or reward systems.\n- **Unsafe replay\
  \ of backend actions**: webhook-driven bots, settlement workers, or queue consumers often assume event processing is idempotent.\
  \ If the same event can be replayed after retries or reorg rewinds, value-moving actions may execute more than once.\n\n\
  When attacking this layer, review how the DApp handles confirmations, reorg rollbacks, duplicate deliveries, and contract-address\
  \ allowlists in event consumers. Recent production guidance for blockchain indexers stresses that forward-filling indexers\
  \ must be reorg-aware and able to rewind to the common ancestor instead of treating the current tip as immutable.\n\nSome\
  \ examples from [**this post**](https://www.certik.com/resources/blog/web2-meets-web3-hacking-decentralized-applications):\n\
  \n### Wasting Funds: Forcing backend to perform transactions\n\nIn the scenario **`Wasted Crypto in Gas via Unrestricted\
  \ API`**, the attacker can force the backend to call functions of a smart contract that will consume gas. The attacker,\
  \ just sending an ETH account number and with no limits, will force backend to call the smart contract to register it, which\
  \ will consume gas.\n\n### DoS: Poor transaction handling time\n\nIn the scenario **`Poor Transaction Time Handling Leads\
  \ to DoS`**, it is explained that because the backend will keep the HTTP request open until a transaction is performed,\
  \ a user can easily send several HTTP requests to the backend, which will consume all the resources of the backend and will\
  \ lead to a DoS.\n\n### Backend<-->Blockchain desync - Race condition\n\nIn the scenario **`Poor Transaction Time Handling\
  \ Leads to Race Condition`**, it is explained that in a game it was possible for the user to send a withdrawal request to\
  \ the backend which would send the user coins, but while the transaction was still being processed, the user was able to\
  \ use those coins to purchase items in the game, getting them for free.\n\nAnother example could be to use the same coins\
  \ to purchase different items as the backend is immediately giving the item to the user without waiting for the transaction\
  \ to be confirmed and therefore waiting for the user balance in the blockchain to be reduced.\n\n### Smart contract address\
  \ validation\n\nIn the scenario **`Bridge Backend Lacks Smart Contract Address Validation`** it is explained how the backend\
  \ was not properly checking the address of the smart contract, so it was possible for an attacker to deploy a fake smart\
  \ contract, put funds on it, send the transaction to the backend and the backend would think that the user sent funds to\
  \ the real smart contract and would give the user the tokens.\n\n### Mishandling of Asset Classes\n\nIn the scenario **`Mishandling\
  \ of Asset Classes`**, it is explained that the backend confused a scam NFT in an address with 1 MATIC, therefore allowing\
  \ an attacker to send hundreds of scam NFTs to the address and get 1 MATIC from the platform for each of them.\n\n### Sponsored\
  \ transaction / AA backend abuse\n\nMore recent DApps may expose relayer, bundler, or paymaster APIs to sponsor user actions.\
  \ These systems introduce a classic Web2 abuse surface around a Web3 execution engine:\n\n- If the backend signs or sponsors\
  \ **arbitrary calldata** or **arbitrary `UserOperation` objects**, an attacker may convert the API into a gas-burning primitive\
  \ or a privileged execution oracle.\n- If validation only checks \"this looks like our frontend submitted it\", XSS or a\
  \ compromised dependency can turn the victim browser into a signer for attacker-chosen sponsored actions.\n- If the system\
  \ trusts that a later execution revert will undo the economic impact, it may still be exploitable because gas is already\
  \ spent or the sponsor balance was already charged.\n\nKeep this page generic, but note that account-abstraction-specific\
  \ bugs are covered in more detail here:\n\n{{#ref}}\n../blockchain/blockchain-and-crypto-currencies/erc-4337-smart-account-security-pitfalls.md\n\
