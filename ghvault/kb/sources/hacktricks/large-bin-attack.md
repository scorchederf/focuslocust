_body: "# Large Bin Attack\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n## Basic Information\n\nFor more information\
  \ about what is a large bin check this page:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nbins-and-memory-allocations.md\n{{#endref}}\n\nIt's possible\
  \ to find a great example in [**how2heap - large bin attack**](https://github.com/shellphish/how2heap/blob/master/glibc_2.35/large_bin_attack.c).\n\
  \nBasically here you can see how, in the latest \"current\" version of glibc (2.35), it's not checked: **`P->bk_nextsize`**\
  \ allowing to modify an arbitrary address with the value of a large bin chunk if certain conditions are met.\n\nIn that\
  \ example you can find the following conditions:\n\n- A large chunk is allocated\n- A large chunk smaller than the first\
  \ one but in the same index is allocated\n  - Must be smalled so in the bin it must go first\n- (A chunk to prevent merging\
  \ with the top chunk is created)\n- Then, the first large chunk is freed and a new chunk bigger than it is allocated ->\
  \ Chunk1 goes to the large bin\n- Then, the second large chunk is freed\n- Now, the vulnerability: The attacker can modify\
  \ `chunk1->bk_nextsize` to `[target-0x20]`\n- Then, a larger chunk than chunk 2 is allocated, so chunk2 is inserted in the\
  \ large bin overwriting the address `chunk1->bk_nextsize->fd_nextsize` with the address of chunk2\n\n> [!TIP]\n> There are\
  \ other potential scenarios, the thing is to add to the large bin a chunk that is **smaller** than a current X chunk in\
  \ the bin, so it need to be inserted just before it in the bin, and we need to be able to modify X's **`bk_nextsize`** as\
  \ thats where the address of the smaller chunk will be written to.\n\nThis is the relevant code from malloc. Comments have\
  \ been added to understand better how the address was overwritten:\n\n```c\n/* if smaller than smallest, bypass loop below\
  \ */\nassert (chunk_main_arena (bck->bk));\nif ((unsigned long) (size) < (unsigned long) chunksize_nomask (bck->bk))\n \
  \ {\n    fwd = bck; // fwd = p1\n    bck = bck->bk; // bck = p1->bk\n\n    victim->fd_nextsize = fwd->fd; // p2->fd_nextsize\
  \ = p1->fd (Note that p1->fd is p1 as it's the only chunk)\n    victim->bk_nextsize = fwd->fd->bk_nextsize; // p2->bk_nextsize\
  \ = p1->fd->bk_nextsize\n    fwd->fd->bk_nextsize = victim->bk_nextsize->fd_nextsize = victim; // p1->fd->bk_nextsize->fd_nextsize\
  \ = p2\n  }\n```\n\nThis could be used to **overwrite the `global_max_fast` global variable** of libc to then exploit a\
  \ fast bin attack with larger chunks.\n\nYou can find another great explanation of this attack in [**guyinatuxedo**](https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/32-largebin_attack/largebin_explanation0/index.html).\n\
  \n### Other examples\n\n- [**La casa de papel. HackOn CTF 2024**](https://7rocky.github.io/en/ctf/other/hackon-ctf/la-casa-de-papel/)\n\
  \  - Large bin attack in the same situation as it appears in [**how2heap**](https://github.com/shellphish/how2heap/blob/master/glibc_2.35/large_bin_attack.c).\n\
  \  - The write primitive is more complex, because `global_max_fast` is useless here.\n  - FSOP is needed to finish the exploit.\n\
