  \nSIP (Session Initiation Protocol) is a **signaling and call control protocol** widely used for establishing, modifying,\
  \ and terminating multimedia sessions, including voice, video, and instant messaging, over IP networks. Developed by the\
  \ **Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)**, SIP is defined in **RFC 3261** and has become the de facto standard for VoIP\
  \ and unified communications.\n\nSome key features of SIP include:\n\n1. **Text-based Protocol**: SIP is a text-based protocol,\
  \ which makes it human-readable and easier to debug. It is based on a request-response model, similar to HTTP, and uses\
  \ methods like INVITE, ACK, BYE, and CANCEL for controlling call sessions.\n2. **Scalability and Flexibility**: SIP is highly\
  \ scalable and can be used in small-scale deployments as well as large enterprise and carrier-grade environments. It can\
  \ be easily extended with new features, making it adaptable to various use cases and requirements.\n3. **Interoperability**:\
  \ SIP's widespread adoption and standardization ensure better interoperability between different devices, applications,\
  \ and service providers, promoting seamless communication across various platforms.\n4. **Modular Design**: SIP works with\
  \ other protocols like **RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol)** for media transmission and **SDP (Session Description Protocol)**\
  \ for describing multimedia sessions. This modular design allows for greater flexibility and compatibility with different\
  \ media types and codecs.\n5. **Proxy and Redirect Servers**: SIP can use proxy and redirect servers to facilitate call\
  \ routing and provide advanced features like call forwarding, call transfer, and voicemail services.\n6. **Presence and\
  \ Instant Messaging**: SIP is not limited to voice and video communication. It also supports presence and instant messaging,\
  \ enabling a wide range of unified communication applications.\n\nDespite its many advantages, SIP can be complex to configure\
  \ and manage, particularly when dealing with NAT traversal and firewall issues. However, its versatility, scalability, and\
  \ extensive support across the industry make it a popular choice for VoIP and multimedia communication.\n\n### SIP Methods\n\
  \nThe core SIP methods defined in **RFC 3261** include:\n\n1. **INVITE**: Used to **initiate a new session (call)** or modify\
  \ an existing one. The INVITE method carries the session description (typically using SDP) to inform the recipient about\
  \ the details of the proposed session, such as media types, codecs, and transport protocols.\n2. **ACK**: Sent to **confirm\
  \ the receipt** of a final response to an INVITE request. The ACK method ensures the reliability of INVITE transactions\
  \ by providing end-to-end acknowledgement.\n3. **BYE**: Used to **terminate an established session (call)**. The BYE method\
  \ is sent by either party in the session to indicate that they wish to end the communication.\n4. **CANCEL**: Sent to **cancel\
  \ a pending INVITE** request before the session is established. The CANCEL method allows the sender to abort an INVITE transaction\
  \ if they change their mind or if there is no response from the recipient.\n5. **OPTIONS**: Used to **query the capabilities\
  \ of a SIP server or user agent**. The OPTIONS method can be sent to request information about supported methods, media\
  \ types, or other extensions without actually establishing a session.\n6. **REGISTER**: Used by a user agent to **register\
  \ its current location with a SIP registrar server**. The REGISTER method helps in maintaining an up-to-date mapping between\
  \ a user's SIP URI and their current IP address, enabling call routing and delivery.\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> Note that to call\
  \ someone it's **not neccesary to use the REGISTER** for anything.\\\n> However, it's possible that in order to perform\
  \ an **INVITE** the caller needs to **authenticate** first or he will receive a **`401 Unauthorized`** response.\n\nIn addition\
  \ to these core methods, there are **several SIP extension methods** defined in other RFCs, such as:\n\n1. **SUBSCRIBE**:\
  \ Defined in RFC 6665, the SUBSCRIBE method is used to **request notifications** about the state of a specific resource,\
  \ such as a user's presence or call status.\n2. **NOTIFY**: Also defined in RFC 6665, the NOTIFY method is sent by a server\
  \ to **inform a subscribed user agent** about changes in the state of a monitored resource.\n3. **REFER**: Defined in RFC\
  \ 3515, the REFER method is used to **request that the recipient performs a transfer or refers to a third party**. This\
  \ is typically used for **call transfer** scenarios.\n4. **MESSAGE**: Defined in RFC 3428, the MESSAGE method is used to\
  \ **send instant messages between SIP user agents**, enabling text-based communication within the SIP framework.\n5. **UPDATE**:\
  \ Defined in RFC 3311, the UPDATE method allows **modifying a session without affecting the state of the existing dialog**.\
  \ This is useful for updating session parameters, such as codecs or media types, during an ongoing call.\n6. **PUBLISH**:\
  \ Defined in RFC 3903, the PUBLISH method is used by a user agent to **publish event state information to a server**, making\
  \ it available to other interested parties.\n\n### SIP Response Codes\n\n- **1xx (Provisional Responses)**: These responses\
  \ indicate that the request was received, and the server is continuing to process it.\n  - 100 Trying: The request was received,\
  \ and the server is working on it.\n  - 180 Ringing: The callee is being alerted and will take the call.\n  - 183 Session\
  \ Progress: Provides information about the progress of the call.\n- **2xx (Successful Responses)**: These responses indicate\
  \ that the request was successfully received, understood, and accepted.\n  - 200 OK: The request was successful, and the\
  \ server has fulfilled it.\n  - 202 Accepted: The request was accepted for processing, but it hasn't been completed yet.\n\
  - **3xx (Redirection Responses)**: These responses indicate that further action is required to fulfill the request, typically\
  \ by contacting an alternate resource.\n  - 300 Multiple Choices: There are multiple options available, and the user or\
  \ client must choose one.\n  - 301 Moved Permanently: The requested resource has been assigned a new permanent URI.\n  -\
  \ 302 Moved Temporarily: The requested resource is temporarily available at a different URI.\n  - 305 Use Proxy: The request\
  \ must be sent to a specified proxy.\n- **4xx (Client Error Responses)**: These responses indicate that the request contains\
  \ bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled by the server.\n  - 400 Bad Request: The request was malformed or invalid.\n  - 401\
  \ Unauthorized: The request requires user authentication.\n  - 403 Forbidden: The server understood the request but refuses\
  \ to fulfill it.\n  - 404 Not Found: The requested resource was not found on the server.\n  - 408 Request Timeout: The server\
  \ did not receive a complete request within the time it was prepared to wait.\n  - 486 Busy Here: The callee is currently\
  \ busy and unable to take the call.\n- **5xx (Server Error Responses)**: These responses indicate that the server failed\
  \ to fulfill a valid request.\n  - 500 Internal Server Error: The server encountered an error while processing the request.\n\
  \  - 501 Not Implemented: The server does not support the functionality required to fulfill the request.\n  - 503 Service\
  \ Unavailable: The server is currently unable to handle the request due to maintenance or overload.\n- **6xx (Global Failure\
  \ Responses)**: These responses indicate that the request cannot be fulfilled by any server.\n  - 600 Busy Everywhere: All\
  \ possible destinations for the call are busy.\n  - 603 Decline: The callee does not wish to participate in the call.\n\
  \  - 604 Does Not Exist Anywhere: The requested resource is not available anywhere in the network.\n\n## Examples\n\n###\

  \ sip:jdoe@example.com SIP/2.0` - This line indicates the method (INVITE), the request URI (sip:[jdoe@example.com](mailto:jdoe@example.com)),\
  \ and the SIP version (SIP/2.0).\n2. **Via**: `Via: SIP/2.0/UDP pc33.example.com;branch=z9hG4bK776asdhds` - The Via header\
  \ specifies the transport protocol (UDP) and the client's address (pc33.example.com). The \"branch\" parameter is used for\
  \ loop detection and transaction matching.\n3. **Max-Forwards**: `Max-Forwards: 70` - This header field limits the number\
  \ of times the request can be forwarded by proxies to avoid infinite loops.\n4. **To**: `To: John Doe <sip:jdoe@example.com>`\
  \ - The To header specifies the recipient of the call, including their display name (John Doe) and SIP URI (sip:[jdoe@example.com](mailto:jdoe@example.com)).\n\
  5. **From**: `From: Jane Smith <sip:jsmith@example.org>;tag=1928301774` - The From header specifies the sender of the call,\
  \ including their display name (Jane Smith) and SIP URI (sip:[jsmith@example.org](mailto:jsmith@example.org)). The \"tag\"\
  \ parameter is used to uniquely identify the sender's role in the dialog.\n6. **Call-ID**: `Call-ID: a84b4c76e66710` - The\
  \ Call-ID header uniquely identifies a call session between two user agents.\n7. **CSeq**: `CSeq: 314159 INVITE` - The CSeq\
  \ header contains a sequence number and the method used in the request. It's used to match responses to requests and detect\
  \ out-of-order messages.\n8. **Contact**: `Contact: <sip:jsmith@pc33.example.com>` - The Contact header provides a direct\
  \ route to the sender, which can be used for subsequent requests and responses.\n9. **User-Agent**: `User-Agent: ExampleSIPClient/1.0`\
  \ - The User-Agent header provides information about the software or hardware of the sender, including its name and version.\n\
  10. **Allow**: `Allow: INVITE, ACK, CANCEL, OPTIONS, BYE, REFER, NOTIFY, MESSAGE, SUBSCRIBE, INFO` - The Allow header lists\
  \ the SIP methods supported by the sender. This helps the recipient understand which methods can be used during the communication.\n\
  11. **Content-Type**: `Content-Type: application/sdp` - The Content-Type header specifies the media type of the message\
  \ body, in this case, SDP (Session Description Protocol).\n12. **Content-Length**: `Content-Length: 142` - The Content-Length\
  \ header indicates the size of the message body in bytes.\n13. **Message Body**: The message body contains the SDP session\
  \ description, which includes information about the media types, codecs, and transport protocols for the proposed session.\n\
  \n- `v=0` - Protocol version (0 for SDP)\n- `o=jsmith 2890844526 2890842807 IN IP4 pc33.example.com` - Originator and session\
  \ identifier\n- `s=-` - Session name (a single hyphen indicates no session name)\n- `c=IN IP4 pc33.example.com` - Connection\
  \ information (network type, address type, and address)\n- `t=0 0` - Timing information (start and stop times, 0 0 means\
  \ the session is not bounded)\n- `m=audio 49170 RTP/AVP 0` - Media description (media type, port number, transport protocol,\
  \ and format list). In this case, it specifies an audio stream using RTP/AVP (Real-time Transport Protocol / Audio Video\
  \ Profile) and format 0 (PCMU/8000).\n- `a=rtpmap:0 PCMU/8000` - Attribute mapping the format (0) to the codec (PCMU) and\
  \ its clock rate (8000 Hz).\n\n</details>\n\n### SIP REGISTER Example\n\nThe REGISTER method is used in Session Initiation\
  \ Protocol (SIP) to allow a user agent (UA), such as a VoIP phone or a softphone, to **register its location with a SIP\
  \ registrar server**. This process lets the server know **where to route incoming SIP requests destined for the registered\
  \ user**. The registrar server is usually part of a SIP proxy server or a dedicated registration server.\n\nHere's a detailed\
  \ example of the SIP messages involved in a REGISTER authentication process:\n\n1. Initial **REGISTER** request from UA\
  \ to the registrar server:\n\n```yaml\nREGISTER sip:example.com SIP/2.0\nVia: SIP/2.0/UDP 192.168.1.100:5060;branch=z9hG4bK776asdhds\n\
  Max-Forwards: 70\nFrom: Alice <sip:alice@example.com>;tag=565656\nTo: Alice <sip:alice@example.com>\nCall-ID: 1234567890@192.168.1.100\n\
  CSeq: 1 REGISTER\nContact: <sip:alice@192.168.1.100:5060>;expires=3600\nExpires: 3600\nContent-Length: 0\n```\n\nThis initial\
  \ REGISTER message is sent by the UA (Alice) to the registrar server. It includes important information such as the desired\
  \ registration duration (Expires), the user's SIP URI (sip:[alice@example.com](mailto:alice@example.com)), and the user's\
  \ contact address (sip:alice@192.168.1.100:5060).\n\n2. **401 Unauthorized** response from the registrar server:\n\n```\n\
  SIP/2.0 401 Unauthorized\nVia: SIP/2.0/UDP 192.168.1.100:5060;branch=z9hG4bK776asdhds\nFrom: Alice <sip:alice@example.com>;tag=565656\n\
  To: Alice <sip:alice@example.com>;tag=7878744\nCall-ID: 1234567890@192.168.1.100\nCSeq: 1 REGISTER\nWWW-Authenticate: Digest\
  \ realm=\"example.com\", nonce=\"abcdefghijk\", algorithm=MD5, qop=\"auth\"\nContent-Length: 0\n```\n\nThe registrar server\
  \ responds with a \"401 Unauthorized\" message, which includes a \"WWW-Authenticate\" header. This header contains information\
  \ required for the UA to authenticate itself, such as the **authentication realm, nonce, and algorithm**.\n\n3. REGISTER\
  \ request **with authentication credentials**:\n\n```vbnet\nREGISTER sip:example.com SIP/2.0\nVia: SIP/2.0/UDP 192.168.1.100:5060;branch=z9hG4bK776asdhds\n\
  Max-Forwards: 70\nFrom: Alice <sip:alice@example.com>;tag=565656\nTo: Alice <sip:alice@example.com>\nCall-ID: 1234567890@192.168.1.100\n\
  CSeq: 2 REGISTER\nContact: <sip:alice@192.168.1.100:5060>;expires=3600\nExpires: 3600\nAuthorization: Digest username=\"\
  alice\", realm=\"example.com\", nonce=\"abcdefghijk\", uri=\"sip:example.com\", response=\"65a8e2285879283831b664bd8b7f14d4\"\
  , algorithm=MD5, cnonce=\"lmnopqrst\", qop=auth, nc=00000001\nContent-Length: 0\n```\n\nThe UA sends another REGISTER request,\
  \ this time including the **\"Authorization\" header with the necessary credentials, such as the username, realm, nonce,\
  \ and a response value** calculated using the provided information and the user's password.\n\nThis is how the **Authorization\
  \ response** is calculated:\n\n```python\nimport hashlib\n\ndef calculate_sip_md5_response(username, password, realm, method,\
  \ uri, nonce, nc, cnonce, qop):\n    # 1. Calculate HA1 (concatenation of username, realm, and password)\n    ha1_input\
  \ = f\"{username}:{realm}:{password}\"\n    ha1 = hashlib.md5(ha1_input.encode()).hexdigest()\n\n    # 2. Calculate HA2\
  \ (concatenation of method and uri)\n    ha2_input = f\"{method}:{uri}\"\n    ha2 = hashlib.md5(ha2_input.encode()).hexdigest()\n\
  \n    # 3. Calculate the final response value (concatenation of h1, stuff and h2)\n    response_input = f\"{ha1}:{nonce}:{nc}:{cnonce}:{qop}:{ha2}\"\
  \n    response = hashlib.md5(response_input.encode()).hexdigest()\n\n    return response\n\n# Example usage\nusername =\
  \ \"alice\"\npassword = \"mysecretpassword\"\nrealm = \"example.com\"\nmethod = \"REGISTER\"\nuri = \"sip:example.com\"\n\
  nonce = \"abcdefghijk\"\nnc = \"00000001\"\ncnonce = \"lmnopqrst\"\nqop = \"auth\"\n\nresponse = calculate_sip_md5_response(username,\
  \ password, realm, method, uri, nonce, nc, cnonce, qop)\nprint(f\"MD5 response value: {response}\")\n```\n\n4. **Successful\
  \ registration** response from the registrar server:\n\n```yaml\nSIP/2.0 200 OK\nVia: SIP/2.0/UDP 192.168.1.100:5060;branch=z9hG4bK776asdhds\n\
  From: Alice <sip:alice@example.com>;tag=565656\nTo: Alice <sip:alice@example.com>;tag=7878744\nCall-ID: 1234567890@192.168.1.100\n\
  CSeq: 2 REGISTER\nContact: <sip:alice@192.168.1.100:5060>;expires=3600\nExpires: 3600\nContent-Length: 0\n```\n\nAfter the\
  \ registrar server verifies the provided credentials, **it sends a \"200 OK\" response to indicate that the registration\
  \ was successful**. The response includes the registered contact information and the expiration time for the registration.\
  \ At this point, the user agent (Alice) is successfully registered with the SIP registrar server, and incoming SIP requests\
  \ for Alice can be routed to the appropriate contact address.\n\n### Call Example\n\n<figure><img src=\"../../../images/image\
  \ (1101).png\" alt=\"\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n> [!TIP]\n> It's not mentioned, but User B needs to have sent\
  \ a **REGISTER message to Proxy 2** before he is able to receive calls.\n\n\n\n---\n\n## SIP Security and Pentesting Notes\n\
  \nThis section adds practical, protocol-specific tips without duplicating the broader VoIP guidance. For end-to-end VoIP\
  \ attacking methodology, tools and scenarios, see:\n\n{{#ref}}\n../README.md\n{{#endref}}\n\n### Fingerprinting and Discovery\n\
  \n- Send an OPTIONS request and review `Allow`, `Supported`, `Server` and `User-Agent` headers to fingerprint devices and\
  \ stacks:\n  \n  ```bash\n  # nmap NSE (UDP 5060 by default)\n  sudo nmap -sU -p 5060 --script sip-methods <target>\n  \n\
  \  # Minimal raw OPTIONS over UDP\n  printf \"OPTIONS sip:<target> SIP/2.0\\r\\nVia: SIP/2.0/UDP attacker;branch=z9\\r\\\
  nFrom: <sip:probe@attacker>;tag=1\\r\\nTo: <sip:probe@<target>>\\r\\nCall-ID: 1@attacker\\r\\nCSeq: 1 OPTIONS\\r\\nMax-Forwards:\
  \ 70\\r\\nContact: <sip:probe@attacker>\\r\\nContent-Length: 0\\r\\n\\r\\n\" | nc -u -w 2 <target> 5060\n  ```\n\n### Username/Extension\
  \ Enumeration Behavior\n\n- Enumeration typically abuses differences between `401/407` vs `404/403` on `REGISTER`/`INVITE`.\
  \ Harden servers to reply uniformly.\n  - Asterisk chan_sip: set `alwaysauthreject=yes` (general) to avoid disclosing valid\
  \ users. In newer Asterisk (PJSIP), guest calling is disabled unless an `anonymous` endpoint is defined and similar \"always\
  \ auth reject\" behavior is the default; still enforce network ACLs and fail2ban at the perimeter.\n\n### SIP Digest Authentication:\
  \ algorithms and cracking\n\n- SIP commonly uses HTTP-Digest style auth. Historically MD5 (and MD5-sess) are prevalent;\
  \ newer stacks support SHA-256 and SHA-512/256 per RFC 8760. Prefer these stronger algorithms in modern deployments and\
  \ disable MD5 when possible.\n- Offline cracking from a pcap is trivial for MD5 digests. After extracting the challenge/response,\
  \ you can use hashcat mode 11400 (SIP digest, MD5):\n  \n  ```bash\n  # Example hash format (single line)\n  # username:realm:method:uri:nonce:cnonce:nc:qop:response\n\
  \  echo 'alice:example.com:REGISTER:sip:example.com:abcdef:11223344:00000001:auth:65a8e2285879283831b664bd8b7f14d4' > sip.hash\n\
  \  \n  # Crack with a wordlist\n  hashcat -a 0 -m 11400 sip.hash /path/to/wordlist.txt\n  ```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> RFC 8760 defines\
  \ SHA-256 and SHA-512/256 for HTTP Digest (used by SIP). Adoption is uneven; ensure your tools handle these when targeting\
  \ modern PBXs.\n\n### SIP over TLS (SIPS) and over WebSockets\n\n- Signaling encryption:\n  - `sips:` URIs and TCP/TLS typically\
  \ on 5061. Verify certificate validation on endpoints; many accept self-signed or wildcard certs, enabling MitM in weak\
  \ deployments.\n  - WebRTC softphones often use SIP over WebSocket per RFC 7118 (`ws://` or `wss://`). If the PBX exposes\
  \ WSS, test authentication and CORS, and ensure rate limits are enforced on the HTTP front end as well.\n\n### DoS quick\
  \ checks (protocol level)\n\n- Flooding INVITE, REGISTER or malformed messages can exhaust transaction processing.\n- Simple\
  \ rate-limiting example for UDP/5060 (Linux iptables hashlimit):\n  \n  ```bash\n  # Limit new SIP packets from a single\
  \ IP to 20/s with burst 40\n  iptables -A INPUT -p udp --dport 5060 -m hashlimit \\\n    --hashlimit-name SIP --hashlimit\
  \ 20/second --hashlimit-burst 40 \\\n    --hashlimit-mode srcip -j ACCEPT\n  iptables -A INPUT -p udp --dport 5060 -j DROP\n\
  \  ```\n\n### Recent, relevant SIP-stack CVE to watch (Asterisk PJSIP)\n\n- CVE-2024-35190 (published May 17, 2024): In\
  \ specific Asterisk releases, `res_pjsip_endpoint_identifier_ip` could misidentify unauthorized SIP requests as a local\
  \ endpoint, potentially enabling unauthorized actions or information exposure. Fixed in 18.23.1, 20.8.1 and 21.3.1. Validate\
  \ your PBX version when testing and report responsibly.\n\n### Hardening checklist (SIP-specific)\n\n- Prefer TLS for signaling\
  \ and SRTP/DTLS-SRTP for media; disable cleartext where feasible.\n- Enforce strong passwords and digest algorithms (SHA-256/512-256\
  \ where supported; avoid MD5).\n- For Asterisk:\n  - chan_sip: `alwaysauthreject=yes`, `allowguest=no`, per-endpoint `permit`/`deny`\
  \ CIDR ACLs.\n  - PJSIP: do not create an `anonymous` endpoint unless needed; enforce endpoint `acl`/`media_acl`; enable\
  \ fail2ban or equivalent.\n- Topology hiding on SIP proxies (e.g., outbound proxy/edge SBC) to reduce information leakage.\n\
  - Strict `OPTIONS` handling and rate limits; disable unused methods (e.g., `MESSAGE`, `PUBLISH`) if not required.\n\n\n\n\
