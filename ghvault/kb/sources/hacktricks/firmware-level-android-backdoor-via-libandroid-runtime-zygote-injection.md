  \n## Overview\n\nSupply-chain tampering of `/system/lib[64]/libandroid_runtime.so` can hijack `android.util.Log.println_native`\
  \ so that **every app forked from Zygote executes attacker code**. The Keenadu backdoor adds a single call inside `println_native`\
  \ that drives a native dropper. Because all app processes run this code, Android sandbox boundaries and per-app permissions\
  \ are effectively bypassed.\n\nThe same **post-root execution model** also appears in multi-stage Android rootkits delivered\
  \ from apparently benign Play-distributed apps. In McAfee's **Operation NoVoice** analysis, the malware first landed in\
  \ user space, obtained root with device-tailored exploits, and then **replaced `libandroid_runtime.so` and `libmedia_jni.so`\
  \ on the system partition** so that every app spawned by `zygote` inherited the attacker hooks after reboot.\n\n## Pre-root\
  \ staging: SDK init hijack + PNG tail polyglot\n\nBefore the `libandroid_runtime.so` replacement, NoVoice used an app-level\
  \ bootstrap that is worth recognizing during APK triage:\n\n- **Auto-exec on first launch**: bootstrap code ran from a tampered\
  \ Facebook SDK init path, so no extra user interaction or suspicious permission prompt was required.\n- **Payload smuggling\
  \ in assets**: the app shipped a valid **PNG** with an encrypted blob appended **after the PNG `IEND` marker**. Android\
  \ image decoders ignore trailing bytes, but the loader carved the tail into `enc.apk`, decrypted it into `h.apk`, loaded\
  \ it, and deleted the staging files.\n- **Triage clue**: if bytes immediately after `IEND` begin with a magic such as `CAFEBABE`,\
  \ assume the image is acting as a **polyglot carrier** for a Java class / JAR / APK payload rather than as a pure media\
  \ asset.\n\nQuick checks:\n\n```bash\npngcheck -v suspicious.png\ntail -c +1 suspicious.png | xxd | tail\nbinwalk -e suspicious.png\n\
  ```\n\nHunting notes:\n\n- Search APK `assets/` for PNGs with **unexpected trailing bytes** or high entropy after `IEND`.\n\
  - Trace early init paths such as `Application.onCreate`, third-party SDK bootstrap code, or native `JNI_OnLoad` handlers\
  \ that open asset PNGs and then write `*.apk` / `*.jar` files into the app sandbox.\n\n## Dropper path: native patch → RC4\
  \ → DexClassLoader\n- Hooked entry: extra call inside `println_native` to `__log_check_tag_count` (injected static lib `libVndxUtils.a`).\n\
  - Payload storage: RC4-decrypt blob embedded in the `.so`, drop to `/data/dalvik-cache/arm[64]/system@framework@vndx_10x.jar@classes.jar`.\n\
  - Load & execute: `DexClassLoader` loads the jar and invokes `com.ak.test.Main.main`. Runtime logs use tag `AK_CPP` (triage\
  \ artifact).\n- Anti-analysis: aborts in Google/Sprint/T-Mobile system apps or if kill-switch files exist.\n- Zygote role\
  \ split:\n  - In `system_server` → instantiate `AKServer`.\n  - In any other app → instantiate `AKClient`.\n\n## Binder-based\
  \ client/server backdoor\n- `AKServer` (running in `system_server`) sends protected broadcasts:\n  - `com.action.SystemOptimizeService`\
  \ → binder interface for clients.\n  - `com.action.SystemProtectService` → binder interface for downloaded modules.\n- `AKClient`\
  \ (inside every app) receives the interface via broadcast and performs an `attach` transaction, handing an IPC wrapper so\
  \ the server can load arbitrary DEX **inside the current app process**.\n- Exposed privileged operations (via `SystemProtectService`):\
  \ grant/revoke any permission for any package, retrieve geolocation, and exfiltrate device info. This centralizes privilege\
  \ bypass while still executing code in chosen target apps (Chrome, YouTube, launcher, shopping apps, etc.).\n\n## C2 staging,\
  \ crypto, and gating\n- Host discovery: Base64 → gzip → AES-128-CFB decrypt with key `MD5(\"ota.host.ba60d29da7fd4794b5c5f732916f7d5c\"\
  )`, IV `\"0102030405060708\"`.\n- Victim registration: collect IMEI/MAC/model/OS, encrypt with key `MD5(\"ota.api.bbf6e0a947a5f41d7f5226affcfd858c\"\
  )`, POST to `/ak/api/pts/v4` with params `m=MD5(IMEI)` and `n=w|m` (network type). Response `data` is encrypted identically.\n\
  - Activation delay: C2 serves modules only after ~2.5 months from an \"activation time\" in the request, frustrating sandbox\
  \ detonations.\n- Module container (proprietary):\n```\nstruct KeenaduPayload {\n    int32_t  version;\n    uint8_t  padding[0x100];\n\
  \    uint8_t  salt[0x20];\n    KeenaduChunk config;   // size + data\n    KeenaduChunk payload;  // size + data\n    KeenaduChunk\
  \ signature;// size + data\n} __packed;\n```\n  - Integrity: MD5 file check + DSA signature (only operator with private\
  \ key can issue modules).\n  - Decryption: AES-128-CFB, key `MD5(\"37d9a33df833c0d6f11f1b8079aaa2dc\" + salt)`, IV `\"0102030405060708\"\
  `.\n\n## Post-root persistence: wrapper libraries + framework patching + self-heal\n\nOnce root is available, replacing\
  \ `libandroid_runtime.so` is only one layer of persistence. NoVoice shows a more resilient pattern:\n\n- **Wrapper replacement\
  \ instead of inline patching**: the installer backed up the original system library and replaced it with an **architecture-matched\
  \ hook wrapper**. The same campaign also replaced `libmedia_jni.so`, giving multiple code-execution choke points inside\
  \ the framework.\n- **Second-stage persistence in framework bytecode**: after the library swap, a dedicated patcher modified\
  \ **pre-compiled Android framework bytecode on disk**. This means restoring the original `.so` may still leave injected\
  \ redirections active.\n- **Self-healing watchdog**: a daemon checked the installation roughly every 60 seconds, restored\
  \ missing components, and could **force a reboot** if reinsertion kept failing. The malware also replaced the system crash\
  \ handler / recovery flow so rebooting re-launched the rootkit.\n- **Per-app payload assembly at runtime**: after reboot,\
  \ the replaced `libandroid_runtime.so` caused each spawned app to load attacker code. NoVoice stored secondary payloads\
  \ as fragments inside the malicious library, assembled them in memory, and deleted the disk copies immediately after load.\n\
  \nPractical implications:\n\n- **Factory reset is insufficient** when the malware has modified the **system partition**\
  \ or framework artifacts. Reflash the firmware instead.\n- Diff both **`/system/lib*/libandroid_runtime.so`** and **framework\
  \ oat/odex/vdex artifacts**; checking only the shared library can miss the bytecode persistence layer.\n- If a device keeps\
  \ restoring the malicious library after manual cleanup, look for a **watchdog daemon**, modified recovery scripts, or a\
  \ replaced crash-handler path that is re-seeding the implant on boot.\n\n## Persistence & forensic tips\n- Supply chain\
  \ placement: malicious static lib `libVndxUtils.a` linked into `libandroid_runtime.so` during build (e.g., `vendor/mediatek/proprietary/external/libutils/arm[64]/libVndxUtils.a`).\n\
  - Firmware auditing: firmware images ship as Android Sparse `super.img`; use `lpunpack` (or similar) to extract partitions\
  \ and inspect `libandroid_runtime.so` for extra calls in `println_native`.\n- On-device artifacts: presence of `/data/dalvik-cache/arm*/system@framework@vndx_10x.jar@classes.jar`,\
  \ logcat tag `AK_CPP`, or protected broadcasts named `com.action.SystemOptimizeService`/`com.action.SystemProtectService`\
  \ indicate compromise.\n- For Android rootkits deployed from apps instead of factory supply chain, also inspect:\n  - APK\
  \ `assets/` for polyglot PNGs with appended data after `IEND`\n  - Replaced `/system/lib*/libandroid_runtime.so` or `/system/lib*/libmedia_jni.so`\n\
  \  - Modified framework oat/odex/vdex files that preserve hook redirections\n  - Periodic watchdog processes that rewrite\
  \ removed files or trigger forced reboots\n\n## References\n- [Keenadu firmware backdoor analysis](https://securelist.com/keenadu-android-backdoor/118913/)\n\
