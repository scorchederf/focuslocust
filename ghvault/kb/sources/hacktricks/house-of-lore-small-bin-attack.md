_body: "# House of Lore | Small bin Attack\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n## Basic Information\n\n\
  ### Code\n\n- Check the one from [https://ctf-wiki.mahaloz.re/pwn/linux/glibc-heap/house_of_lore/](https://ctf-wiki.mahaloz.re/pwn/linux/glibc-heap/house_of_lore/)\n\
  \  - This isn't working\n- Or: [https://github.com/shellphish/how2heap/blob/master/glibc_2.39/house_of_lore.c](https://github.com/shellphish/how2heap/blob/master/glibc_2.39/house_of_lore.c)\n\
  \  - This isn't working even if it tries to bypass some checks getting the error: `malloc(): unaligned tcache chunk detected`\n\
  - This example is still working: [**https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/40-house_of_lore/house_lore_exp/index.html**](https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/40-house_of_lore/house_lore_exp/index.html)\n\
  \n### Goal\n\n- Insert a **fake small chunk in the small bin so then it's possible to allocate it**.\\\n  Note that the\
  \ small chunk added is the fake one the attacker creates and not a fake one in an arbitrary position.\n\n### Requirements\n\
  \n- Create 2 fake chunks and link them together and with the legit chunk in the small bin:\n  - `fake0.bk` -> `fake1`\n\
  \  - `fake1.fd` -> `fake0`\n  - `fake0.fd` -> `legit` (you need to modify a pointer in the freed small bin chunk via some\
  \ other vuln)\n  - `legit.bk` -> `fake0`\n\nThen you will be able to allocate `fake0`.\n\n### Attack\n\n- A small chunk\
  \ (`legit`) is allocated, then another one is allocated to prevent consolidating with top chunk. Then, `legit` is freed\
  \ (moving it to the unsorted bin list) and the a larger chunk is allocated, **moving `legit` it to the small bin.**\n- An\
  \ attacker generates a couple of fake small chunks, and makes the needed linking to bypass sanity checks:\n  - `fake0.bk`\
  \ -> `fake1`\n  - `fake1.fd` -> `fake0`\n  - `fake0.fd` -> `legit` (you need to modify a pointer in the freed small bin\
  \ chunk via some other vuln)\n  - `legit.bk` -> `fake0`\n- A small chunk is allocated to get legit, making **`fake0`** into\
  \ the top list of small bins\n- Another small chunk is allocated, getting `fake0` as a chunk, allowing potentially to read/write\
  \ pointers inside of it.\n\n## References\n\n- [https://ctf-wiki.mahaloz.re/pwn/linux/glibc-heap/house_of_lore/](https://ctf-wiki.mahaloz.re/pwn/linux/glibc-heap/house_of_lore/)\n\
