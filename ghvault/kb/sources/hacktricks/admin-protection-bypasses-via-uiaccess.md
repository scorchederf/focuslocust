_body: "# Admin Protection Bypasses via UIAccess\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n## Overview\n- Windows\
  \ AppInfo exposes `RAiLaunchAdminProcess` to spawn UIAccess processes (intended for accessibility). UIAccess bypasses most\
  \ User Interface Privilege Isolation (UIPI) message filtering so accessibility software can drive higher-IL UI.\n- Enabling\
  \ UIAccess directly requires `NtSetInformationToken(TokenUIAccess)` with **SeTcbPrivilege**, so low-priv callers rely on\
  \ the service. The service performs three checks on the target binary before setting UIAccess:\n  - Embedded manifest contains\
  \ `uiAccess=\"true\"`.\n  - Signed by any certificate trusted by the Local Machine root store (no EKU/Microsoft requirement).\n\
  \  - Located in an administrator-only path on the system drive (e.g., `C:\\Windows`, `C:\\Windows\\System32`, `C:\\Program\
  \ Files`, excluding specific writable subpaths).\n- `RAiLaunchAdminProcess` performs no consent prompt for UIAccess launches\
  \ (otherwise accessibility tooling could not drive the prompt).\n\n## Token shaping and integrity levels\n- If the checks\
  \ succeed, AppInfo **copies the caller token**, enables UIAccess, and bumps Integrity Level (IL):\n  - Limited admin user\
  \ (user is in Administrators but running filtered) ➜ **High IL**.\n  - Non-admin user ➜ IL increased by **+16 levels** up\
  \ to a **High** cap (System IL is never assigned).\n  - If the caller token already has UIAccess, IL is left unchanged.\n\
  - “Ratchet” trick: a UIAccess process can disable UIAccess on itself, relaunch via `RAiLaunchAdminProcess`, and gain another\
  \ +16 IL increment. Medium➜High takes 255 relaunches (noisy, but works).\n\n## Why UIAccess enables an Admin Protection\
  \ escape\n- UIAccess lets a lower-IL process send window messages to higher-IL windows (bypassing UIPI filters). At **equal\
  \ IL**, classic UI primitives like `SetWindowsHookEx` **do allow code injection/DLL loading** into any process that owns\
  \ a window (including **message-only windows** used by COM). \n- Admin Protection launches the UIAccess process under the\
  \ **limited user’s identity** but at **High IL**, silently. Once arbitrary code runs inside that High-IL UIAccess process,\
  \ the attacker can inject into other High-IL processes on the desktop (even belonging to different users), breaking the\
  \ intended separation.\n\n## HWND-to-process handle primitive (`GetProcessHandleFromHwnd` / `NtUserGetWindowProcessHandle`)\n\
  - On Windows 10 1803+ the API moved into Win32k (`NtUserGetWindowProcessHandle`) and can open a process handle using a caller-supplied\
  \ `DesiredAccess`. The kernel path uses `ObOpenObjectByPointer(..., KernelMode, ...)`, which bypasses normal user-mode access\
  \ checks.\n- Preconditions in practice: the target window must be on the same desktop, and UIPI checks must pass. Historically,\
  \ a caller with UIAccess could bypass UIPI failure and still get a kernel-mode handle (fixed as CVE-2023-41772).\n- Impact:\
  \ a window handle becomes a **capability** to obtain a powerful process handle (commonly `PROCESS_DUP_HANDLE`, `PROCESS_VM_READ`,\
  \ `PROCESS_VM_WRITE`, `PROCESS_VM_OPERATION`) that the caller could not normally open. This enables cross-sandbox access\
  \ and can break Protected Process / PPL boundaries if the target exposes any window (including message-only windows).\n\
  - Practical abuse flow: enumerate or locate HWNDs (e.g., `EnumWindows`/`FindWindowEx`), resolve the owning PID (`GetWindowThreadProcessId`),\
  \ call `GetProcessHandleFromHwnd`, then use the returned handle for memory read/write or code-hijack primitives.\n- Post-fix\
  \ behavior: UIAccess no longer grants kernel-mode opens on UIPI failure and allowed access rights are restricted to the\
  \ legacy hook set; Windows 11 24H2 adds process-protection checks and feature-flagged safer paths. Disabling UIPI system-wide\
  \ (`EnforceUIPI=0`) weakens these protections.\n\n## Secure-directory validation weaknesses (AppInfo `AiCheckSecureApplicationDirectory`)\n\
  AppInfo resolves the supplied path via `GetFinalPathNameByHandle` and then applies **string allow/deny checks** against\
  \ hardcoded roots/exclusions. Multiple bypass classes stem from that simplistic validation:\n- **Directory named streams**:\
  \ Excluded writable directories (e.g., `C:\\Windows\\tracing`) can be bypassed with a named stream on the directory itself,\
  \ e.g. `C:\\Windows\\tracing:file.exe`. The string checks see `C:\\Windows\\` and miss the excluded subpath.\n- **Writable\
  \ file/directory inside an allowed root**: `CreateProcessAsUser` does **not require a `.exe` extension**. Overwriting any\
  \ writable file under an allowed root with an executable payload works, or copying a signed `uiAccess=\"true\"` EXE into\
  \ any writable subdirectory (e.g., update leftovers such as `Tasks_Migrated` when present) lets it pass the secure-path\
  \ check.\n- **MSIX into `C:\\Program Files\\WindowsApps` (fixed)**: Non-admins could install signed MSIX packages that landed\
  \ in `WindowsApps`, which was not excluded. Packaging a UIAccess binary inside the MSIX then launching it via `RAiLaunchAdminProcess`\
  \ yielded a **promptless High-IL UIAccess process**. Microsoft mitigated by excluding this path; the `uiAccess` restricted\
  \ MSIX capability itself already requires admin install.\n\n## Attack workflow (High IL without a prompt)\n1. Obtain/build\
  \ a **signed UIAccess binary** (manifest `uiAccess=\"true\"`).\n2. Place it where AppInfo’s allowlist accepts it (or abuse\
  \ a path-validation edge case/writable artifact as above).\n3. Call `RAiLaunchAdminProcess` to spawn it **silently** with\
  \ UIAccess + elevated IL.\n4. From that High-IL foothold, target another High-IL process on the desktop using **window hooks/DLL\
  \ injection** or other same-IL primitives to fully compromise the admin context.\n\n## Enumerating candidate writable paths\n\
  Run the PowerShell helper to discover writable/overwritable objects inside nominally secure roots from the perspective of\
  \ a chosen token:\n\n```powershell\n$paths = \"C:\\\\Windows\",\"C:\\\\Program Files\",\"C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\"\nGet-AccessibleFile\
  \ -Win32Path $paths -Access Execute,WriteData `\n  -DirectoryAccess AddFile -Recurse -ProcessId <PID>\n```\n\n- Run as Administrator\
  \ for broader visibility; set `-ProcessId` to a low-priv process to mirror that token’s access.\n- Filter manually to exclude\
  \ known disallowed subdirectories before using candidates with `RAiLaunchAdminProcess`.\n\n## Related\n\nSecure Desktop\
