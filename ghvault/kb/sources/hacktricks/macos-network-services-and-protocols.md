  \nThese are the common macOS services to access them remotely.\\\nYou can enable/disable these services in `System Settings`\
  \ --> `Sharing`\n\n- **VNC**, known as “Screen Sharing” (tcp:5900)\n- **SSH**, called “Remote Login” (tcp:22)\n- **Apple\
  \ Remote Desktop** (ARD), or “Remote Management” (tcp:3283, tcp:5900)\n- **AppleEvent**, known as “Remote Apple Event” (tcp:3031)\n\
  \nCheck if any is enabled running:\n\n```bash\nrmMgmt=$(netstat -na | grep LISTEN | grep tcp46 | grep \"*.3283\" | wc -l);\n\
  scrShrng=$(netstat -na | grep LISTEN | egrep 'tcp4|tcp6' | grep \"*.5900\" | wc -l);\nflShrng=$(netstat -na | grep LISTEN\
  \ | egrep 'tcp4|tcp6' | egrep \"\\\\*.88|\\\\*.445|\\\\*.548\" | wc -l);\nrLgn=$(netstat -na | grep LISTEN | egrep 'tcp4|tcp6'\
  \ | grep \"*.22\" | wc -l);\nrAE=$(netstat -na | grep LISTEN | egrep 'tcp4|tcp6' | grep \"*.3031\" | wc -l);\nbmM=$(netstat\
  \ -na | grep LISTEN | egrep 'tcp4|tcp6' | grep \"*.4488\" | wc -l);\nprintf \"\\nThe following services are OFF if '0',\
  \ or ON otherwise:\\nScreen Sharing: %s\\nFile Sharing: %s\\nRemote Login: %s\\nRemote Mgmt: %s\\nRemote Apple Events: %s\\\
  nBack to My Mac: %s\\n\\n\" \"$scrShrng\" \"$flShrng\" \"$rLgn\" \"$rmMgmt\" \"$rAE\" \"$bmM\";\n```\n\n### Enumerating\
  \ sharing configuration locally\n\nWhen you already have local code execution on a Mac, **check the configured state**,\
  \ not just the listening sockets. `systemsetup` and `launchctl` usually tell you whether the service is administratively\
  \ enabled, while `kickstart` and `system_profiler` help confirm the effective ARD/Sharing configuration:\n\n```bash\nsystem_profiler\
  \ SPSharingDataType\nsudo /usr/sbin/systemsetup -getremotelogin\nsudo /usr/sbin/systemsetup -getremoteappleevents\nsudo\
  \ /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/ARDAgent.app/Contents/Resources/kickstart -status\nsudo launchctl print-disabled\
  \ system | egrep 'com.apple.screensharing|com.apple.AEServer|ssh'\n```\n\n### Pentesting ARD\n\nApple Remote Desktop (ARD)\
  \ is an enhanced version of [Virtual Network Computing (VNC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Network_Computing) tailored\
  \ for macOS, offering additional features. A notable vulnerability in ARD is its authentication method for the control screen\
  \ password, which only uses the first 8 characters of the password, making it prone to [brute force attacks](https://thudinh.blogspot.com/2017/09/brute-forcing-passwords-with-thc-hydra.html)\
  \ with tools like Hydra or [GoRedShell](https://github.com/ahhh/GoRedShell/), as there are no default rate limits.\n\nVulnerable\
  \ instances can be identified using **nmap**'s `vnc-info` script. Services supporting `VNC Authentication (2)` are especially\
  \ susceptible to brute force attacks due to the 8-character password truncation.\n\nTo enable ARD for various administrative\
  \ tasks like privilege escalation, GUI access, or user monitoring, use the following command:\n\n```bash\nsudo /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/ARDAgent.app/Contents/Resources/kickstart\
  \ -activate -configure -allowAccessFor -allUsers -privs -all -clientopts -setmenuextra -menuextra yes\n```\n\nARD provides\
  \ versatile control levels, including observation, shared control, and full control, with sessions persisting even after\
  \ user password changes. It allows sending Unix commands directly, executing them as root for administrative users. Task\
  \ scheduling and Remote Spotlight search are notable features, facilitating remote, low-impact searches for sensitive files\
  \ across multiple machines.\n\nFrom an operator perspective, **Monterey 12.1+ changed remote-enablement workflows** in managed\
  \ fleets. If you already control the victim's MDM, Apple's `EnableRemoteDesktop` command is often the cleanest way to activate\
  \ remote desktop functionality on newer systems. If you already have a foothold on the host, `kickstart` is still useful\
  \ to inspect or reconfigure ARD privileges from the command line.\n\n### Pentesting Remote Apple Events (RAE / EPPC)\n\n\
  Apple calls this feature **Remote Application Scripting** in modern System Settings. Under the hood it exposes the **Apple\
  \ Event Manager** remotely over **EPPC** on **TCP/3031** via the `com.apple.AEServer` service. Palo Alto Unit 42 highlighted\
  \ it again as a practical **macOS lateral movement** primitive because valid credentials plus an enabled RAE service allow\
  \ an operator to drive scriptable applications on a remote Mac.\n\nUseful checks:\n\n```bash\nsudo /usr/sbin/systemsetup\
  \ -getremoteappleevents\nsudo launchctl print-disabled system | grep AEServer\nlsof -nP -iTCP:3031 -sTCP:LISTEN\n```\n\n\
  If you already have admin/root on the target and want to enable it:\n\n```bash\nsudo /usr/sbin/systemsetup -setremoteappleevents\
  \ on\n```\n\nBasic connectivity test from another Mac:\n\n```bash\nosascript -e 'tell application \"Finder\" of machine\
  \ \"eppc://user:pass@192.0.2.10\" to get name of startup disk'\n```\n\nIn practice, the abuse case is not limited to Finder.\
  \ Any **scriptable application** that accepts the required Apple events becomes a remote attack surface, which makes RAE\
  \ especially interesting after credential theft on internal macOS networks.\n\n#### Recent Screen-Sharing / ARD vulnerabilities\
  \ (2023-2025)\n\n| Year | CVE | Component | Impact | Fixed in |\n|------|-----|-----------|--------|----------|\n|2023|CVE-2023-42940|Screen\
  \ Sharing|Incorrect session rendering could cause the *wrong* desktop or window to be transmitted, resulting in leakage\
  \ of sensitive information|macOS Sonoma 14.2.1 (Dec 2023) |\n|2024|CVE-2024-44248|Screen Sharing Server|A user with screen\
  \ sharing access may be able to view **another user's screen** because of a state-management issue|macOS Ventura 13.7.2\
  \ / Sonoma 14.7.2 / Sequoia 15.1 (Oct-Dec 2024) |\n\n**Hardening tips**\n\n* Disable *Screen Sharing*/*Remote Management*\
  \ when not strictly required.\n* Keep macOS fully patched (Apple generally ships security fixes for the last three major\
  \ releases).\n* Use a **Strong Password** *and* enforce the *“VNC viewers may control screen with password”* option **disabled**\
  \ when possible.\n* Put the service behind a VPN instead of exposing TCP 5900/3283 to the Internet.\n* Add an Application\
  \ Firewall rule to limit `ARDAgent` to the local subnet:\n\n  ```bash\n  sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw\
  \ --add /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/ARDAgent.app/Contents/MacOS/ARDAgent\n  sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw\
  \ --setblockapp /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/ARDAgent.app/Contents/MacOS/ARDAgent on\n  ```\n\n---\n\n\
  ## Bonjour Protocol\n\nBonjour, an Apple-designed technology, allows **devices on the same network to detect each other's\
  \ offered services**. Known also as Rendezvous, **Zero Configuration**, or Zeroconf, it enables a device to join a TCP/IP\
  \ network, **automatically choose an IP address**, and broadcast its services to other network devices.\n\nZero Configuration\
  \ Networking, provided by Bonjour, ensures that devices can:\n\n- **Automatically obtain an IP Address** even in the absence\
  \ of a DHCP server.\n- Perform **name-to-address translation** without requiring a DNS server.\n- **Discover services**\
  \ available on the network.\n\nDevices using Bonjour will assign themselves an **IP address from the 169.254/16 range**\
  \ and verify its uniqueness on the network. Macs maintain a routing table entry for this subnet, verifiable via `netstat\
  \ -rn | grep 169`.\n\nFor DNS, Bonjour utilizes the **Multicast DNS (mDNS) protocol**. mDNS operates over **port 5353/UDP**,\
  \ employing **standard DNS queries** but targeting the **multicast address 224.0.0.251**. This approach ensures that all\
  \ listening devices on the network can receive and respond to the queries, facilitating the update of their records.\n\n\
  Upon joining the network, each device self-selects a name, typically ending in **.local**, which may be derived from the\
  \ hostname or randomly generated.\n\nService discovery within the network is facilitated by **DNS Service Discovery (DNS-SD)**.\
  \ Leveraging the format of DNS SRV records, DNS-SD uses **DNS PTR records** to enable the listing of multiple services.\
  \ A client seeking a specific service will request a PTR record for `<Service>.<Domain>`, receiving in return a list of\
  \ PTR records formatted as `<Instance>.<Service>.<Domain>` if the service is available from multiple hosts.\n\nThe `dns-sd`\
  \ utility can be employed for **discovering and advertising network services**. Here are some examples of its usage:\n\n\
  ### Searching for SSH Services\n\nTo search for SSH services on the network, the following command is used:\n\n```bash\n\
  dns-sd -B _ssh._tcp\n```\n\nThis command initiates browsing for \\_ssh.\\_tcp services and outputs details such as timestamp,\
  \ flags, interface, domain, service type, and instance name.\n\n### Advertising an HTTP Service\n\nTo advertise an HTTP\
  \ service, you can use:\n\n```bash\ndns-sd -R \"Index\" _http._tcp . 80 path=/index.html\n```\n\nThis command registers\
  \ an HTTP service named \"Index\" on port 80 with a path of `/index.html`.\n\nTo then search for HTTP services on the network:\n\
  \n```bash\ndns-sd -B _http._tcp\n```\n\nWhen a service starts, it announces its availability to all devices on the subnet\
  \ by multicasting its presence. Devices interested in these services don't need to send requests but simply listen for these\
  \ announcements.\n\nFor a more user-friendly interface, the **Discovery - DNS-SD Browser** app available on the Apple App\
  \ Store can visualize the services offered on your local network.\n\nAlternatively, custom scripts can be written to browse\
  \ and discover services using the `python-zeroconf` library. The [**python-zeroconf**](https://github.com/jstasiak/python-zeroconf)\
  \ script demonstrates creating a service browser for `_http._tcp.local.` services, printing added or removed services:\n\
  \n```python\nfrom zeroconf import ServiceBrowser, Zeroconf\n\nclass MyListener:\n\n    def remove_service(self, zeroconf,\
  \ type, name):\n        print(\"Service %s removed\" % (name,))\n\n    def add_service(self, zeroconf, type, name):\n  \
  \      info = zeroconf.get_service_info(type, name)\n        print(\"Service %s added, service info: %s\" % (name, info))\n\
  \nzeroconf = Zeroconf()\nlistener = MyListener()\nbrowser = ServiceBrowser(zeroconf, \"_http._tcp.local.\", listener)\n\
  try:\n    input(\"Press enter to exit...\\n\\n\")\nfinally:\n    zeroconf.close()\n```\n\n### macOS-specific Bonjour hunting\n\
  \nOn macOS networks, Bonjour is frequently the easiest way to find **remote administration surfaces** without touching the\
  \ target directly. Apple Remote Desktop itself can discover clients through Bonjour, so the same discovery data is useful\
  \ to an attacker.\n\n```bash\n# Enumerate every advertised service type first\ndns-sd -B _services._dns-sd._udp local\n\n\
  # Then look for common macOS admin surfaces\ndns-sd -B _rfb._tcp local      # Screen Sharing / VNC\ndns-sd -B _ssh._tcp\
  \ local      # Remote Login\ndns-sd -B _eppc._tcp local     # Remote Apple Events / EPPC\n\n# Resolve a specific instance\
  \ to hostname, port and TXT data\ndns-sd -L \"<Instance>\" _rfb._tcp local\ndns-sd -L \"<Instance>\" _eppc._tcp local\n\
  ```\n\nFor broader **mDNS spoofing, impersonation, and cross-subnet discovery** techniques, check the dedicated page:\n\n\
  {{#ref}}\n../../network-services-pentesting/5353-udp-multicast-dns-mdns.md\n{{#endref}}\n\n### Enumerating Bonjour over\
  \ the network\n\n* **Nmap NSE** – discover services advertised by a single host:\n\n  ```bash\n  nmap -sU -p 5353 --script=dns-service-discovery\
  \ <target>\n  ```\n\n  The `dns-service-discovery` script sends a `_services._dns-sd._udp.local` query and then enumerates\
  \ each advertised service type. \n\n* **mdns_recon** – Python tool that scans entire ranges looking for *misconfigured*\
  \ mDNS responders that answer unicast queries (useful to find devices reachable across subnets/WAN):\n\n  ```bash\n  git\
  \ clone https://github.com/chadillac/mdns_recon && cd mdns_recon\n  python3 mdns_recon.py -r 192.0.2.0/24 -s _ssh._tcp.local\n\
  \  ```\n\n  This will return hosts exposing SSH via Bonjour outside the local link. \n\n### Security considerations & recent\
  \ vulnerabilities (2024-2025)\n\n| Year | CVE | Severity | Issue | Patched in |\n|------|-----|----------|-------|------------|\n\
  |2024|CVE-2024-44183|Medium|A logic error in *mDNSResponder* allowed a crafted packet to trigger a **denial-of-service**|macOS\
  \ Ventura 13.7 / Sonoma 14.7 / Sequoia 15.0 (Sep 2024) |\n|2025|CVE-2025-31222|High|A correctness issue in *mDNSResponder*\
  \ could be abused for **local privilege escalation**|macOS Ventura 13.7.6 / Sonoma 14.7.6 / Sequoia 15.5 (May 2025) |\n\n\
  **Mitigation guidance**\n\n1. Restrict UDP 5353 to *link-local* scope – block or rate-limit it on wireless controllers,\
  \ routers, and host-based firewalls.\n2. Disable Bonjour entirely on systems that do not require service discovery:\n\n\
  \   ```bash\n   sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.mDNSResponder.plist\n   ```\n3. For environments\
  \ where Bonjour is required internally but must never cross network boundaries, use *AirPlay Receiver* profile restrictions\
  \ (MDM) or an mDNS proxy.\n4. Enable **System Integrity Protection (SIP)** and keep macOS up to date – both vulnerabilities\
  \ above were patched quickly but relied on SIP being enabled for full protection.\n\n### Disabling Bonjour\n\nIf there are\
  \ concerns about security or other reasons to disable Bonjour, it can be turned off using the following command:\n\n```bash\n\
  sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.mDNSResponder.plist\n```\n\n## References\n\n- [**The Mac\
