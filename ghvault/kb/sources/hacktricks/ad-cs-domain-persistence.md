_body: "# AD CS Domain Persistence\n\n{{#include ../../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n**This is a summary of the domain\
  \ persistence techniques shared in [https://www.specterops.io/assets/resources/Certified_Pre-Owned.pdf](https://www.specterops.io/assets/resources/Certified_Pre-Owned.pdf)**.\
  \ Check it for further details.\n\n## Forging Certificates with Stolen CA Certificates (Golden Certificate) - DPERSIST1\n\
  \nHow can you tell that a certificate is a CA certificate?\n\nIt can be determined that a certificate is a CA certificate\
  \ if several conditions are met:\n\n- The certificate is stored on the CA server, with its private key secured by the machine's\
  \ DPAPI, or by hardware such as a TPM/HSM if the operating system supports it.\n- Both the Issuer and Subject fields of\
  \ the certificate match the distinguished name of the CA.\n- A \"CA Version\" extension is present in the CA certificates\
  \ exclusively.\n- The certificate lacks Extended Key Usage (EKU) fields.\n\nTo extract the private key of this certificate,\
  \ the `certsrv.msc` tool on the CA server is the supported method via the built-in GUI. Nonetheless, this certificate does\
  \ not differ from others stored within the system; thus, methods such as the [THEFT2 technique](certificate-theft.md#user-certificate-theft-via-dpapi-theft2)\
  \ can be applied for extraction.\n\nThe certificate and private key can also be obtained using Certipy with the following\
  \ command:\n\n```bash\ncertipy ca 'corp.local/administrator@ca.corp.local' -hashes :123123.. -backup\n```\n\nUpon acquiring\
  \ the CA certificate and its private key in `.pfx` format, tools like [ForgeCert](https://github.com/GhostPack/ForgeCert)\
  \ can be utilized to generate valid certificates:\n\n```bash\n# Generating a new certificate with ForgeCert\nForgeCert.exe\
  \ --CaCertPath ca.pfx --CaCertPassword Password123! --Subject \"CN=User\" --SubjectAltName localadmin@theshire.local --NewCertPath\
  \ localadmin.pfx --NewCertPassword Password123!\n\n# Generating a new certificate with certipy\ncertipy forge -ca-pfx CORP-DC-CA.pfx\
  \ -upn administrator@corp.local -subject 'CN=Administrator,CN=Users,DC=CORP,DC=LOCAL'\n\n# Authenticating using the new\
  \ certificate with Rubeus\nRubeus.exe asktgt /user:localdomain /certificate:C:\\ForgeCert\\localadmin.pfx /password:Password123!\n\
  \n# Authenticating using the new certificate with certipy\ncertipy auth -pfx administrator_forged.pfx -dc-ip 172.16.126.128\n\
  ```\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> The user targeted for certificate forgery must be active and capable of authenticating in Active\
  \ Directory for the process to succeed. Forging a certificate for special accounts like krbtgt is ineffective.\n\nThis forged\
  \ certificate will be **valid** until the end date specified and as **long as the root CA certificate is valid** (usually\
  \ from 5 to **10+ years**). It's also valid for **machines**, so combined with **S4U2Self**, an attacker can **maintain\
  \ persistence on any domain machine** for as long as the CA certificate is valid.\\\nMoreover, the **certificates generated**\
  \ with this method **cannot be revoked** as CA is not aware of them.\n\n### Operating under Strong Certificate Mapping Enforcement\
  \ (2025+)\n\nSince February 11, 2025 (after KB5014754 rollout), domain controllers default to **Full Enforcement** for certificate\
  \ mappings. Practically this means your forged certificates must either:\n\n- Contain a strong binding to the target account\
  \ (for example, the SID security extension), or\n- Be paired with a strong, explicit mapping on the target object’s `altSecurityIdentities`\
  \ attribute.\n\nA reliable approach for persistence is to mint a forged certificate chained to the stolen Enterprise CA\
  \ and then add a strong explicit mapping to the victim principal:\n\n```powershell\n# Example: map a forged cert to a target\
  \ account using Issuer+Serial (strong mapping)\n$Issuer  = 'DC=corp,DC=local,CN=CORP-DC-CA'           # reverse DN format\
  \ expected by AD\n$SerialR = '1200000000AC11000000002B'                  # serial in reversed byte order\n$Map     = \"\
  X509:<I>$Issuer<SR>$SerialR\"             # strong mapping format\nSet-ADUser -Identity 'victim' -Add @{altSecurityIdentities=$Map}\n\
  ```\n\nNotes\n- If you can craft forged certificates that include the SID security extension, those will map implicitly\
  \ even under Full Enforcement. Otherwise, prefer explicit strong mappings. See [account-persistence](account-persistence.md)\
  \ for more on explicit mappings.\n- Revocation does not help defenders here: forged certificates are unknown to the CA database\
  \ and thus cannot be revoked.\n\n#### Full-Enforcement compatible forging (SID-aware)\n\nUpdated tooling lets you embed\
  \ the SID directly, keeping golden certificates usable even when DCs reject weak mappings:\n\n```bash\n# Certify 2.0 integrates\
  \ ForgeCert and can embed SID\nCertify.exe forge --ca-pfx CORP-DC-CA.pfx --ca-pass Password123! \\\n  --upn administrator@corp.local\
  \ --sid S-1-5-21-1111111111-2222222222-3333333333-500 \\\n  --outfile administrator_sid.pfx\n\n# Certipy also supports SID\
  \ in forged certs\ncertipy forge -ca-pfx CORP-DC-CA.pfx -upn administrator@corp.local \\\n  -sid S-1-5-21-1111111111-2222222222-3333333333-500\
  \ -out administrator_sid.pfx\n```\n\nBy embedding the SID you avoid having to touch `altSecurityIdentities`, which may be\
  \ monitored, while still satisfying strong mapping checks.\n\n## Trusting Rogue CA Certificates - DPERSIST2\n\nThe `NTAuthCertificates`\
  \ object is defined to contain one or more **CA certificates** within its `cacertificate` attribute, which Active Directory\
  \ (AD) utilizes. The verification process by the **domain controller** involves checking the `NTAuthCertificates` object\
  \ for an entry matching the **CA specified** in the Issuer field of the authenticating **certificate**. Authentication proceeds\
  \ if a match is found.\n\nA self-signed CA certificate can be added to the `NTAuthCertificates` object by an attacker, provided\
  \ they have control over this AD object. Normally, only members of the **Enterprise Admin** group, along with **Domain Admins**\
  \ or **Administrators** in the **forest root’s domain**, are granted permission to modify this object. They can edit the\
  \ `NTAuthCertificates` object using `certutil.exe` with the command `certutil.exe -dspublish -f C:\\Temp\\CERT.crt NTAuthCA`,\
  \ or by employing the [**PKI Health Tool**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/windows-security/import-third-party-ca-to-enterprise-ntauth-store#method-1---import-a-certificate-by-using-the-pki-health-tool).\n\
  \nAdditional helpful commands for this technique:\n\n```bash\n# Add/remove and inspect the Enterprise NTAuth store\ncertutil\
  \ -enterprise -f -AddStore NTAuth C:\\Temp\\CERT.crt\ncertutil -enterprise -viewstore NTAuth\ncertutil -enterprise -delstore\
  \ NTAuth <Thumbprint>\n\n# (Optional) publish into AD CA containers to improve chain building across the forest\ncertutil\
  \ -dspublish -f C:\\Temp\\CERT.crt RootCA          # CN=Certification Authorities\ncertutil -dspublish -f C:\\Temp\\CERT.crt\
  \ CA               # CN=AIA\n```\n\nThis capability is especially relevant when used in conjunction with a previously outlined\
  \ method involving ForgeCert to dynamically generate certificates.\n\n> Post-2025 mapping considerations: placing a rogue\
  \ CA in NTAuth only establishes trust in the issuing CA. To use leaf certificates for logon when DCs are in **Full Enforcement**,\
  \ the leaf must either contain the SID security extension or there must be a strong explicit mapping on the target object\
  \ (for example, Issuer+Serial in `altSecurityIdentities`). See {{#ref}}account-persistence.md{{#endref}}.\n\n## Malicious\
  \ Misconfiguration - DPERSIST3\n\nOpportunities for **persistence** through **security descriptor modifications of AD CS**\
  \ components are plentiful. Modifications described in the \"[Domain Escalation](domain-escalation.md)\" section can be\
  \ maliciously implemented by an attacker with elevated access. This includes the addition of \"control rights\" (e.g., WriteOwner/WriteDACL/etc.)\
  \ to sensitive components such as:\n\n- The **CA server’s AD computer** object\n- The **CA server’s RPC/DCOM server**\n\
  - Any **descendant AD object or container** in **`CN=Public Key Services,CN=Services,CN=Configuration,DC=<DOMAIN>,DC=<COM>`**\
  \ (for instance, the Certificate Templates container, Certification Authorities container, the NTAuthCertificates object,\
  \ etc.)\n- **AD groups delegated rights to control AD CS** by default or by the organization (such as the built-in Cert\
  \ Publishers group and any of its members)\n\nAn example of malicious implementation would involve an attacker, who has\
  \ **elevated permissions** in the domain, adding the **`WriteOwner`** permission to the default **`User`** certificate template,\
  \ with the attacker being the principal for the right. To exploit this, the attacker would first change the ownership of\
  \ the **`User`** template to themselves. Following this, the **`mspki-certificate-name-flag`** would be set to **1** on\
  \ the template to enable **`ENROLLEE_SUPPLIES_SUBJECT`**, allowing a user to provide a Subject Alternative Name in the request.\
  \ Subsequently, the attacker could **enroll** using the **template**, choosing a **domain administrator** name as an alternative\
  \ name, and utilize the acquired certificate for authentication as the DA.\n\nPractical knobs attackers may set for long-term\
  \ domain persistence (see {{#ref}}domain-escalation.md{{#endref}} for full details and detection):\n\n- CA policy flags\
  \ that allow SAN from requesters (e.g., enabling `EDITF_ATTRIBUTESUBJECTALTNAME2`). This keeps ESC1-like paths exploitable.\n\
  - Template DACL or settings that allow authentication-capable issuance (e.g., adding Client Authentication EKU, enabling\
  \ `CT_FLAG_ENROLLEE_SUPPLIES_SUBJECT`).\n- Controlling the `NTAuthCertificates` object or the CA containers to continuously\
  \ re-introduce rogue issuers if defenders attempt cleanup.\n\n> [!TIP]\n> In hardened environments after KB5014754, pairing\
  \ these misconfigurations with explicit strong mappings (`altSecurityIdentities`) ensures your issued or forged certificates\
  \ remain usable even when DCs enforce strong mapping.\n\n### Certificate renewal abuse (ESC14) for persistence\n\nIf you\
  \ compromise an authentication-capable certificate (or an Enrollment Agent one), you can **renew it indefinitely** as long\
  \ as the issuing template remains published and your CA still trusts the issuer chain. Renewal keeps the original identity\
  \ bindings but extends validity, making eviction difficult unless the template is fixed or the CA is republished.\n\n```bash\n\
  # Renew a stolen user cert to extend validity\ncertipy req -ca CORP-DC-CA -template User -pfx stolen_user.pfx -renew -out\
  \ user_renewed_2026.pfx\n\n# Renew an on-behalf-of cert issued via an Enrollment Agent\ncertipy req -ca CORP-DC-CA -on-behalf-of\
  \ 'CORP/victim' -pfx agent.pfx -renew -out victim_renewed.pfx\n```\n\nIf domain controllers are in **Full Enforcement**,\
  \ add `-sid <victim SID>` (or use a template that still includes the SID security extension) so the renewed leaf certificate\
  \ continues to map strongly without touching `altSecurityIdentities`. Attackers with CA admin rights may also tweak `policy\\\
  RenewalValidityPeriodUnits` to lengthen renewed lifetimes before issuing themselves a cert.\n\n\n## References\n\n- [Microsoft\
