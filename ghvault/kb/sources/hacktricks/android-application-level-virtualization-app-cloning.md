_body: "# Android Application-Level Virtualization (App Cloning)\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n\
  Application-level virtualization (aka app cloning/container frameworks such as DroidPlugin-class loaders) runs multiple\
  \ APKs inside a single host app that controls lifecycle, class loading, storage, and permissions. Guests often execute inside\
  \ the host UID, collapsing Android’s normal per-app isolation and making detection difficult because the system sees one\
  \ process/UID.\n\n## Baseline install/launch vs virtualized execution\n\n- **Normal install**: Package Manager extracts\
  \ APK → `/data/app/<rand>/com.pkg-<rand>/base.apk`, assigns a **unique UID**, and Zygote forks a process that loads `classes.dex`.\n\
  - **Dex load primitive**: `DexFile.openDexFile()` delegates to `openDexFileNative()` using absolute paths; virtualization\
  \ layers commonly hook/redirect this to load guest dex from host-controlled paths.\n- **Virtualized launch**: Host starts\
  \ a process under **its UID**, loads the guest’s `base.apk`/dex with a custom loader, and exposes lifecycle callbacks via\
  \ Java proxies. Guest storage API calls are remapped to host-controlled paths.\n\n## Abuse patterns\n\n- **Permission escalation\
  \ via shared UID**: Guests run under the host UID and can inherit **all host-granted permissions** even if not declared\
  \ in the guest manifest. Over-permissioned hosts (massive `AndroidManifest.xml`) become “permission umbrellas”.\n- **Stealthy\
  \ code loading**: Host hooks `openDexFileNative`/class loaders to inject, replace, or instrument guest dex at runtime, bypassing\
  \ static analysis.\n- **Malicious host vs malicious guest**:\n  - *Evil host*: acts as dropper/executor, instruments/filters\
  \ guest behavior, tampers with crashes.\n  - *Evil guest*: abuses shared UID to reach other guests’ data, ptrace them, or\
  \ leverage host permissions.\n\n## Fingerprinting & detection\n\n- **Multiple base.apk in one process**: A container often\
  \ maps several APKs in the same PID.\n  ```bash\n  adb shell \"cat /proc/<pid>/maps | grep base.apk\"\n  # Suspicious: host\
  \ base.apk + unrelated packages mapped together\n  ```\n- **Hooking/instrumentation artifacts**: Search for known libs (e.g.,\
  \ Frida) in maps and confirm on disk.\n  ```bash\n  adb shell \"cat /proc/<pid>/maps | grep frida\"\n  adb shell \"file\
  \ /data/app/..../lib/arm64/libfrida-gadget.so\"\n  ```\n- **Crash-tamper probe**: Intentionally trigger an exception (e.g.,\
  \ NPE) and observe whether the process dies normally; hosts that intercept lifecycle/crash paths may swallow or rewrite\
  \ crashes.\n\n## Hardening notes\n\n- **Server-side attestation**: Enforce sensitive operations behind [Play Integrity](play-integrity-attestation-bypass.md)\
  \ tokens so only genuine installs (not dynamically loaded guests) are accepted server-side.\n- **Use stronger isolation**:\
  \ For highly sensitive code, prefer **Android Virtualization Framework (AVF)**/TEE-backed execution instead of app-level\
  \ containers that share a UID.\n\n## References\n\n- [Android Application-Level Virtualization (App Cloning) — How It Works,\
