  \ Language (SAML)** enables identity providers (IdP) to be utilized for sending authorization credentials to service providers\
  \ (SP), facilitating single sign-on (SSO). This approach simplifies the management of multiple logins by allowing a single\
  \ set of credentials to be used across multiple websites. It leverages XML for standardized communication between IdPs and\
  \ SPs, linking the authentication of user identity with service authorization.\n\n### Comparison between SAML and OAuth\n\
  \n- **SAML** is tailored towards providing enterprises with greater control over SSO login security.\n- **OAuth** is designed\
  \ to be more mobile-friendly, uses JSON, and is a collaborative effort from companies like Google and Twitter.\n\n## SAML\
  \ Authentication Flow\n\n**For further details check the full post from [https://epi052.gitlab.io/notes-to-self/blog/2019-03-07-how-to-test-saml-a-methodology/](https://epi052.gitlab.io/notes-to-self/blog/2019-03-07-how-to-test-saml-a-methodology/)**.\
  \ This is a summary:\n\nThe SAML authentication process involves several steps, as illustrated in the schema:\n\n![https://epi052.gitlab.io/notes-to-self/img/saml/saml-flow.jpg](https://epi052.gitlab.io/notes-to-self/img/saml/saml-flow.jpg)\n\
  \n1. **Resource Access Attempt**: The user tries to access a protected resource.\n2. **SAML Request Generation**: The SP\
  \ does not recognize the user and generates a SAML Request.\n3. **Redirect to IdP**: The user is redirected to the IdP,\
  \ with the SAML Request passing through the user's browser.\n4. **IdP Receives Request**: The IdP receives the SAML Request.\n\
  5. **Authentication at IdP**: The IdP authenticates the user.\n6. **User Validation**: The IdP validates the user's legitimacy\
  \ to access the requested resource.\n7. **SAML Response Creation**: The IdP generates a SAML Response containing necessary\
  \ assertions.\n8. **Redirect to SP's ACS URL**: The user is redirected to the SP's Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL.\n\
  9. **SAML Response Validation**: The ACS validates the SAML Response.\n10. **Resource Access Granted**: Access to the initially\
  \ requested resource is granted.\n\n## SAML Request Example\n\nConsider the scenario where a user requests access to a secure\
  \ resource at [https://shibdemo-sp1.test.edu/secure/](https://shibdemo-sp1.test.edu/secure/). The SP identifies the lack\
  \ of authentication and generates a SAML Request:\n\n```\nGET /secure/ HTTP/1.1\nHost: shibdemo-sp1.test.edu\n...\n```\n\
  \nThe raw SAML Request looks like this:\n\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<samlp:AuthnRequest ...\n</samlp:AuthnRequest>\n\
  ```\n\nKey elements of this request include:\n\n- **AssertionConsumerServiceURL**: Specifies where the IdP should send the\
  \ SAML Response post-authentication.\n- **Destination**: The IdP's address to which the request is sent.\n- **ProtocolBinding**:\
  \ Defines the transmission method of SAML protocol messages.\n- **saml:Issuer**: Identifies the entity that initiated the\
  \ request.\n\nFollowing the SAML Request generation, the SP responds with a **302 redirect**, directing the browser to the\
  \ IdP with the SAML Request encoded in the HTTP response's **Location** header. The **RelayState** parameter maintains the\
  \ state information throughout the transaction, ensuring the SP recognizes the initial resource request upon receiving the\
  \ SAML Response. The **SAMLRequest** parameter is a compressed and encoded version of the raw XML snippet, utilizing Deflate\
  \ compression and base64 encoding.\n\n## SAML Response Example\n\nYou can find a [full SAML response here](https://epi052.gitlab.io/notes-to-self/blog/2019-03-07-how-to-test-saml-a-methodology/).\
  \ The key components of the response include:\n\n- **ds:Signature**: This section, an XML Signature, ensures the integrity\
  \ and authenticity of the issuer of the assertion. The SAML response in the example contains two `ds:Signature` elements,\
  \ one for the message and the other for the assertion.\n- **saml:Assertion**: This part holds information about the user's\
  \ identity and possibly other attributes.\n- **saml:Subject**: It specifies the principal subject of all the statements\
  \ in the assertion.\n- **saml:StatusCode**: Represents the status of the operation in response to the corresponding request.\n\
  - **saml:Conditions**: Details conditions like the validity timing of the Assertion and the specified Service Provider.\n\
  - **saml:AuthnStatement**: Confirms that the IdP authenticated the subject of the Assertion.\n- **saml:AttributeStatement**:\
  \ Contains attributes describing the subject of the Assertion.\n\nFollowing the SAML Response, the process includes a 302\
  \ redirect from the IdP. This leads to a POST request to the Service Provider's Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL. The\
  \ POST request includes `RelayState` and `SAMLResponse` parameters. The ACS is responsible for processing and validating\
  \ the SAML Response.\n\nAfter the POST request is received and the SAML Response is validated, access is granted to the\
  \ protected resource initially requested by the user. This is illustrated with a `GET` request to the `/secure/` endpoint\
  \ and a `200 OK` response, indicating successful access to the resource.\n\n## XML Signatures\n\nXML Signatures are versatile,\
  \ capable of signing an entire XML tree or specific elements within it. They can be applied to any XML Object, not just\
  \ Response elements. Below are the key types of XML Signatures:\n\n### Basic Structure of XML Signature\n\nAn XML Signature\
  \ consists of essential elements as shown:\n\n```xml\n<Signature>\n  <SignedInfo>\n    <CanonicalizationMethod />\n    <SignatureMethod\
  \ />\n    <Reference>\n       <Transforms />\n       <DigestMethod />\n       <DigestValue />\n    </Reference>\n    ...\n\
  \  </SignedInfo>\n  <SignatureValue />\n  <KeyInfo />\n  <Object />\n</Signature>\n```\n\nEach `Reference` element signifies\
  \ a specific resource being signed, identifiable by the URI attribute.\n\n### Types of XML Signatures\n\n1. **Enveloped\
  \ Signature**: This type of signature is a descendant of the resource it signs, meaning the signature is contained within\
  \ the same XML structure as the signed content.\n\n   Example:\n\n   ```xml\n   <samlp:Response ... ID=\"...\" ... >\n \
  \      ...\n       <ds:Signature>\n           <ds:SignedInfo>\n               ...\n               <ds:Reference URI=\"#...\"\
  >\n                   ...\n               </ds:Reference>\n           </ds:SignedInfo>\n       </ds:Signature>\n       ...\n\
  \   </samlp:Response>\n   ```\n\n   In an enveloped signature, the `ds:Transform` element specifies that it's enveloped\
  \ through the `enveloped-signature` algorithm.\n\n2. **Enveloping Signature**: Contrasting with enveloped signatures, enveloping\
  \ signatures wrap the resource being signed.\n\n   Example:\n\n   ```xml\n   <ds:Signature>\n       <ds:SignedInfo>\n  \
  \         ...\n           <ds:Reference URI=\"#...\">\n               ...\n           </ds:Reference>\n       </ds:SignedInfo>\n\
  \       <samlp:Response ... ID=\"...\" ... >\n           ...\n       </samlp:Response>\n   </ds:Signature>\n   ```\n\n3.\
  \ **Detached Signature**: This type is separate from the content it signs. The signature and the content exist independently,\
  \ but a link between the two is maintained.\n\n   Example:\n\n   ```xml\n   <samlp:Response ... ID=\"...\" ... >\n     \
  \  ...\n   </samlp:Response>\n   <ds:Signature>\n       <ds:SignedInfo>\n           ...\n           <ds:Reference URI=\"\
  #...\">\n               ...\n           </ds:Reference>\n       </ds:SignedInfo>\n   </ds:Signature>\n   ```\n\nIn conclusion,\
  \ XML Signatures provide flexible ways to secure XML documents, with each type serving different structural and security\
  \ needs.\n\n## References\n\n- [https://epi052.gitlab.io/notes-to-self/blog/2019-03-07-how-to-test-saml-a-methodology/](https://epi052.gitlab.io/notes-to-self/blog/2019-03-07-how-to-test-saml-a-methodology/)\n\
