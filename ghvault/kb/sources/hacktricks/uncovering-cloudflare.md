  \n- You can use some service that gives you the **historical DNS records** of the domain. Maybe the web page is running\
  \ on an IP address used before.\n  - Same could be achieve **checking historical SSL certificates** that could be pointing\
  \ to the origin IP address.\n  - Check also **DNS records of other subdomains pointing directly to IPs**, as it's possible\
  \ that other subdomains are pointing to the same server (maybe to offer FTP, mail or any other service).\n- If you find\
  \ a **SSRF inside the web application** you can abuse it to obtain the IP address of the server.\n- Search a unique string\
  \ of the web page in browsers such as shodan (and maybe google and similar?). Maybe you can find an IP address with that\
  \ content.\n  - In a similar way instead of looking for a uniq string you could search for the favicon icon with the tool:\
  \ [https://github.com/karma9874/CloudFlare-IP](https://github.com/karma9874/CloudFlare-IP) or with [https://github.com/pielco11/fav-up](https://github.com/pielco11/fav-up)\n\
  \  - This won't work be very frequently because the server must send the same response when it's accessed by the IP address,\
  \ but you never know.\n\n## Tools to uncover Cloudflare\n\n- Search for the domain inside [http://www.crimeflare.org:82/cfs.html](http://www.crimeflare.org:82/cfs.html)\
  \ or [https://crimeflare.herokuapp.com](https://crimeflare.herokuapp.com). Or use the tool [CloudPeler](https://github.com/zidansec/CloudPeler)\
  \ (which uses that API)\n- Search for the domain in [https://leaked.site/index.php?resolver/cloudflare.0/](https://leaked.site/index.php?resolver/cloudflare.0/)\n\
  - [**CF-Hero**](https://github.com/musana/CF-Hero) is a comprehensive reconnaissance tool developed to discover the real\
  \ IP addresses of web applications protected by Cloudflare. It performs multi-source intelligence gathering through various\
  \ methods.\n- [**CloudFlair**](https://github.com/christophetd/CloudFlair) is a tool that will search using Censys certificates\
  \ that contains the domain name, then it will search for IPv4s inside those certificates and finally it will try to access\
  \ the web page in those IPs.\n- [**CloakQuest3r**](https://github.com/spyboy-productions/CloakQuest3r): CloakQuest3r is\
  \ a powerful Python tool meticulously crafted to uncover the true IP address of websites safeguarded by Cloudflare and other\
  \ alternatives, a widely adopted web security and performance enhancement service. Its core mission is to accurately discern\
  \ the actual IP address of web servers that are concealed behind Cloudflare's protective shield.\n- [Censys](https://search.censys.io/)\n\
  - [Shodan](https://shodan.io/)\n- [Bypass-firewalls-by-DNS-history](https://github.com/vincentcox/bypass-firewalls-by-DNS-history)\n\
  - If you have a set of potential IPs where the web page is located you could use [https://github.com/hakluke/hakoriginfinder](https://github.com/hakluke/hakoriginfinder)\n\
  \n```bash\n# You can check if the tool is working with\nprips 1.0.0.0/30 | hakoriginfinder -h one.one.one.one\n\n# If you\
  \ know the company is using AWS you could use the previous tool to search the\n## web page inside the EC2 IPs\nDOMAIN=something.com\n\
  WIDE_REGION=us\nfor ir in `curl https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json | jq -r '.prefixes[] | select(.service==\"\
  EC2\") | select(.region|test(\"^us\")) | .ip_prefix'`; do\n    echo \"Checking $ir\"\n    prips $ir | hakoriginfinder -h\
  \ \"$DOMAIN\"\ndone\n```\n\n## Uncovering Cloudflare from Cloud infrastructure\n\nNote that even if this was done for AWS\
  \ machines, it could be done for any other cloud provider.\n\nFor a better description of this process check:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\n\
  https://trickest.com/blog/cloudflare-bypass-discover-ip-addresses-aws/?utm_campaign=hacktrics&utm_medium=banner&utm_source=hacktricks\n\
  {{#endref}}\n\n```bash\n# Find open ports\nsudo masscan --max-rate 10000 -p80,443 $(curl -s https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json\
  \ | jq -r '.prefixes[] | select(.service==\"EC2\") | .ip_prefix' | tr '\\n' ' ') | grep \"open\"  > all_open.txt\n# Format\
  \ results\ncat all_open.txt | sed 's,.*port \\(.*\\)/tcp on \\(.*\\),\\2:\\1,' | tr -d \" \" > all_open_formated.txt\n#\
  \ Search actual web pages\nhttpx -silent -threads 200 -l all_open_formated.txt -random-agent -follow-redirects -json -no-color\
  \ -o webs.json\n# Format web results and remove eternal redirects\ncat webs.json | jq -r \"select((.failed==false) and (.chain_status_codes\
  \ | length) < 9) | .url\" | sort -u > aws_webs.json\n\n# Search via Host header\nhttpx -json -no-color -list aws_webs.json\
  \ -header Host: cloudflare.malwareworld.com -threads 250 -random-agent -follow-redirects -o web_checks.json\n```\n\n## Bypassing\
  \ Cloudflare through Cloudflare\n\n### Authenticated Origin Pulls\n\nThis mechanism relies on **client** [**SSL certificates**](https://socradar.io/how-to-monitor-your-ssl-certificates-expiration-easily-and-why/)\
  \ **to authenticate connections** between **Cloudflare’s reverse-proxy** servers and the **origin** server, which is called\
  \ **mTLS**.\n\nInstead of configuring it's own certificate, customers can simple use Cloudflare’s certificate to allow any\
  \ connection from Cloudflare, **regardless of the tenant**.\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n> Therefore, an attacker could just set a **domain\
  \ in Cloudflare using Cloudflare's certificate and point** it to the **victim** domain **IP** address. This way, setting\
  \ his domain completely unprotected, Cloudflare won't protect the requests sent.\n\nMore info [**here**](https://socradar.io/cloudflare-protection-bypass-vulnerability-on-threat-actors-radar/).\n\
  \n### Allowlist Cloudflare IP Addresses\n\nThis will **reject connections that do not originate from Cloudflare’s** IP address\
  \ ranges. This is also vulnerable to the previous setup where an attacker just **point his own domain in Cloudflare** to\
  \ the **victims IP** address and attack it.\n\nMore info [**here**](https://socradar.io/cloudflare-protection-bypass-vulnerability-on-threat-actors-radar/).\n\
  \n## Bypass Cloudflare for scraping\n\n### Cache\n\nSometimes you just want to bypass Cloudflare to only scrape the web\
  \ page. There are some options for this:\n\n- Use Google cache: `https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:https://www.petsathome.com/shop/en/pets/dog`\n\
  - Use other cache services such as [https://archive.org/web/](https://archive.org/web/)\n\n### Tools\n\nSome tools like\
  \ the following ones can bypass (or were able to bypass) Cloudflare's protection against scraping:\n\n- [https://github.com/sarperavci/CloudflareBypassForScraping](https://github.com/sarperavci/CloudflareBypassForScraping)\n\
  \n### Cloudflare Solvers\n\nThere have been a number of Cloudflare solvers developed:\n\n- [FlareSolverr](https://github.com/FlareSolverr/FlareSolverr)\n\
  - [cloudscraper](https://github.com/VeNoMouS/cloudscraper) [Guide here](https://scrapeops.io/python-web-scraping-playbook/python-cloudscraper/)\n\
  - [cloudflare-scrape](https://github.com/Anorov/cloudflare-scrape)\n- [CloudflareSolverRe](https://github.com/RyuzakiH/CloudflareSolverRe)\n\
  - [Cloudflare-IUAM-Solver](https://github.com/ninja-beans/cloudflare-iuam-solver)\n- [cloudflare-bypass](https://github.com/devgianlu/cloudflare-bypass)\
  \ \\[Archived]\n- [CloudflareSolverRe](https://github.com/RyuzakiH/CloudflareSolverRe)\n\n### Fortified Headless Browsers\
  \ <a href=\"#option-4-scrape-with-fortified-headless-browsers\" id=\"option-4-scrape-with-fortified-headless-browsers\"\
  ></a>\n\nUse a headless browser that isn't detected as an automated browser (you might need to customize it for that). Some\
  \ options are:\n\n- **Puppeteer:** The [stealth plugin](https://github.com/berstend/puppeteer-extra/tree/master/packages/puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth)\
  \ for [puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer).\n- **Playwright:** The [stealth plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/playwright-stealth)\
  \ is coming to Playwright soon. Follow developments [here](https://github.com/berstend/puppeteer-extra/issues/454) and [here](https://github.com/berstend/puppeteer-extra/tree/master/packages/playwright-extra).\n\
  - **Selenium:** [SeleniumBase](https://github.com/seleniumbase/SeleniumBase) is a modern browser automation framework featuring\
  \ built-in stealth capabilities. It offers two modes: **UC Mode**, an optimized Selenium ChromeDriver patch based on [undetected-chromedriver](https://github.com/ultrafunkamsterdam/undetected-chromedriver),\
  \ and **CDP Mode**, which can bypass bot detection, solve CAPTCHAs, and leverage advanced methods from the Chrome DevTools\
  \ Protocol.\n  \n### Smart Proxy With Cloudflare Built-In Bypass <a href=\"#option-5-smart-proxy-with-cloudflare-built-in-bypass\"\
  \ id=\"option-5-smart-proxy-with-cloudflare-built-in-bypass\"></a>\n\n**Smart proxies** proxies are continuously updated\
  \ by specialized companies, aiming to outmaneuver Cloudflare's security measures (as thats their business).\n\nSom of them\
  \ are:\n\n- [ScraperAPI](https://www.scraperapi.com/?fp_ref=scrapeops)\n- [Scrapingbee](https://www.scrapingbee.com/?fpr=scrapeops)\n\
  - [Oxylabs](https://oxylabs.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=7&aff_id=379&url_id=32)\n- [Smartproxy](https://prf.hn/click/camref:1100loxdG/[p_id:1100l442001]/destination:https%3A%2F%2Fsmartproxy.com%2Fscraping%2Fweb)\
  \ are noted for their proprietary Cloudflare bypass mechanisms.\n\nFor those seeking an optimized solution, the [ScrapeOps\
  \ Proxy Aggregator](https://scrapeops.io/proxy-aggregator/) stands out. This service integrates over 20 proxy providers\
  \ into a single API, automatically selecting the best and most cost-effective proxy for your target domains, thus offering\
  \ a superior option for navigating Cloudflare's defenses.\n\n### Reverse Engineer Cloudflare Anti-Bot Protection <a href=\"\
  #option-6-reverse-engineer-cloudflare-anti-bot-protection\" id=\"option-6-reverse-engineer-cloudflare-anti-bot-protection\"\
  ></a>\n\nReverse engineering Cloudflare's anti-bot measures is a tactic used by smart proxy providers, suitable for extensive\
  \ web scraping without the high cost of running many headless browsers.\n\n**Advantages:** This method allows for the creation\
  \ of an extremely efficient bypass that specifically targets Cloudflare's checks, ideal for large-scale operations.\n\n\
  **Disadvantages:** The downside is the complexity involved in understanding and deceiving Cloudflare's deliberately obscure\
  \ anti-bot system, requiring ongoing effort to test different strategies and update the bypass as Cloudflare enhances its\
  \ protections.\n\nFind more info about how to do this in the [original article](https://scrapeops.io/web-scraping-playbook/how-to-bypass-cloudflare/).\n\
