  ></a>\n\nFlipper Zero can **receive and transmit radio frequencies in the range of 300-928 MHz** with its built-in module,\
  \ which can read, save, and emulate remote controls. These controls are used for interaction with gates, barriers, radio\
  \ locks, remote control switches, wireless doorbells, smart lights, and more. Flipper Zero can help you to learn if your\
  \ security is compromised.\n\n<figure><img src=\"../../../images/image (714).png\" alt=\"\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\
  \n## Sub-GHz hardware <a href=\"#kfpn7\" id=\"kfpn7\"></a>\n\nFlipper Zero has a built-in sub-1 GHz module based on a [\uFEFF\
  ](https://www.st.com/en/nfc/st25r3916.html#overview)\uFEFF[CC1101 chip](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/cc1101.pdf) and\
  \ a radio antenna (the maximum range is 50 meters). Both the CC1101 chip and the antenna are designed to operate at frequencies\
  \ in the 300-348 MHz, 387-464 MHz, and 779-928 MHz bands.\n\n<figure><img src=\"../../../images/image (923).png\" alt=\"\
  \"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n## Actions\n\n### Frequency Analyser\n\n> [!TIP]\n> How to find which frequency\
  \ is the remote using\n\nWhen analysing, Flipper Zero is scanning signals strength (RSSI) at all the frequencies available\
  \ in frequency configuration. Flipper Zero displays the frequency with the highest RSSI value, with signal strength higher\
  \ than -90 [dBm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBm).\n\nTo determine the remote's frequency, do the following:\n\n1. Place\
  \ the remote control very close to the left of Flipper Zero.\n2. Go to **Main Menu** **→ Sub-GHz**.\n3. Select **Frequency\
  \ Analyzer**, then press and hold the button on the remote control you want to analyze.\n4. Review the frequency value on\
  \ the screen.\n\n### Read\n\n> [!TIP]\n> Find info about the frequency used (also another way to find which frequency is\
  \ used)\n\nThe **Read** option **listens on the configured frequency** on the indicated modulation: 433.92 AM by default.\
  \ If **something is found** when reading, **info is given** in the screen. This info could be use to replicate the signal\
  \ in the future.\n\nWhile Read is in use, it's possible to press the **left button** and **configure it**.\\\nAt this moment\
  \ it has **4 modulations** (AM270, AM650, FM328 and FM476), and **several relevant frequencies** stored:\n\n<figure><img\
  \ src=\"../../../images/image (947).png\" alt=\"\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\nYou can set **any that interests\
  \ you**, however, if you are **not sure which frequency** could be the one used by the remote you have, **set Hopping to\
  \ ON** (Off by default), and press the button several times until Flipper captures it and give you the info you need to\
  \ set the frequency.\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n> Switching between frequencies takes some time, therefore signals transmitted at\
  \ the time of switching can be missed. For better signal reception, set a fixed frequency determined by Frequency Analyzer.\n\
  \n### **Read Raw**\n\n> [!TIP]\n> Steal (and replay) a signal in the configured frequency\n\nThe **Read Raw** option **records\
  \ signals** send in the listening frequency. This can be used to **steal** a signal and **repeat** it.\n\nBy default **Read\
  \ Raw is also in 433.92 in AM650**, but if with the Read option you found that the signal that interest you is in a **different\
  \ frequency/modulation, you can also modify that** pressing left (while inside the Read Raw option).\n\n### Brute-Force\n\
  \nIf you know the protocol used for example by the garage door it's possible to g**enerate all the codes and send them with\
  \ the Flipper Zero.** This is an example that support general common types of garages: [**https://github.com/tobiabocchi/flipperzero-bruteforce**](https://github.com/tobiabocchi/flipperzero-bruteforce)\n\
  \n### Add Manually\n\n> [!TIP]\n> Add signals from a configured list of protocols\n\n#### List of [supported protocols](https://docs.flipperzero.one/sub-ghz/add-new-remote)\
