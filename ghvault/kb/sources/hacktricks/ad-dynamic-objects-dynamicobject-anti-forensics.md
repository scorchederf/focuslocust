_body: "# AD Dynamic Objects (dynamicObject) Anti-Forensics\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n## Mechanics\
  \ & Detection Basics\n\n- Any object created with the auxiliary class **`dynamicObject`** gains **`entryTTL`** (seconds\
  \ countdown) and **`msDS-Entry-Time-To-Die`** (absolute expiry). When `entryTTL` reaches 0 the **Garbage Collector deletes\
  \ it without tombstone/recycle-bin**, erasing creator/timestamps and blocking recovery.\n- TTL can be refreshed by updating\
  \ `entryTTL`; min/default are enforced in **Configuration\\Services\\NTDS Settings → `msDS-Other-Settings` → `DynamicObjectMinTTL`\
  \ / `DynamicObjectDefaultTTL`** (supports 1s–1y but commonly defaults to 86,400s/24h). Dynamic objects are **unsupported\
  \ in Configuration/Schema partitions**.\n- Deletion can lag a few minutes on DCs with short uptime (<24h), leaving a narrow\
  \ response window to query/backup attributes. Detect by **alerting on new objects carrying `entryTTL`/`msDS-Entry-Time-To-Die`**\
  \ and correlating with orphan SIDs/broken links.\n\n## MAQ Evasion with Self-Deleting Computers\n\n- Default **`ms-DS-MachineAccountQuota`\
  \ = 10** lets any authenticated user create computers. Add `dynamicObject` during creation to have the computer self-delete\
  \ and **free the quota slot** while wiping evidence.\n- Powermad tweak inside `New-MachineAccount` (objectClass list):\n\
  \  ```powershell\n  $request.Attributes.Add((New-Object \"System.DirectoryServices.Protocols.DirectoryAttribute\" -ArgumentList\
  \ \"objectClass\", \"dynamicObject\", \"Computer\")) > $null\n  ```\n- Short TTL (e.g., 60s) often fails for standard users;\
  \ AD falls back to **`DynamicObjectDefaultTTL`** (example: 86,400s). ADUC may hide `entryTTL`, but LDP/LDAP queries reveal\
  \ it.\n\n## Stealth Primary Group Membership\n\n- Create a **dynamic security group**, then set a user’s **`primaryGroupID`**\
  \ to that group’s RID to gain effective membership that **doesn’t show in `memberOf`** but is honored in Kerberos/access\
  \ tokens.\n- TTL expiry **deletes the group despite primary-group delete protection**, leaving the user with a corrupted\
  \ `primaryGroupID` pointing to a non-existent RID and no tombstone to investigate how the privilege was granted.\n\n## AdminSDHolder\
  \ Orphan-SID Pollution\n\n- Add ACEs for a **short-lived dynamic user/group** to **`CN=AdminSDHolder,CN=System,...`**. After\
  \ TTL expiry the SID becomes **unresolvable (“Unknown SID”)** in the template ACL, and **SDProp (~60 min)** propagates that\
  \ orphan SID across all protected Tier-0 objects.\n- Forensics lose attribution because the principal is gone (no deleted-object\
  \ DN). Monitor for **new dynamic principals + sudden orphan SIDs on AdminSDHolder/privileged ACLs**.\n\n## Dynamic GPO Execution\
  \ with Self-Destructing Evidence\n\n- Create a **dynamic `groupPolicyContainer`** object with a malicious **`gPCFileSysPath`**\
  \ (e.g., SMB share à la GPODDITY) and **link it via `gPLink`** to a target OU.\n- Clients process the policy and pull content\
  \ from attacker SMB. When TTL expires, the GPO object (and `gPCFileSysPath`) vanishes; only a **broken `gPLink`** GUID remains,\
  \ removing LDAP evidence of the executed payload.\n\n## Ephemeral AD-Integrated DNS Redirection\n\n- AD DNS records are\
  \ **`dnsNode`** objects in **DomainDnsZones/ForestDnsZones**. Creating them as **dynamic objects** allows temporary host\
  \ redirection (credential capture/MITM). Clients cache the malicious A/AAAA response; the record later self-deletes so the\
  \ zone looks clean (DNS Manager may need zone reload to refresh view).\n- Detection: alert on **any DNS record carrying\
  \ `dynamicObject`/`entryTTL`** via replication/event logs; transient records rarely appear in standard DNS logs.\n\n## Hybrid\
  \ Entra ID Delta-Sync Gap (Note)\n\n- Entra Connect delta sync relies on **tombstones** to detect deletes. A **dynamic on-prem\
  \ user** can sync to Entra ID, expire, and delete without tombstone—delta sync won’t remove the cloud account, leaving an\
  \ **orphaned active Entra user** until a manual **full sync** is forced.\n\n## References\n\n- [Dynamic Objects in Active\
