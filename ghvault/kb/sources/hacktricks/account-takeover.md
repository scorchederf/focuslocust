_body: "# Account Takeover\n\n{{#include ../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n## **Authorization Issue**\n\nThe email of\
  \ an account should be attempted to be changed, and the confirmation process **must be examined**. If found to be **weak**,\
  \ the email should be changed to that of the intended victim and then confirmed.\n\n## **Unicode Normalization Issue**\n\
  \n1. The account of the intended victim `victim@gmail.com`\n2. An account should be created using Unicode\\\n   for example:\
  \ `vićtim@gmail.com`\n\nAs explained in [**this talk**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiIyaZ3x49c), the previous attack\
  \ could also be done abusing third party identity providers:\n\n- Create an account in the third party identity with similar\
  \ email to the victim using some unicode character (`vićtim@company.com`).\n  - The third party provider shouldn't verify\
  \ the email\n  - If the identity provider verifies the email, maybe you can attack the domain part like: `victim@ćompany.com`\
  \ and register that domain and hope that the identity provider generates the ascii version of the domain while the victim\
  \ platform normalize the domain name.\n- Login via this identity provider in the victim platform who should normalize the\
  \ unicode character and allow you to access the victim account.\n\nFor further details, refer to the document on Unicode\
  \ Normalization:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nunicode-injection/unicode-normalization.md\n{{#endref}}\n\n## **Reusing Reset Token**\n\n\
  Should the target system allow the **reset link to be reused**, efforts should be made to **find more reset links** using\
  \ tools such as `gau`, `wayback`, or `scan.io`.\n\n## **Pre Account Takeover**\n\n1. The victim's email should be used to\
  \ sign up on the platform, and a password should be set (an attempt to confirm it should be made, although lacking access\
  \ to the victim's emails might render this impossible).\n2. One should wait until the victim signs up using OAuth and confirms\
  \ the account.\n3. It is hoped that the regular signup will be confirmed, allowing access to the victim's account.\n\n##\
  \ **CORS Misconfiguration to Account Takeover**\n\nIf the page contains **CORS misconfigurations** you might be able to\
  \ **steal sensitive information** from the user to **takeover his account** or make him change auth information for the\
  \ same purpose:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\ncors-bypass.md\n{{#endref}}\n\n## **Csrf to Account Takeover**\n\nIf the page is vulnerable\
  \ to CSRF you might be able to make the **user modify his password**, email or authentication so you can then access it:\n\
  \n\n{{#ref}}\ncsrf-cross-site-request-forgery.md\n{{#endref}}\n\n## **XSS to Account Takeover**\n\nIf you find a XSS in\
  \ application you might be able to steal cookies, local storage, or info from the web page that could allow you takeover\
  \ the account:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nxss-cross-site-scripting/\n{{#endref}}\n\n- Attribute-only reflected payloads on login pages\
  \ can hook `document.onkeypress`, exfiltrate keystrokes through `new Image().src`, and steal credentials without submitting\
  \ the form. See [Attribute-only login XSS behind WAFs](xss-cross-site-scripting/README.md#attribute-only-login-xss-behind-wafs)\
  \ for a practical workflow.\n\n## **Same Origin + Cookies**\n\nIf you find a limited XSS or a subdomain take over, you could\
  \ play with the cookies (fixating them for example) to try to compromise the victim account:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nhacking-with-cookies/\n\
  {{#endref}}\n\n## **Attacking Password Reset Mechanism**\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nreset-password.md\n{{#endref}}\n\n## Security-question\
  \ resets that trust client-supplied usernames\nIf an \"update security questions\" flow takes a `username` parameter even\
  \ though the caller is already authenticated, you can overwrite any account's recovery data (including admins) because the\
  \ backend typically runs `UPDATE ... WHERE user_name = ?` with your untrusted value. The pattern is:\n\n1. Log in with a\
  \ throwaway user and capture the session cookie.\n2. Submit the victim username plus new answers via the reset form.\n3.\
  \ Immediately authenticate through the security-question login endpoint using the answers you just injected to inherit the\
  \ victim's privileges.\n\n```http\nPOST /reset.php HTTP/1.1\nHost: file.era.htb\nCookie: PHPSESSID=<low-priv>\nContent-Type:\
  \ application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n\nusername=admin_ef01cab31aa&new_answer1=A&new_answer2=B&new_answer3=C\n```\n\nAnything\
  \ gated by the victim's `$_SESSION` context (admin dashboards, dangerous stream-wrapper features, etc.) is now exposed without\
  \ touching the real answers.\n\nEnumerated usernames can then be targeted via the overwrite technique above or reused against\
  \ ancillary services (FTP/SSH password spraying).\n\n## **Response Manipulation**\n\nIf the authentication response could\
  \ be **reduced to a simple boolean just try to change false to true** and see if you get any access.\n\n## OAuth to Account\
  \ takeover\n\n\n{{#ref}}\noauth-to-account-takeover.md\n{{#endref}}\n\n## Host Header Injection\n\n1. The Host header is\
  \ modified following a password reset request initiation.\n2. The `X-Forwarded-For` proxy header is altered to `attacker.com`.\n\
  3. The Host, Referrer, and Origin headers are simultaneously changed to `attacker.com`.\n4. After initiating a password\
  \ reset and then opting to resend the mail, all three of the aforementioned methods are employed.\n\n## Response Manipulation\n\
  \n1. **Code Manipulation**: The status code is altered to `200 OK`.\n2. **Code and Body Manipulation**:\n   - The status\
  \ code is changed to `200 OK`.\n   - The response body is modified to `{\"success\":true}` or an empty object `{}`.\n\n\
  These manipulation techniques are effective in scenarios where JSON is utilized for data transmission and receipt.\n\n##\
  \ Change email of current session\n\nFrom [this report](https://dynnyd20.medium.com/one-click-account-take-over-e500929656ea):\n\
  \n- Attacker requests to change his email with a new one\n- Attacker receives a link to confirm the change of the email\n\
  - Attacker send the victim the link so he clicks it\n- The victims email is changed to the one indicated by the attacker\n\
  - The attack can recover the password and take over the account\n\nThis also happened in [**this report**](https://dynnyd20.medium.com/one-click-account-take-over-e500929656ea).\n\
  \n\n### Bypass email verification for Account Takeover\n- Attacker logins with attacker@test.com and verifies email upon\
  \ signup.\n- Attacker changes verified email to victim@test.com (no secondary verification on email change)\n- Now the website\
  \ allows victim@test.com to login and we have bypassed email verification of victim user.\n\n### Old Cookies\n\nAs explained\
  \ [**in this post**](https://medium.com/@niraj1mahajan/uncovering-the-hidden-vulnerability-how-i-found-an-authentication-bypass-on-shopifys-exchange-cc2729ea31a9),\
  \ it was possible to login into an account, save the cookies as an authenticated user, logout, and then login again.\\\n\
  With the new login, although different cookies might be generated the old ones became to work again.\n\n### Trusted device\
  \ cookies + batch API leakage\n\n*Long-lived device identifiers that gate recovery can be stolen when a batch API lets you\
  \ copy unreadable subresponses into writable sinks.*\n\n- Identify a **trusted-device cookie** (`SameSite=None`, long-lived)\
  \ used to relax recovery checks.\n- Find a **first-party endpoint** that returns that device ID in JSON (e.g., an OAuth\
  \ `code` exchange returning `machine_id`) but is not readable cross-origin.\n- Use a **batch/chained API** that allows referencing\
  \ earlier subresponses (`{result=name:$.path}`) and writing them to an attacker-visible sink (page post, upload-by-URL,\
  \ etc.). Example with Facebook Graph API:\n\n```http\nPOST https://graph.facebook.com/\nbatch=[\n  {\"method\":\"post\"\
  ,\"omit_response_on_success\":0,\"relative_url\":\"/oauth/access_token?client_id=APP_ID%26redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URI\",\"\
  body\":\"code=SINGLE_USE_CODE\",\"name\":\"leaker\"},\n  {\"method\":\"post\",\"relative_url\":\"PAGE_ID/posts\",\"body\"\
  :\"message={result=leaker:$.machine_id}\"}\n]\naccess_token=PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN&method=post\n```\n\n- Load the batch URL in\
  \ a hidden `<iframe>` so the victim sends the trusted-device cookie; the JSON-path reference copies `machine_id` into the\
  \ attacker-controlled post even though the OAuth response is unreadable to the page.\n- Replay: set the stolen device cookie\
  \ in a new session. Recovery now treats the browser as trusted, often exposing weaker “no email/phone” flows (e.g., automated\
  \ document upload) to add an attacker email without the password or 2FA.\n\n## References\n\n- [https://blog.hackcommander.com/posts/2025/12/28/turning-a-harmless-xss-behind-a-waf-into-a-realistic-phishing-vector/](https://blog.hackcommander.com/posts/2025/12/28/turning-a-harmless-xss-behind-a-waf-into-a-realistic-phishing-vector/)\n\
