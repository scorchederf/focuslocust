_body: "# MediaTek bl2_ext Secure-Boot Bypass (EL3 Code Execution)\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n\
  This page documents a practical secure-boot break on multiple MediaTek platforms by abusing a verification gap when the\
  \ device bootloader configuration (seccfg) is \"unlocked\". The flaw allows running a patched bl2_ext at ARM EL3 to disable\
  \ downstream signature verification, collapsing the chain of trust and enabling arbitrary unsigned TEE/GZ/LK/Kernel loading.\n\
  \n> Caution: Early-boot patching can permanently brick devices if offsets are wrong. Always keep full dumps and a reliable\
  \ recovery path.\n\n## Affected boot flow (MediaTek)\n\n- Normal path: BootROM → Preloader → bl2_ext (EL3, verified) → TEE\
  \ → GenieZone (GZ) → LK/AEE → Linux kernel (EL1)\n- Vulnerable path: When seccfg is set to unlocked, Preloader may skip\
  \ verifying bl2_ext. Preloader still jumps into bl2_ext at EL3, so a crafted bl2_ext can load unverified components thereafter.\n\
  \nKey trust boundary:\n- bl2_ext executes at EL3 and is responsible for verifying TEE, GenieZone, LK/AEE and the kernel.\
  \ If bl2_ext itself is not authenticated, the rest of the chain is trivially bypassed.\n\n## Root cause\n\nOn affected devices,\
  \ the Preloader does not enforce authentication of the bl2_ext partition when seccfg indicates an \"unlocked\" state. This\
  \ allows flashing an attacker-controlled bl2_ext that runs at EL3.\n\nInside bl2_ext, the verification policy function can\
  \ be patched to unconditionally report that verification is not required (or always succeeds), forcing the boot chain to\
  \ accept unsigned TEE/GZ/LK/Kernel images. Because this patch runs at EL3, it is effective even if downstream components\
  \ implement their own checks.\n\n## Practical exploit chain\n\n1. Obtain bootloader partitions (Preloader, bl2_ext, LK/AEE,\
  \ etc.) via OTA/firmware packages, EDL/DA readback, or hardware dumping.\n2. Identify bl2_ext verification routine and patch\
  \ it to always skip/accept verification.\n3. Flash modified bl2_ext using fastboot, DA, or similar maintenance channels\
  \ that are still allowed on unlocked devices.\n4. Reboot; Preloader jumps to patched bl2_ext at EL3 which then loads unsigned\
  \ downstream images (patched TEE/GZ/LK/Kernel) and disables signature enforcement.\n\nIf the device is configured as locked\
  \ (seccfg locked), the Preloader is expected to verify bl2_ext. In that configuration, this attack will fail unless another\
  \ vulnerability permits loading an unsigned bl2_ext.\n\n## Triage (expdb boot logs)\n\n- Dump boot/expdb logs around the\
  \ bl2_ext load. If `img_auth_required = 0` and certificate verification time is ~0 ms, verification is likely skipped.\n\
  \nExample log excerpt:\n\n```\n[PART] img_auth_required = 0\n[PART] Image with header, name: bl2_ext, addr: FFFFFFFFh, mode:\
  \ FFFFFFFFh, size:654944, magic:58881688h\n[PART] part: lk_a img: bl2_ext cert vfy(0 ms)\n```\n\n- Some devices skip bl2_ext\
  \ verification even when locked; lk2 secondary bootloader paths have shown the same gap. If a post-OTA Preloader logs `img_auth_required\
  \ = 1` for bl2_ext while unlocked, enforcement was likely restored.\n\n## Verification logic locations\n\n- The relevant\
  \ check typically resides inside the bl2_ext image in functions named similarly to `verify_img` or `sec_img_auth`.\n- The\
  \ patched version forces the function to return success or to bypass the verification call entirely.\n\nExample patch approach\
  \ (conceptual):\n- Locate the function that calls `sec_img_auth` on TEE, GZ, LK, and kernel images.\n- Replace its body\
  \ with a stub that immediately returns success, or overwrite the conditional branch that handles verification failure.\n\
  \nEnsure the patch preserves stack/frame setup and returns expected status codes to callers.\n\n## Fenrir PoC workflow (Nothing/CMF)\n\
  \nFenrir is a reference patching toolkit for this issue (Nothing Phone (2a) fully supported; CMF Phone 1 partially). High\
  \ level:\n- Place the device bootloader image as `bin/<device>.bin`.\n- Build a patched image that disables the bl2_ext\
  \ verification policy.\n- Flash the resulting payload (fastboot helper provided).\n\n```bash\n./build.sh pacman        \
  \            # build from bin/pacman.bin\n./build.sh pacman /path/to/boot.bin  # build from a custom bootloader path\n./flash.sh\
  \                           # flash via fastboot\n```\n\nUse another flashing channel if fastboot is unavailable.\n\n##\
  \ EL3 patching notes\n\n- bl2_ext executes in ARM EL3. Crashes here can brick a device until reflashed via EDL/DA or test\
  \ points.\n- Use board-specific logging/UART to validate execution path and diagnose crashes.\n- Keep backups of all partitions\
  \ being modified and test on disposable hardware first.\n\n## Implications\n\n- EL3 code execution after Preloader and full\
  \ chain-of-trust collapse for the rest of the boot path.\n- Ability to boot unsigned TEE/GZ/LK/Kernel, bypassing secure/verified\
  \ boot expectations and enabling persistent compromise.\n\n## Device notes\n\n- Confirmed supported: Nothing Phone (2a)\
  \ (Pacman)\n- Known working (incomplete support): CMF Phone 1 (Tetris)\n- Observed: Vivo X80 Pro reportedly did not verify\
  \ bl2_ext even when locked\n- NothingOS 4 stable (BP2A.250605.031.A3, Nov 2025) re-enabled bl2_ext verification; fenrir\
  \ `pacman-v2.0` restores the bypass by mixing the beta Preloader with a patched LK\n- Industry coverage highlights additional\
  \ lk2-based vendors shipping the same logic flaw, so expect further overlap across 2024–2025 MTK releases.\n\n## MTK DA\
  \ readback and seccfg manipulation with Penumbra\n\nPenumbra is a Rust crate/CLI/TUI that automates interaction with MTK\
  \ preloader/bootrom over USB for DA-mode operations. With physical access to a vulnerable handset (DA extensions allowed),\
  \ it can discover the MTK USB port, load a Download Agent (DA) blob, and issue privileged commands such as seccfg lock flipping\
  \ and partition readback.\n\n- **Environment/driver setup**: On Linux install `libudev`, add the user to the `dialout` group,\
  \ and create udev rules or run with `sudo` if the device node is not accessible. Windows support is unreliable; it sometimes\
  \ works only after replacing the MTK driver with WinUSB using Zadig (per project guidance).\n- **Workflow**: Read a DA payload\
  \ (e.g., `std::fs::read(\"../DA_penangf.bin\")`), poll for the MTK port with `find_mtk_port()`, and build a session using\
  \ `DeviceBuilder::with_mtk_port(...).with_da_data(...)`. After `init()` completes the handshake and gathers device info,\
  \ check protections via `dev_info.target_config()` bitfields (bit 0 set → SBC enabled). Enter DA mode and attempt `set_seccfg_lock_state(LockFlag::Unlock)`—this\
  \ only succeeds if the device accepts extensions. Partitions can be dumped with `read_partition(\"lk_a\", &mut progress_cb,\
  \ &mut writer)` for offline analysis or patching.\n- **Security impact**: Successful seccfg unlocking reopens flashing paths\
  \ for unsigned boot images, enabling persistent compromises such as the bl2_ext EL3 patching described above. Partition\
  \ readback provides firmware artifacts for reverse engineering and crafting modified images.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Rust\
  \ DA session + seccfg unlock + partition dump (Penumbra)</summary>\n\n```rust\nuse tokio::fs::File;\nuse anyhow::Result;\n\
  use penumbra::{DeviceBuilder, LockFlag, find_mtk_port};\nuse tokio::io::{AsyncWriteExt, BufWriter};\n\n#[tokio::main]\n\

  \n    let mut progress = |_read: usize, _total: usize| {};\n    let mut writer = BufWriter::new(File::create(\"lk_a.bin\"\
  )?);\n    dev.read_partition(\"lk_a\", &mut progress, &mut writer).await?;\n    writer.flush().await?;\n    Ok(())\n}\n\
