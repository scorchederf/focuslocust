  \ id=\"how-the-infrared-port-works\"></a>\n\n**Infrared light is invisible to humans**. IR wavelength is from **0.7 to 1000\
  \ microns**. Household remotes use an IR signal for data transmission and operate in the wavelength range of 0.75..1.4 microns.\
  \ A microcontroller in the remote makes an infrared LED blink with a specific frequency, turning the digital signal into\
  \ an IR signal.\n\nTo receive IR signals a **photoreceiver** is used. It **converts IR light into voltage pulses**, which\
  \ are already **digital signals**. Usually, there is a **dark light filter inside the receiver**, which lets **only the\
  \ desired wavelength through** and cuts out noise.\n\n### Variety of IR Protocols <a href=\"#variety-of-ir-protocols\" id=\"\
  variety-of-ir-protocols\"></a>\n\nIR protocols differ in 3 factors:\n\n- bit encoding\n- data structure\n- carrier frequency\
  \ — often in range 36..38 kHz\n\n#### Bit encoding ways <a href=\"#bit-encoding-ways\" id=\"bit-encoding-ways\"></a>\n\n\
  **1. Pulse Distance Encoding**\n\nBits are encoded by modulating the duration of the space between pulses. The width of\
  \ the pulse itself is constant.\n\n<figure><img src=\"../../images/image (295).png\" alt=\"\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\
  \n**2. Pulse Width Encoding**\n\nBits are encoded by modulation of the pulse width. The width of space after pulse burst\
  \ is constant.\n\n<figure><img src=\"../../images/image (282).png\" alt=\"\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n**3.\
  \ Phase Encoding**\n\nIt is also known as Manchester encoding. The logical value is defined by the polarity of the transition\
  \ between pulse burst and space. \"Space to pulse burst\" denotes logic \"0\", \"pulse burst to space\" denotes logic \"\
  1\".\n\n<figure><img src=\"../../images/image (634).png\" alt=\"\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n**4. Combination\
  \ of previous ones and other exotics**\n\n> [!TIP]\n> There are IR protocols that are **trying to become universal** for\
  \ several types of devices. The most famous ones are RC5 and NEC. Unfortunately, the most famous **does not mean the most\
  \ common**. In my environment, I met just two NEC remotes and no RC5 ones.\n>\n> Manufacturers love to use their own unique\
  \ IR protocols, even within the same range of devices (for example, TV-boxes). Therefore, remotes from different companies\
  \ and sometimes from different models from the same company, are unable to work with other devices of the same type.\n\n\
  ### Exploring an IR signal\n\nThe most reliable way to see how the remote IR signal looks like is to use an oscilloscope.\
  \ It does not demodulate or invert the received signal, it is just displayed \"as is\". This is useful for testing and debugging.\
  \ I will show the expected signal on the example of the NEC IR protocol.\n\n<figure><img src=\"../../images/image (235).png\"\
  \ alt=\"\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\nUsually, there is a preamble at the beginning of an encoded packet. This\
  \ allows the receiver to determine the level of gain and background. There are also protocols without preamble, for example,\
  \ Sharp.\n\nThen data is transmitted. The structure, preamble, and bit encoding method are determined by the specific protocol.\n\
  \n**NEC IR protocol** contains a short command and a repeat code, which is sent while the button is pressed. Both the command\
  \ and the repeat code have the same preamble at the beginning.\n\nNEC **command**, in addition to the preamble, consists\
  \ of an address byte and a command-number byte, by which the device understands what needs to be performed. Address and\
  \ command-number bytes are duplicated with inverse values, to check the integrity of the transmission. There is an additional\
  \ stop bit at the end of the command.\n\nThe **repeat code** has a \"1\" after the preamble, which is a stop bit.\n\nFor\
  \ **logic \"0\" and \"1\"** NEC uses Pulse Distance Encoding: first, a pulse burst is transmitted after which there is a\
  \ pause, its length sets the value of the bit.\n\n### Air Conditioners\n\nUnlike other remotes, **air conditioners do not\
  \ transmit just the code of the pressed button**. They also **transmit all the information** when a button is pressed to\
  \ assure that the **air conditioned machine and the remote are synchronised**.\\\nThis will avoid that a machine set as\
  \ 20ºC is increased to 21ºC with one remote, and then when another remote, which still has the temperature as 20ºC, is used\
  \ to increase more the temperature, it will \"increase\" it to 21ºC (and not to 22ºC thinking it's in 21ºC).\n\n---\n\n\
  ## Attacks & Offensive Research <a href=\"#attacks\" id=\"attacks\"></a>\n\nYou can attack Infrared with Flipper Zero:\n\
  \n\n{{#ref}}\nflipper-zero/fz-infrared.md\n{{#endref}}\n\n### Smart-TV / Set-top Box Takeover (EvilScreen)\n\nRecent academic\
  \ work (EvilScreen, 2022) demonstrated that **multi-channel remotes that combine Infrared with Bluetooth or Wi-Fi can be\
  \ abused to fully hijack modern smart-TVs**. The attack chains high-privilege IR service codes together with authenticated\
  \ Bluetooth packets, bypassing channel-isolation and allowing arbitrary app launches, microphone activation, or factory-reset\
  \ without physical access. Eight mainstream TVs from different vendors — including a Samsung model claiming ISO/IEC 27001\
  \ compliance — were confirmed vulnerable. Mitigation requires vendor firmware fixes or completely disabling unused IR receivers.\
  \ \n\n### Air-Gapped Data Exfiltration via IR LEDs (aIR-Jumper family)\n\nSecurity cameras, routers or even malicious USB\
  \ sticks often include **night-vision IR LEDs**. Research shows malware can modulate these LEDs (<10–20 kbit/s with simple\
  \ OOK) to **exfiltrate secrets through walls and windows** to an external camera placed tens of metres away. Because the\
  \ light is outside the visible spectrum, operators rarely notice. Counter-measures:\n\n* Physically shield or remove IR\
  \ LEDs in sensitive areas\n* Monitor camera LED duty-cycle and firmware integrity\n* Deploy IR-cut filters on windows and\
  \ surveillance cameras\n\nAn attacker can also use strong IR projectors to **infiltrate** commands into the network by flashing\
  \ data back to insecure cameras. \n\n### Long-Range Brute-Force & Extended Protocols with Flipper Zero 1.0\n\nFirmware 1.0\
  \ (September 2024) added **dozens of extra IR protocols and optional external amplifier modules**. Combined with the universal-remote\
  \ brute-force mode, a Flipper can disable or reconfigure most public TVs/ACs from up to 30 m using a high-power diode. \n\
  \n---\n\n## Tooling & Practical Examples <a href=\"#tooling\" id=\"tooling\"></a>\n\n### Hardware\n\n* **Flipper Zero**\
  \ – portable transceiver with learning, replay and dictionary-bruteforce modes (see above).\n* **Arduino / ESP32** + IR\
  \ LED / TSOP38xx receiver – cheap DIY analyser/transmitter. Combine with the `Arduino-IRremote` library (v4.x supports >40\
  \ protocols).\n* **Logic analysers** (Saleae/FX2) – capture raw timings when protocol is unknown.\n* **Smartphones with\
  \ IR-blaster** (e.g., Xiaomi) – quick field test but limited range.\n\n### Software\n\n* **`Arduino-IRremote`** – actively-maintained\
  \ C++ library: \n  ```cpp\n  #include <IRremote.hpp>\n  IRsend sender;\n  void setup(){ sender.begin(); }\n  void loop(){\n\
  \    sender.sendNEC(0x20DF10EF, 32); // Samsung TV Power\n    delay(5000);\n  }\n  ```\n* **IRscrutinizer / AnalysIR** –\
  \ GUI decoders that import raw captures and auto-identify protocol + generate Pronto/Arduino code.\n* **LIRC / ir-keytable\
  \ (Linux)** – receive and inject IR from the command line:\n  ```bash\n  sudo ir-keytable -p nec,rc5 -t   # live-dump decoded\
  \ scancodes\n  irsend SEND_ONCE samsung KEY_POWER\n  ```\n\n---\n\n## Defensive Measures <a href=\"#defense\" id=\"defense\"\
  ></a>\n\n* Disable or cover IR receivers on devices deployed in public spaces when not required.\n* Enforce *pairing* or\
  \ cryptographic checks between smart-TVs and remotes; isolate privileged “service” codes.\n* Deploy IR-cut filters or continuous-wave\
  \ detectors around classified areas to break optical covert channels.\n* Monitor firmware integrity of cameras/IoT appliances\
  \ that expose controllable IR LEDs.\n\n## References\n\n- [Flipper Zero Infrared blog post](https://blog.flipperzero.one/infrared/)\n\
