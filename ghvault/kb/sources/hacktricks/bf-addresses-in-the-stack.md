  \ protected by a canary and PIE (Position Independent Executable) you probably need to find a way to bypass them.**\n\n\
  ![](<../../../images/image (865).png>)\n\n> [!TIP]\n> Note that **`checksec`** might not find that a binary is protected\
  \ by a canary if this was statically compiled and it's not capable to identify the function.\\\n> However, you can manually\
  \ notice this if you find that a value is saved in the stack at the beginning of a function call and this value is checked\
  \ before exiting.\n\n## Brute-Force Addresses\n\nIn order to **bypass the PIE** you need to **leak some address**. And if\
  \ the binary is not leaking any addresses the best to do it is to **brute-force the RBP and RIP saved in the stack** in\
  \ the vulnerable function.\\\nFor example, if a binary is protected using both a **canary** and **PIE**, you can start brute-forcing\
  \ the canary, then the **next** 8 Bytes (x64) will be the saved **RBP** and the **next** 8 Bytes will be the saved **RIP.**\n\
  \n> [!TIP]\n> It's supposed that the return address inside the stack belongs to the main binary code, which, if the vulnerability\
  \ is located in the binary code, will usually be the case.\n\nThis technique is specially useful when **each failed probe\
  \ only kills the current worker but does not rerandomize the parent state** (for example, a `fork()`-per-connection server\
  \ or a service that respawns workers without `execve()`). If you first need to brute-force the canary in that scenario,\
  \ check [BF Forked & Threaded Stack Canaries](../stack-canaries/bf-forked-stack-canaries.md).\n\nTo brute-force the RBP\
  \ and the RIP from the binary you can figure out that a valid guessed byte is correct if the program outputs something or\
  \ it just doesn't crash. The **same primitive** used to brute-force the canary can be reused to leak the saved `RBP` and\
  \ the saved `RIP`:\n\n<details>\n<summary>Python3 helper to brute-force the canary, saved RBP and saved RIP</summary>\n\n\
  ```python\nfrom pwn import *\n\nHOST, PORT = \"localhost\", 8788\n\n\ndef connect():\n    return remote(HOST, PORT)\n\n\n\
  def brute_qword(prefix, prompt=b\"Username: \", success=b\"SOME OUTPUT\"):\n    leaked = b\"\"\n\n    while len(leaked)\
  \ < 8:\n        for guess in range(0x100):\n            io = connect()\n            io.recvuntil(prompt)\n            io.send(prefix\
  \ + leaked + bytes([guess]))\n            out = io.clean(timeout=0.2)\n            io.close()\n\n            if success\
  \ in out:\n                leaked += bytes([guess])\n                log.info(\"byte %d = %#x\", len(leaked), guess)\n \
  \               break\n        else:\n            raise RuntimeError(\"No valid byte found\")\n\n    return prefix + leaked\n\
  \n\noffset = 1176\npayload = b\"A\" * offset\n\npayload = brute_qword(payload)  # canary\nCANARY = u64(payload[-8:])\n\n\
  payload = brute_qword(payload)  # saved RBP\nRBP = u64(payload[-8:])\n\npayload = brute_qword(payload)  # saved RIP\nRIP\
  \ = u64(payload[-8:])\n```\n\n</details>\n\nIf the target reads with `gets`/`fgets`-style functions, remember to remove\
  \ terminators such as `\\n` from the candidate alphabet. With `read`/`recv`, brute-forcing all byte values is usually fine.\n\
  \nThe last thing you need to defeat the PIE is to calculate **useful addresses from the leaked** addresses: the **RBP**\
  \ and the **RIP**.\n\nFrom the **RBP** you can calculate **where are you writing your shell in the stack**. This can be\
  \ very useful to know where are you going to write the string _\"/bin/sh\\x00\"_ inside the stack. To calculate the distance\
  \ between the leaked RBP and your shellcode you can just put a **breakpoint after leaking the RBP** an check **where is\
  \ your shellcode located**, then, you can calculate the distance between the shellcode and the RBP:\n\n```python\nINI_SHELLCODE\
  \ = RBP - 1152\n```\n\nFrom the **RIP** you can calculate the **base address of the PIE binary** which is what you are going\
  \ to need to create a **valid ROP chain**.\\\nTo calculate the base address, disassemble the binary and identify the **exact\
  \ static offset of the return site** pointed to by the saved `RIP` (`objdump -d`, `r2 -A`, `gef`, `pwndbg`, etc.):\n\n![](<../../../images/image\
  \ (479).png>)\n\nThe **reliable** calculation is to subtract that static offset from the leaked runtime address:\n\n```python\n\
  RET_OFFSET = 0x13cf  # example: instruction after the call to the vulnerable function\nelf.address = RIP - RET_OFFSET\n\
  assert elf.address & 0xfff == 0\n```\n\nIf the leaked `RIP` is known to belong to the **first executable page** of a small\
  \ binary, page-aligning it can still be enough as a quick shortcut or sanity check. For example, if you leak `0x562002970ecf`,\
  \ then the page containing that instruction starts at `0x562002970000`:\n\n```python\npage_base = RIP - (RIP & 0xfff)\n\
  ```\n\n## Improvements\n\nBlindly treating **\"no crash\"** as **\"correct byte\"** is fragile for saved `RBP` and saved\
  \ `RIP` values. In practice, the following tweaks make this attack much more reliable:\n\n- **Use timeouts for saved `RBP`\
  \ guesses**: a wrong value used by `leave; ret` may survive longer than a bad canary or a bad return address, so remote\
  \ targets usually need a larger timeout than local tests.\n- **Introduce a short delay between probes**: sending requests\
  \ too quickly can leave many workers/processes around, fill memory, or accumulate `TIME_WAIT` sockets, creating false positives\
  \ unrelated to the guessed byte.\n- **Do not brute-force bytes you already know**: if disassembly shows that the target\
  \ return site must end in a fixed tail such as `...e06`, brute-force only the randomized byte or nibble(s). On amd64, the\
  \ low 12 bits inside the page are constant for a given return site.\n- **Validate candidates more than once**: a wrong `RIP`\
  \ can still return into valid code and print output. Requiring the same candidate to succeed several times, or validating\
  \ it with a known stop gadget as in [BROP](../../rop-return-oriented-programing/brop-blind-return-oriented-programming.md),\
  \ reduces false positives.\n- **Re-check the stack delta after leaking `RBP`**: the distance from the leaked frame pointer\
  \ to your controlled buffer can change with stack alignment, so measure that delta for the leaked frame layout instead of\
  \ assuming a single constant.\n\n## References\n\n- [https://github.com/datajerk/ctf-write-ups/blob/master/nahamconctf2020/ripe_reader/README.md](https://github.com/datajerk/ctf-write-ups/blob/master/nahamconctf2020/ripe_reader/README.md)\n\
