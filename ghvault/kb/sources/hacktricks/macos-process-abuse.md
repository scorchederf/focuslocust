_body: "# macOS Process Abuse\n\n{{#include ../../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n## Processes Basic Information\n\n\
  A process is an instance of a running executable, however processes doesn't run code, these are threads. Therefore **processes\
  \ are just containers for running threads** providing the memory, descriptors, ports, permissions...\n\nTraditionally, processes\
  \ where started within other processes (except PID 1) by calling **`fork`** which would create a exact copy of the current\
  \ process and then the **child process** would generally call **`execve`** to load the new executable and run it. Then,\
  \ **`vfork`** was introduced to make this process faster without any memory copying.\\\nThen **`posix_spawn`** was introduced\
  \ combining **`vfork`** and **`execve`** in one call and accepting flags:\n\n- `POSIX_SPAWN_RESETIDS`: Reset effective ids\
  \ to real ids\n- `POSIX_SPAWN_SETPGROUP`: Set process group affiliation\n- `POSUX_SPAWN_SETSIGDEF`: Set signal default behaviour\n\
  - `POSIX_SPAWN_SETSIGMASK`: Set signal mask\n- `POSIX_SPAWN_SETEXEC`: Exec in the same process (like `execve` with more\
  \ options)\n- `POSIX_SPAWN_START_SUSPENDED`: Start suspended\n- `_POSIX_SPAWN_DISABLE_ASLR`: Start without ASLR\n- `_POSIX_SPAWN_NANO_ALLOCATOR:`\
  \ Use libmalloc's Nano allocator\n- `_POSIX_SPAWN_ALLOW_DATA_EXEC:` Allow `rwx` on data segments\n- `POSIX_SPAWN_CLOEXEC_DEFAULT`:\
  \ Close all file descriptions on exec(2) by default\n- `_POSIX_SPAWN_HIGH_BITS_ASLR:` Randomize high bits of ASLR slide\n\
  \nMoreover, `posix_spawn` allows to specify an array of **`posix_spawnattr`** that controls some aspects of the spawned\
  \ process, and **`posix_spawn_file_actions`** to modify the state of the descriptors.\n\nWhen a process dies it send the\
  \ **return code to the parent process** (if the parent died, the new parent is PID 1) with the signal `SIGCHLD`. The parent\
  \ needs to get this value calling `wait4()` or `waitid()` and until that happen the child stays in a zombie state where\
  \ it's still listed but doesn't consume resources.\n\n### PIDs\n\nPIDs, process identifiers, identifies a uniq process.\
  \ In XNU the **PIDs** are of **64bits** increasing monotonically and **never wrap** (to avoid abuses).\n\n### Process Groups,\
  \ Sessions & Coalations\n\n**Processes** can be inserted in **groups** to make it easier to handle them. For example, commands\
  \ in a shell script will be in the same process group so it's possible to **signal them together** using kill for example.\\\
  \nIt's also possible to **group processes in sessions**. When a process starts a session (`setsid(2)`), the children processes\
  \ are set inside the session, unless they start their own session.\n\nCoalition is another waya to group processes in Darwin.\
  \ A process joining a coalation allows it to access pool resources, sharing a ledger or facing Jetsam. Coalations have different\
  \ roles: Leader, XPC service, Extension.\n\n### Credentials & Personae\n\nEach process with hold **credentials** that **identify\
  \ its privileges** in the system. Each process will have one primary `uid` and one primary `gid` (although might belong\
  \ to several groups).\\\nIt's also possible to change the user and group id if the binary has the `setuid/setgid` bit.\\\
  \nThere are several functions to **set new uids/gids**.\n\nThe syscall **`persona`** provides an **alternate** set of **credentials**.\
  \ Adopting a persona assumes its uid, gid and group memberships **at one**. In the [**source code**](https://github.com/apple/darwin-xnu/blob/main/bsd/sys/persona.h)\
  \ it's possible to find the struct:\n\n```c\nstruct kpersona_info { uint32_t persona_info_version;\n    uid_t    persona_id;\
  \ /* overlaps with UID */\n    int      persona_type;\n    gid_t    persona_gid;\n    uint32_t persona_ngroups;\n    gid_t\
  \    persona_groups[NGROUPS];\n    uid_t    persona_gmuid;\n    char     persona_name[MAXLOGNAME + 1];\n\n    /* TODO: MAC\
  \ policies?! */\n}\n```\n\n## Threads Basic Information\n\n1. **POSIX Threads (pthreads):** macOS supports POSIX threads\
  \ (`pthreads`), which are part of a standard threading API for C/C++. The implementation of pthreads in macOS is found in\
  \ `/usr/lib/system/libsystem_pthread.dylib`, which comes from the publicly available `libpthread` project. This library\
  \ provides the necessary functions to create and manage threads.\n2. **Creating Threads:** The `pthread_create()` function\
  \ is used to create new threads. Internally, this function calls `bsdthread_create()`, which is a lower-level system call\
  \ specific to the XNU kernel (the kernel macOS is based on). This system call takes various flags derived from `pthread_attr`\
  \ (attributes) that specify thread behavior, including scheduling policies and stack size.\n   - **Default Stack Size:**\
  \ The default stack size for new threads is 512 KB, which is sufficient for typical operations but can be adjusted via thread\
  \ attributes if more or less space is needed.\n3. **Thread Initialization:** The `__pthread_init()` function is crucial\
  \ during thread setup, utilizing the `env[]` argument to parse environment variables that can include details about the\
  \ stack's location and size.\n\n#### Thread Termination in macOS\n\n1. **Exiting Threads:** Threads are typically terminated\
  \ by calling `pthread_exit()`. This function allows a thread to exit cleanly, performing necessary cleanup and allowing\
  \ the thread to send a return value back to any joiners.\n2. **Thread Cleanup:** Upon calling `pthread_exit()`, the function\
  \ `pthread_terminate()` is invoked, which handles the removal of all associated thread structures. It deallocates Mach thread\
  \ ports (Mach is the communication subsystem in the XNU kernel) and calls `bsdthread_terminate`, a syscall that removes\
  \ the kernel-level structures associated with the thread.\n\n#### Synchronization Mechanisms\n\nTo manage access to shared\
  \ resources and avoid race conditions, macOS provides several synchronization primitives. These are critical in multi-threading\
  \ environments to ensure data integrity and system stability:\n\n1. **Mutexes:**\n   - **Regular Mutex (Signature: 0x4D555458):**\
  \ Standard mutex with a memory footprint of 60 bytes (56 bytes for the mutex and 4 bytes for the signature).\n   - **Fast\
  \ Mutex (Signature: 0x4d55545A):** Similar to a regular mutex but optimized for faster operations, also 60 bytes in size.\n\
  2. **Condition Variables:**\n   - Used for waiting for certain conditions to occur, with a size of 44 bytes (40 bytes plus\
  \ a 4-byte signature).\n   - **Condition Variable Attributes (Signature: 0x434e4441):** Configuration attributes for condition\
  \ variables, sized at 12 bytes.\n3. **Once Variable (Signature: 0x4f4e4345):**\n   - Ensures that a piece of initialization\
  \ code is executed only once. Its size is 12 bytes.\n4. **Read-Write Locks:**\n   - Allows multiple readers or one writer\
  \ at a time, facilitating efficient access to shared data.\n   - **Read Write Lock (Signature: 0x52574c4b):** Sized at 196\
  \ bytes.\n   - **Read Write Lock Attributes (Signature: 0x52574c41):** Attributes for read-write locks, 20 bytes in size.\n\
  \n> [!TIP]\n> The last 4 bytes of those objects are used to deetct overflows.\n\n### Thread Local Variables (TLV)\n\n**Thread\
  \ Local Variables (TLV)** in the context of Mach-O files (the format for executables in macOS) are used to declare variables\
  \ that are specific to **each thread** in a multi-threaded application. This ensures that each thread has its own separate\
  \ instance of a variable, providing a way to avoid conflicts and maintain data integrity without needing explicit synchronization\
  \ mechanisms like mutexes.\n\nIn C and related languages, you can declare a thread-local variable using the **`__thread`**\
  \ keyword. Here’s how it works in your example:\n\n```c\ncCopy code__thread int tlv_var;\n\nvoid main (int argc, char **argv){\n\
  \    tlv_var = 10;\n}\n```\n\nThis snippet defines `tlv_var` as a thread-local variable. Each thread running this code will\
  \ have its own `tlv_var`, and changes one thread makes to `tlv_var` will not affect `tlv_var` in another thread.\n\nIn the\
  \ Mach-O binary, the data related to thread local variables is organized into specific sections:\n\n- **`__DATA.__thread_vars`**:\
  \ This section contains the metadata about the thread-local variables, like their types and initialization status.\n- **`__DATA.__thread_bss`**:\
  \ This section is used for thread-local variables that are not explicitly initialized. It's a part of memory set aside for\
  \ zero-initialized data.\n\nMach-O also provides a specific API called **`tlv_atexit`** to manage thread-local variables\
  \ when a thread exits. This API allows you to **register destructors**—special functions that clean up thread-local data\
  \ when a thread terminates.\n\n### Threading Priorities\n\nUnderstanding thread priorities involves looking at how the operating\
  \ system decides which threads to run and when. This decision is influenced by the priority level assigned to each thread.\
  \ In macOS and Unix-like systems, this is handled using concepts like `nice`, `renice`, and Quality of Service (QoS) classes.\n\
  \n#### Nice and Renice\n\n1. **Nice:**\n   - The `nice` value of a process is a number that affects its priority. Every\
  \ process has a nice value ranging from -20 (the highest priority) to 19 (the lowest priority). The default nice value when\
  \ a process is created is typically 0.\n   - A lower nice value (closer to -20) makes a process more \"selfish,\" giving\
  \ it more CPU time compared to other processes with higher nice values.\n2. **Renice:**\n   - `renice` is a command used\
  \ to change the nice value of an already running process. This can be used to dynamically adjust the priority of processes,\
  \ either increasing or decreasing their CPU time allocation based on new nice values.\n   - For example, if a process needs\
  \ more CPU resources temporarily, you might lower its nice value using `renice`.\n\n#### Quality of Service (QoS) Classes\n\
  \nQoS classes are a more modern approach to handling thread priorities, particularly in systems like macOS that support\
  \ **Grand Central Dispatch (GCD)**. QoS classes allow developers to **categorize** work into different levels based on their\
  \ importance or urgency. macOS manages thread prioritization automatically based on these QoS classes:\n\n1. **User Interactive:**\n\
  \   - This class is for tasks that are currently interacting with the user or require immediate results to provide a good\
  \ user experience. These tasks are given the highest priority to keep the interface responsive (e.g., animations or event\
  \ handling).\n2. **User Initiated:**\n   - Tasks that the user initiates and expects immediate results, such as opening\
  \ a document or clicking a button that requires computations. These are high priority but below user interactive.\n3. **Utility:**\n\
  \   - These tasks are long-running and typically show a progress indicator (e.g., downloading files, importing data). They\
  \ are lower in priority than user-initiated tasks and do not need to finish immediately.\n4. **Background:**\n   - This\
  \ class is for tasks that operate in the background and are not visible to the user. These can be tasks like indexing, syncing,\
  \ or backups. They have the lowest priority and minimal impact on system performance.\n\nUsing QoS classes, developers do\
  \ not need to manage the exact priority numbers but rather focus on the nature of the task, and the system optimizes the\
  \ CPU resources accordingly.\n\nMoreover, there are different **thread scheduling policies** that flows to specify a set\
  \ of scheduling parameters that the scheduler will take into consideration. This can be done using `thread_policy_[set/get]`.\
  \ This might be useful in race condition attacks.\n\n## MacOS Process Abuse\n\nMacOS, like any other operating system, provides\
  \ a variety of methods and mechanisms for **processes to interact, communicate, and share data**. While these techniques\
  \ are essential for efficient system functioning, they can also be abused by threat actors to **perform malicious activities**.\n\
  \n### Library Injection\n\nLibrary Injection is a technique wherein an attacker **forces a process to load a malicious library**.\
  \ Once injected, the library runs in the context of the target process, providing the attacker with the same permissions\
  \ and access as the process.\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nmacos-library-injection/\n{{#endref}}\n\n### Function Hooking\n\nFunction Hooking\
  \ involves **intercepting function calls** or messages within a software code. By hooking functions, an attacker can **modify\
  \ the behavior** of a process, observe sensitive data, or even gain control over the execution flow.\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nmacos-function-hooking.md\n\
  {{#endref}}\n\n### Inter Process Communication\n\nInter Process Communication (IPC) refers to different methods by which\
  \ separate processes **share and exchange data**. While IPC is fundamental for many legitimate applications, it can also\
  \ be misused to subvert process isolation, leak sensitive information, or perform unauthorized actions.\n\n\n{{#ref}}\n\
  macos-ipc-inter-process-communication/\n{{#endref}}\n\n### Electron Applications Injection\n\nElectron applications executed\
  \ with specific env variables could be vulnerable to process injection:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nmacos-electron-applications-injection.md\n\
  {{#endref}}\n\n### Chromium Injection\n\nIt's possible to use the flags `--load-extension` and `--use-fake-ui-for-media-stream`\
  \ to perform a **man in the browser attack** allowing to steal keystrokes, traffic, cookies, inject scripts in pages...:\n\
  \n\n{{#ref}}\nmacos-chromium-injection.md\n{{#endref}}\n\n### Dirty NIB\n\nNIB files **define user interface (UI) elements**\
  \ and their interactions within an application. However, they can **execute arbitrary commands** and **Gatekeeper doesn't\
  \ stop** an already executed application from being executed if a **NIB file is modified**. Therefore, they could be used\
  \ to make arbitrary programs execute arbitrary commands:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nmacos-dirty-nib.md\n{{#endref}}\n\n### Java Applications\
  \ Injection\n\nIt's possible to abuse certain java capabilities (like the **`_JAVA_OPTS`** env variable) to make a java\
  \ application execute **arbitrary code/commands**.\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nmacos-java-apps-injection.md\n{{#endref}}\n\n### .Net\
  \ Applications Injection\n\nIt's possible to inject code into .Net applications by **abusing the .Net debugging functionality**\
  \ (not protected by macOS protections such as runtime hardening).\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nmacos-.net-applications-injection.md\n\
  {{#endref}}\n\n### Perl Injection\n\nCheck different options to make a Perl script execute arbitrary code in:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\n\
  macos-perl-applications-injection.md\n{{#endref}}\n\n### Ruby Injection\n\nI't also possible to abuse ruby env variables\
  \ to make arbitrary scripts execute arbitrary code:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nmacos-ruby-applications-injection.md\n{{#endref}}\n\n\
  ### Python Injection\n\nIf the environment variable **`PYTHONINSPECT`** is set, the python process will drop into a python\
  \ cli once it's finished. It's also possible to use **`PYTHONSTARTUP`** to indicate a python script to execute at the beginning\
  \ of an interactive session.\\\nHowever, note that **`PYTHONSTARTUP`** script won't be executed when **`PYTHONINSPECT`**\
  \ creates the interactive session.\n\nOther env variables such as **`PYTHONPATH`** and **`PYTHONHOME`** could also be useful\
  \ to make a python command execute arbitrary code.\n\nNote that executables compiled with **`pyinstaller`** won't use these\
  \ environmental variables even if they are running using an embedded python.\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n> Overall I couldn't find\
  \ a way to make python execute arbitrary code abusing environment variables.\\\n> However, most of the people install pyhton\
  \ using **Hombrew**, which will install pyhton in a **writable location** for the default admin user. You can hijack it\
  \ with something like:\n>\n> ```bash\n> mv /opt/homebrew/bin/python3 /opt/homebrew/bin/python3.old\n> cat > /opt/homebrew/bin/python3\
  \ <<EOF\n> #!/bin/bash\n> # Extra hijack code\n> /opt/homebrew/bin/python3.old \"$@\"\n> EOF\n> chmod +x /opt/homebrew/bin/python3\n\
  > ```\n>\n> Even **root** will run this code when running python.\n\n\n## Detection\n\n### Shield\n\n[**Shield**](https://theevilbit.github.io/shield/)\
  \ ([**Github**](https://github.com/theevilbit/Shield)) is an open source application that can **detect and block process\
  \ injection** actions:\n\n- Using **Environmental Variables**: It will monitor the presence of any of the following environmental\
  \ variables: **`DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES`**, **`CFNETWORK_LIBRARY_PATH`**, **`RAWCAMERA_BUNDLE_PATH`** and **`ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE`**\n\
  - Using **`task_for_pid`** calls: To find when one process wants to get the **task port of another** which allows to inject\
  \ code in the process.\n- **Electron apps params**: Someone can use **`--inspect`**, **`--inspect-brk`** and **`--remote-debugging-port`**\
  \ command line argument to start an Electron app in debugging mode, and thus inject code to it.\n- Using **symlinks** or\
  \ **hardlinks**: Typically the most common abuse is to **place a link with our user privileges**, and **point it to a higher\
  \ privilege** location. The detection is very simple for both hardlink and symlinks. If the process creating the link has\
  \ a **different privilege level** than the target file, we create an **alert**. Unfortunately in the case of symlinks blocking\
  \ is not possible, as we don’t have information about the destination of the link prior creation. This is a limitation of\
  \ Apple’s EndpointSecuriy framework.\n\n### Calls made by other processes\n\nIn [**this blog post**](https://knight.sc/reverse%20engineering/2019/04/15/detecting-task-modifications.html)\
  \ you can find how it's possible to use the function **`task_name_for_pid`** to get information about other **processes\
  \ injecting code in a process** and then getting information about that other process.\n\nNote that to call that function\
  \ you need to be **the same uid** as the one running the process or **root** (and it returns info about the process, not\
  \ a way to inject code).\n\n## References\n\n- [https://theevilbit.github.io/shield/](https://theevilbit.github.io/shield/)\n\
