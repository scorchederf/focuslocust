  \ Similar Endpoints\n\nAttempts should be made to perform brute force attacks on variations of the targeted endpoint, such\
  \ as `/api/v3/sign-up`, including alternatives like `/Sing-up`, `/SignUp`, `/singup`, `/api/v1/sign-up`, `/api/sign-up`\
  \ etc.\n\n### Incorporating Blank Characters in Code or Parameters\n\nInserting blank bytes like `%00`, `%0d%0a`, `%0d`,\
  \ `%0a`, `%09`, `%0C`, `%20` into code or parameters can be a useful strategy. For example, adjusting a parameter to `code=1234%0a`\
  \ allows for extending attempts through variations in input, like adding newline characters to an email address to get around\
  \ attempt limitations.\n\n### Manipulating IP Origin via Headers\n\nModifying headers to alter the perceived IP origin can\
  \ help evade IP-based rate limiting. Headers such as `X-Originating-IP`, `X-Forwarded-For`, `X-Remote-IP`, `X-Remote-Addr`,\
  \ `X-Client-IP`, `X-Host`, `X-Forwared-Host`, including using multiple instances of `X-Forwarded-For`, can be adjusted to\
  \ simulate requests from different IPs.\n\n```bash\nX-Originating-IP: 127.0.0.1\nX-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1\nX-Remote-IP:\
  \ 127.0.0.1\nX-Remote-Addr: 127.0.0.1\nX-Client-IP: 127.0.0.1\nX-Host: 127.0.0.1\nX-Forwared-Host: 127.0.0.1\n\n# Double\
  \ X-Forwarded-For header example\nX-Forwarded-For:\nX-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1\n```\n\n### Changing Other Headers\n\nAltering\
  \ other request headers such as the user-agent and cookies is recommended, as these can also be used to identify and track\
  \ request patterns. Changing these headers can prevent recognition and tracking of the requester's activities.\n\n### Leveraging\
  \ API Gateway Behavior\n\nSome API gateways are configured to apply rate limiting based on the combination of endpoint and\
  \ parameters. By varying the parameter values or adding non-significant parameters to the request, it's possible to circumvent\
  \ the gateway's rate-limiting logic, making each request appear unique. For exmple `/resetpwd?someparam=1`.\n\n### Logging\
  \ into Your Account Before Each Attempt\n\nLogging into an account before each attempt, or every set of attempts, might\
  \ reset the rate limit counter. This is especially useful when testing login functionalities. Utilizing a Pitchfork attack\
  \ in tools like Burp Suite, to rotate credentials every few attempts and ensuring follow redirects are marked, can effectively\
  \ restart rate limit counters.\n\n### Utilizing Proxy Networks\n\nDeploying a network of proxies to distribute the requests\
  \ across multiple IP addresses can effectively bypass IP-based rate limits. By routing traffic through various proxies,\
  \ each request appears to originate from a different source, diluting the rate limit's effectiveness.\n\n### Splitting the\
  \ Attack Across Different Accounts or Sessions\n\nIf the target system applies rate limits on a per-account or per-session\
  \ basis, distributing the attack or test across multiple accounts or sessions can help in avoiding detection. This approach\
  \ requires managing multiple identities or session tokens, but can effectively distribute the load to stay within allowable\
  \ limits.\n\n### Keep Trying\n\nNote that even if a rate limit is in place you should try to see if the response is different\
  \ when the valid OTP is sent. In [**this post**](https://mokhansec.medium.com/the-2-200-ato-most-bug-hunters-overlooked-by-closing-intruder-too-soon-505f21d56732),\
  \ the bug hunter discovered that even if a rate limit is triggered after 20 unsuccessful attempts by responding with 401,\
  \ if the valid one was sent a 200 response was received.\n\n---\n\n### Abusing HTTP/2 multiplexing & request pipelining\
  \ (2023-2025)\n\nModern rate–limiter implementations frequently count **TCP connections** (or even individual HTTP/1.1 requests)\
  \ instead of the *number of HTTP/2 streams* a connection contains. When the same TLS connection is reused, an attacker can\
  \ open hundreds of parallel streams, each carrying a separate request, while the gateway only deducts *one* request from\
  \ the quota.\n\n```bash\n# Send 100 POST requests in a single HTTP/2 connection with curl\nseq 1 100 | xargs -I@ -P0 curl\
  \ -k --http2-prior-knowledge -X POST \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\"code\":\"@\"}' https://target/api/v2/verify\
  \ &>/dev/null\n```\n\nIf the limiter protects only `/verify` but not `/api/v2/verify`, you can also combine **path confusion**\
  \ with HTTP/2 multiplexing for *extremely* high-speed OTP or credential brute-forcing.\n\n> \U0001F43E  **Tip:** PortSwigger’s\
  \ [Turbo Intruder](https://portswigger.net/research/turbo-intruder) supports HTTP/2 and lets you fine-tune `maxConcurrentConnections`\
  \ and `requestsPerConnection` to automate this attack.\n\n### GraphQL aliases & batched operations\n\nGraphQL allows the\
  \ client to send **several logically independent queries or mutations in a single request** by prefixing them with *aliases*.\
  \ Because the server executes every alias but the rate-limiter often counts only *one* request, this is a reliable bypass\
  \ for login or password-reset throttling.\n\n```graphql\nmutation bruteForceOTP {\n  a: verify(code:\"111111\") { token\
  \ }\n  b: verify(code:\"222222\") { token }\n  c: verify(code:\"333333\") { token }\n  # … add up to dozens of aliases …\n\
  }\n```\n\nLook at the response: exactly one alias will return 200 OK when the correct code is hit, while the others are\
  \ rate-limited.\n\nThe technique was popularised by PortSwigger’s research on “GraphQL batching & aliases” in 2023 and has\
  \ been responsible for many recent bug-bounty payouts.\n\n### Abuse of *batch* or *bulk* REST endpoints\n\nSome APIs expose\
  \ helper endpoints such as `/v2/batch` or accept an **array of objects** in the request body. If the limiter is placed in\
  \ front of the *legacy* endpoints only, wrapping multiple operations inside a single bulk request may completely sidestep\
  \ the protection.\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"path\": \"/login\", \"method\": \"POST\", \"body\": {\"user\":\"bob\",\"pass\":\"\
  123\"}},\n  {\"path\": \"/login\", \"method\": \"POST\", \"body\": {\"user\":\"bob\",\"pass\":\"456\"}}\n]\n```\n\n### Timing\
  \ the sliding-window\n\nA classic token-bucket or leaky-bucket limiter *resets* on a fixed time boundary (for example, every\
  \ minute). If the window is known (e.g. via error messages such as `X-RateLimit-Reset: 27`), fire the maximum allowed number\
  \ of requests **just before** the bucket resets, then immediately fire another full burst.\n\n```\n|<-- 60 s window ‑->|<--\
  \ 60 s window ‑->|\n       ######                 ######\n```\n\nThis simple optimisation can more than double your throughput\
  \ without touching any other bypass technique.\n\n### Upgrading to WebSockets / gRPC streaming after the handshake\n\nMany\
  \ edge rate-limiters only inspect the **initial HTTP request**. Once the connection is upgraded to WebSocket (HTTP 101)\
  \ or gRPC bidirectional streaming, subsequent messages often bypass request-per-second counters because they are no longer\
  \ separate HTTP requests. Cloudflare’s own docs note that only the initial upgrade request is subject to WAF/rate-limiting\
  \ rules; frames sent afterwards are opaque.\n\nPractical workflow:\n\n```bash\n# Flood 1,000 OTP guesses through a single\
  \ WebSocket connection\nseq -w 000000 000999 | websocat -n ws://target.tld/api/verify-ws\n\n# gRPC streaming: send multiple\
  \ Verify requests in one stream\ngrpcurl -d @ -plaintext target.tld:50051 service.VerifyOTP/Stream <<'EOF'\n{ \"code\":\
  \ \"111111\" }\n{ \"code\": \"222222\" }\n{ \"code\": \"333333\" }\nEOF\n```\n\nIf the login/OTP endpoint exposes both HTTP\
  \ and WebSocket/gRPC variants, establish the upgraded channel first and then spray codes within that single connection to\
  \ evade per-request throttles.\n\n### Exploiting CDN PoP‑sharded counters\n\nSome CDNs shard rate-limit counters **per data\
  \ center/PoP instead of globally**. Cloudflare explicitly states counters are not shared across data centers. By routing\
  \ requests through egress nodes in many regions (residential proxy pools, anycast VPNs, or cloud VMs pinned to different\
  \ continents), you multiply the allowed throughput: every PoP maintains an independent bucket for the same key.\n\nQuick\
  \ and dirty layout using open proxies (example with `proxychains` + a country‑rotating list):\n\n```bash\nfor p in $(cat\
  \ proxies.txt); do\n  HTTPS_PROXY=$p curl -s -X POST https://target/api/login -d @payload.json &\ndone\nwait\n```\n\nMake\
  \ sure the limiter key is not per-account; otherwise also rotate user IDs / session tokens.\n\n---\n\n## Tools\n\n- [**https://github.com/Hashtag-AMIN/hashtag-fuzz**](https://github.com/Hashtag-AMIN/hashtag-fuzz):\
  \ Fuzzing tool that supports header randomisation, chunked word-lists and round-robin proxy rotation.\n- [**https://github.com/ustayready/fireprox**](https://github.com/ustayready/fireprox):\
  \ Automatically creates disposable AWS API Gateway endpoints so every request originates from a different IP address – perfect\
  \ for defeating IP-based throttling.\n- **Burp Suite – IPRotate + extension**: Uses a pool of SOCKS/HTTP proxies (or AWS\
  \ API Gateway) to rotate the source IP transparently during *Intruder* and *Turbo Intruder* attacks.\n- **Turbo Intruder\
  \ (BApp)**: High-performance attack engine supporting HTTP/2 multiplexing; tune `requestsPerConnection` to 100-1000 to collapse\
  \ hundreds of requests into a single connection.\n\n## References\n\n- [PortSwigger Research – “Bypassing rate limits with\
