_body: "# Unlink Attack\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n## Basic Information\n\nWhen this attack was\
  \ discovered it mostly allowed a WWW (Write What Where), however, some **checks were added** making the new version of the\
  \ attack more interesting more more complex and **useless**.\n\n### Code Example:\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Code</summary>\n\
  \n```c\n#include <unistd.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <string.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n// Altered from https://github.com/DhavalKapil/heap-exploitation/tree/d778318b6a14edad18b20421f5a06fa1a6e6920e/assets/files/unlink_exploit.c\
  \ to make it work\n\nstruct chunk_structure {\n  size_t prev_size;\n  size_t size;\n  struct chunk_structure *fd;\n  struct\
  \ chunk_structure *bk;\n  char buf[10];               // padding\n};\n\nint main() {\n  unsigned long long *chunk1, *chunk2;\n\
  \  struct chunk_structure *fake_chunk, *chunk2_hdr;\n  char data[20];\n\n  // First grab two chunks (non fast)\n  chunk1\
  \ = malloc(0x8000);\n  chunk2 = malloc(0x8000);\n  printf(\"Stack pointer to chunk1: %p\\n\", &chunk1);\n  printf(\"Chunk1:\
  \ %p\\n\", chunk1);\n  printf(\"Chunk2: %p\\n\", chunk2);\n\n  // Assuming attacker has control over chunk1's contents\n\
  \  // Overflow the heap, override chunk2's header\n\n  // First forge a fake chunk starting at chunk1\n  // Need to setup\
  \ fd and bk pointers to pass the unlink security check\n  fake_chunk = (struct chunk_structure *)chunk1;\n  fake_chunk->size\
  \ = 0x8000;\n  fake_chunk->fd = (struct chunk_structure *)(&chunk1 - 3); // Ensures P->fd->bk == P\n  fake_chunk->bk = (struct\
  \ chunk_structure *)(&chunk1 - 2); // Ensures P->bk->fd == P\n\n  // Next modify the header of chunk2 to pass all security\
  \ checks\n  chunk2_hdr = (struct chunk_structure *)(chunk2 - 2);\n  chunk2_hdr->prev_size = 0x8000;  // chunk1's data region\
  \ size\n  chunk2_hdr->size &= ~1;        // Unsetting prev_in_use bit\n\n  // Now, when chunk2 is freed, attacker's fake\
  \ chunk is 'unlinked'\n  // This results in chunk1 pointer pointing to chunk1 - 3\n  // i.e. chunk1[3] now contains chunk1\
  \ itself.\n  // We then make chunk1 point to some victim's data\n  free(chunk2);\n  printf(\"Chunk1: %p\\n\", chunk1);\n\
  \  printf(\"Chunk1[3]: %x\\n\", chunk1[3]);\n\n  chunk1[3] = (unsigned long long)data;\n\n  strcpy(data, \"Victim's data\"\
  );\n\n  // Overwrite victim's data using chunk1\n  chunk1[0] = 0x002164656b636168LL;\n\n  printf(\"%s\\n\", data);\n\n \
  \ return 0;\n}\n\n```\n\n</details>\n\n- Attack doesn't work if tcaches are used (after 2.26)\n\n### Goal\n\nThis attack\
  \ allows to **change a pointer to a chunk to point 3 addresses before of itself**. If this new location (surroundings of\
  \ where the pointer was located) has interesting stuff, like other controllable allocations / stack..., it's possible to\
  \ read/overwrite them to cause a bigger harm.\n\n- If this pointer was located in the stack, because it's now pointing 3\
  \ address before itself and the user potentially can read it and modify it, it will be possible to leak sensitive info from\
  \ the stack or even modify the return address (maybe) without touching the canary\n- In order CTF examples, this pointer\
  \ is located in an array of pointers to other allocations, therefore, making it point 3 address before and being able to\
  \ read and write it, it's possible to make the other pointers point to other addresses.\\\n  As potentially the user can\
  \ read/write also the other allocations, he can leak information or overwrite new address in arbitrary locations (like in\
  \ the GOT).\n\n### Requirements\n\n- Some control in a memory (e.g. stack) to create a couple of chunks giving values to\
  \ some of the attributes.\n- Stack leak in order to set the pointers of the fake chunk.\n\n### Attack\n\n- There are a couple\
  \ of chunks (chunk1 and chunk2)\n- The attacker controls the content of chunk1 and the headers of chunk2.\n- In chunk1 the\
  \ attacker creates the structure of a fake chunk:\n  - To bypass protections he makes sure that the field `size` is correct\
  \ to avoid the error: `corrupted size vs. prev_size while consolidating`\n  - and fields `fd` and `bk` of the fake chunk\
  \ are pointing to where chunk1 pointer is stored in the with offsets of -3 and -2 respectively so `fake_chunk->fd->bk` and\
  \ `fake_chunk->bk->fd` points to position in memory (stack) where the real chunk1 address is located:\n\n<figure><img src=\"\
  ../../images/image (1245).png\" alt=\"\"><figcaption><p><a href=\"https://heap-exploitation.dhavalkapil.com/attacks/unlink_exploit\"\
  >https://heap-exploitation.dhavalkapil.com/attacks/unlink_exploit</a></p></figcaption></figure>\n\n- The headers of the\
  \ chunk2 are modified to indicate that the previous chunk is not used and that the size is the size of the fake chunk contained.\n\
  - When the second chunk is freed then this fake chunk is unlinked happening:\n  - `fake_chunk->fd->bk` = `fake_chunk->bk`\n\
  \  - `fake_chunk->bk->fd` = `fake_chunk->fd`\n- Previously it was made that `fake_chunk->fd->bk` and `fake_chunk->bk->fd`\
  \ point to the same place (the location in the stack where `chunk1` was stored, so it was a valid linked list). As **both\
  \ are pointing to the same location** only the last one (`fake_chunk->bk->fd = fake_chunk->fd`) will take **effect**.\n\
  - This will **overwrite the pointer to chunk1 in the stack to the address (or bytes) stored 3 addresses before in the stack**.\n\
  \  - Therefore, if an attacker could control the content of the chunk1 again, he will be able to **write inside the stack**\
  \ being able to potentially overwrite the return address skipping the canary and modify the values and points of local variables.\
  \ Even modifying again the address of chunk1 stored in the stack to a different location where if the attacker could control\
  \ again the content of chunk1 he will be able to write anywhere.\n  - Note that this was possible because the **addresses\
  \ are stored in the stack**. The risk and exploitation might depend on **where are the addresses to the fake chunk being\
  \ stored**.\n\n<figure><img src=\"../../images/image (1246).png\" alt=\"\"><figcaption><p><a href=\"https://heap-exploitation.dhavalkapil.com/attacks/unlink_exploit\"\

  - Although it would be weird to find an unlink attack even in a CTF here you have some writeups where this attack was used:\n\
  \  - CTF example: [https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/30-unlink/hitcon14_stkof/index.html](https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/30-unlink/hitcon14_stkof/index.html)\n\
  \    - In this example, instead of the stack there is an array of malloc'ed addresses. The unlink attack is performed to\
  \ be able to allocate a chunk here, therefore being able to control the pointers of the array of malloc'ed addresses. Then,\
  \ there is another functionality that allows to modify the content of chunks in these addresses, which allows to point addresses\
  \ to the GOT, modify function addresses to egt leaks and RCE.\n  - Another CTF example: [https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/30-unlink/zctf16_note2/index.html](https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/30-unlink/zctf16_note2/index.html)\n\
  \    - Just like in the previous example, there is an array of addresses of allocations. It's possible to perform an unlink\
  \ attack to make the address to the first allocation point a few possitions before starting the array and the overwrite\
  \ this allocation in the new position. Therefore, it's possible to overwrite pointers of other allocations to point to GOT\
  \ of atoi, print it to get a libc leak, and then overwrite atoi GOT with the address to a one gadget.\n  - CTF example with\
  \ custom malloc and free functions that abuse a vuln very similar to the unlink attack: [https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/33-custom_misc_heap/csaw17_minesweeper/index.html](https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/33-custom_misc_heap/csaw17_minesweeper/index.html)\n\
  \    - There is an overflow that allows to control the FD and BK pointers of custom malloc that will be (custom) freed.\
  \ Moreover, the heap has the exec bit, so it's possible to leak a heap address and point a function from the GOT to a heap\
  \ chunk with a shellcode to execute.\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}"
