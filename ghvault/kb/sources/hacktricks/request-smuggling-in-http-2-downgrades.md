_body: "# Request Smuggling in HTTP/2 Downgrades\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\nHTTP/2 is generally\
  \ considered immune to classic request-smuggling because the length of each DATA frame is explicit. **That protection disappears\
  \ as soon as a front-end proxy “downgrades” the request to HTTP/1.x before forwarding it to a back-end**. The moment two\
  \ different parsers (the HTTP/2 front-end and the HTTP/1 back-end) try to agree on where one request ends and the next begins,\
  \ all the old desync tricks come back – plus a few new ones.\n\n---\n## Why downgrades happen\n\n1. Browsers already speak\
  \ HTTP/2, but much legacy origin infrastructure still only understands HTTP/1.1.\n2. Reverse-proxies (CDNs, WAFs, load-balancers)\
  \ therefore terminate TLS + HTTP/2 at the edge and **rewrite every request as HTTP/1.1** for the origin.\n3. The translation\
  \ step has to create *both* `Content-Length` **and/or** `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` headers so that the origin can determine\
  \ body length.\n\nWhenever the front-end trusts the HTTP/2 frame length **but** the back-end trusts CL or TE, an attacker\
  \ can force them to disagree.\n\n---\n## Two dominant primitive classes\n\n| Variant | Front-end length | Back-end length\
  \ | Typical payload |\n|---------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| **H2.TE** | HTTP/2 frame | `Transfer-Encoding:\
  \ chunked` | Embed an extra chunked message body whose final `0\\r\\n\\r\\n` is *not* sent, so the back-end waits for the\
  \ attacker-supplied “next” request. |\n| **H2.CL** | HTTP/2 frame | `Content-Length` | Send a *smaller* CL than the real\
  \ body, so the back-end reads past the boundary into the following request. |\n\n> These are identical in spirit to classic\
  \ TE.CL / CL.TE, just with HTTP/2 replacing one of the parsers.  \n\n---\n## Identifying a downgrade chain\n\n1. Use **ALPN**\
  \ in a TLS handshake (`openssl s_client -alpn h2 -connect host:443`) or **curl**:\n   ```bash\n   curl -v --http2 https://target\n\
  \   ```\n   If `* Using HTTP2` appears, the edge speaks H2.\n2. Send a deliberately malformed CL/TE request *over* HTTP/2\
  \ (Burp Repeater now has a dropdown to force HTTP/2). If the response is an HTTP/1.1 error such as `400 Bad chunk`, you\
  \ have proof the edge converted the traffic for a HTTP/1 parser downstream.\n\n---\n## Exploitation workflow (H2.TE example)\n\
  \n```http\n:method: POST\n:path: /login\n:scheme: https\n:authority: example.com\ncontent-length: 13      # ignored by the\
  \ edge\ntransfer-encoding: chunked\n\n5;ext=1\\r\\nHELLO\\r\\n\n0\\r\\n\\r\\nGET /admin HTTP/1.1\\r\\nHost: internal\\r\\\
  nX: X\n```\n1. The **front-end** reads exactly 13 bytes (`HELLO\\r\\n0\\r\\n\\r\\nGE`), thinks the request is finished and\
  \ forwards that much to the origin.\n2. The **back-end** trusts the TE header, keeps reading until it sees the *second*\
  \ `0\\r\\n\\r\\n`, thereby consuming the prefix of the attacker’s second request (`GET /admin …`).\n3. The remainder (`GET\
  \ /admin …`) is treated as a *new* request queued behind the victim’s.\n\nReplace the smuggled request with:\n* `POST /api/logout`\
  \ to force session fixation\n* `GET /users/1234` to steal a victim-specific resource\n\n---\n## h2c smuggling (clear-text\
  \ upgrades)\n\nA 2023 study showed that if a front-end passes the HTTP/1.1 `Upgrade: h2c` header to a back-end that supports\
  \ clear-text HTTP/2, an attacker can tunnel *raw* HTTP/2 frames through an edge that only validated HTTP/1.1. This bypasses\
  \ header normalisation, WAF rules and even TLS termination.  \n\nKey requirements:\n* Edge forwards **both** `Connection:\
  \ Upgrade` and `Upgrade: h2c` unchanged.\n* Origin increments to HTTP/2 and keeps the connection-reuse semantics that enable\
  \ request queueing.\n\nMitigation is simple – strip or hard-code the `Upgrade` header at the edge except for WebSockets.\n\
  \n---\n## Notable real-world CVEs (2022-2025)\n\n* **CVE-2023-25690** – Apache HTTP Server mod_proxy rewrite rules could\
  \ be chained for request splitting and smuggling. (fixed in 2.4.56)  \n* **CVE-2023-25950** – HAProxy 2.7/2.6 request/response\
  \ smuggling when HTX parser mishandled pipelined requests.  \n* **CVE-2022-41721** – Go `MaxBytesHandler` caused left-over\
  \ body bytes to be parsed as **HTTP/2** frames, enabling cross-protocol smuggling.  \n\n---\n## Tooling\n\n* **Burp Request\
  \ Smuggler** – since v1.26 it automatically tests H2.TE/H2.CL and hidden ALPN support. Enable “HTTP/2 probing” in the extension\
  \ options.\n* **h2cSmuggler** – Python PoC by Bishop Fox to automate the clear-text upgrade attack:\n  ```bash\n  python3\
  \ h2csmuggler.py -u https://target -x 'GET /admin HTTP/1.1\\r\\nHost: target\\r\\n\\r\\n'\n  ```\n* **curl**/`hyper` – crafting\
  \ manual payloads: `curl --http2-prior-knowledge -X POST --data-binary @payload.raw https://target`.\n\n---\n## Defensive\
  \ measures\n\n1. **End-to-end HTTP/2** – eliminate the downgrade translation completely.\n2. **Single source of length truth**\
  \ – when downgrading, *always* generate a valid `Content-Length` **and** **strip** any user-supplied `Content-Length`/`Transfer-Encoding`\
  \ headers.\n3. **Normalize before route** – apply header-sanitisation *before* routing/rewrite logic.\n4. **Connection isolation**\
  \ – do not reuse back-end TCP connections across users; “one request per connection” defeats queue-based exploits.\n5. **Strip\
  \ `Upgrade` unless WebSocket** – prevents h2c tunnelling.\n\n---\n## References\n\n* PortSwigger Research – “HTTP/2: The\
