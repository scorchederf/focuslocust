_body: "# Cache Poisoning via URL discrepancies\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\nThis is a summary\
  \ of the techniques proposed in the post [https://portswigger.net/research/gotta-cache-em-all](https://portswigger.net/research/gotta-cache-em-all)\
  \ in order to perform cache poisoning attacks **abusing discrepancies between cache proxies and web servers.**\n\n> [!TIP]\n\
  > The goal of this attack is to **make the cache server think that a static resource is being loaded** so it caches it while\
  \ the cache server stores as cache key part of the path but the web server responds resolving another path. The web server\
  \ will resolve the real path which will be loading a dynamic page (which might store sensitive information about the user,\
  \ a malicious payload like XSS or redirecting to lo load a JS file from the attackers website for example).\n\n## Delimiters\n\
  \n**URL delimiters** vary by framework and server, impacting how requests are routed and responses are handled. Some common\
  \ origin delimiters are:\n\n- **Semicolon**: Used in Spring for matrix variables (e.g. `/hello;var=a/world;var1=b;var2=c`\
  \ → `/hello/world`).\n- **Dot**: Specifies response format in Ruby on Rails (e.g. `/MyAccount.css` → `/MyAccount`)\n- **Null\
  \ Byte**: Truncates paths in OpenLiteSpeed (e.g. `/MyAccount%00aaa` → `/MyAccount`).\n- **Newline Byte**: Separates URL\
  \ components in Nginx (e.g. `/users/MyAccount%0aaaa` → `/account/MyAccount`).\n\nOther specific delimiters might be found\
  \ following this process:\n\n- **Step 1**: Identify non-cacheable requests and use them to monitor how URLs with potential\
  \ delimiters are handled.\n- **Step 2**: Append random suffixes to paths and compare the server's response to determine\
  \ if a character functions as a delimiter.\n- **Step 3**: Introduce potential delimiters before the random suffix to see\
  \ if the response changes, indicating delimiter usage.\n\n## Normalization & Encodings\n\n- **Purpose**: URL parsers in\
  \ both cache and origin servers normalize URLs to extract paths for endpoint mapping and cache keys.\n- **Process**: Identifies\
  \ path delimiters, extracts and normalizes the path by decoding characters and removing dot-segments.\n\n### **Encodings**\n\
  \nDifferent HTTP servers and proxies like Nginx, Node, and CloudFront decode delimiters differently, leading to inconsistencies\
  \ across CDNs and origin servers that could be exploited. For example, if the web server perform this transformation `/myAccount%3Fparam`\
  \ → `/myAccount?param` but the cache server keeps as key the path `/myAccount%3Fparam`, there is an inconsistency.\n\nA\
  \ way to check for these inconsistencies is to send requests URL encoding different chars after loading the path without\
  \ any encoding and check if the encoded path response came from the cached response.\n\n### Dot segment\n\nThe path normalization\
  \ where dots are involved is also very interesting for cache poisoning attacks. For example, `/static/../home/index` or\
  \ `/aaa..\\home/index`, some cache servers will cache these paths with themselves ad the keys while other might resolve\
  \ the path and use `/home/index` as the cache key.\\\nJust like before, sending these kind of requests and checking if the\
  \ response was gathered from the cache helps to identify if the response to `/home/index` is the response sent when those\
  \ paths are requested.\n\n## Static Resources\n\nSeveral cache servers will always cache a response if it's identified as\
  \ static. This might be because:\n\n- **The extension**: Cloudflare will always cache files with the following extensions:\
  \ 7z, csv, gif, midi, png, tif, zip, avi, doc, gz, mkv, ppt, tiff, zst, avif, docx, ico, mp3, pptx, ttf, apk, dmg, iso,\
  \ mp4, ps, webm, bin, ejs, jar, ogg, rar, webp, bmp, eot, jpg, otf, svg, woff, bz2, eps, jpeg, pdf, svgz, woff2, class,\
  \ exe, js, pict, swf, xls, css, flac, mid, pls, tar, xlsx\n  - It's possible to force a cache storing a dynamic response\
  \ by using a delimiter and a static extension like a request to `/home$image.png` will cache `/home$image.png` and the origin\
  \ server will respond with `/home`\n- **Well-known static directories**: The following directories contains static files\
  \ and therefore their response should be cached: /static, /assets, /wp-content, /media, /templates, /public, /shared\n \
  \ - It's possible to force a cache storing a dynamic response by using a delimiter, a static directory and dots like: `/home/..%2fstatic/something`\
  \ will cache `/static/something` and the response will be`/home`\n  - **Static dirs + dots**: A request to `/static/..%2Fhome`\
  \ or to `/static/..%5Chome` might be cached as is but the response might be `/home`\n- **Static files:** Some specific files\
  \ are always cached like `/robots.txt`, `/favicon.ico`, and `/index.html`. Which can be abused like `/home/..%2Frobots.txt`\
  \ where the cace might store `/robots.txt` and the origin server respond to `/home`.\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}"
