  \n[Example from bierbaumer.net](https://bierbaumer.net/security/php-lfi-with-nginx-assistance/) showed that even the following\
  \ one-liner is enough when PHP runs behind an nginx reverse proxy that buffers request bodies to disk:\n\n```php\n<?php\n\
  $action = $_GET['action'] ?? 'read';\n$path   = $_GET['file'] ?? 'index.php';\n$action === 'read' ? readfile($path) : include\
  \ $path;\n```\n\nThe nginx side typically keeps default temp paths such as `/var/lib/nginx/body` and `/var/lib/nginx/fastcgi`.\
  \ When a request body or upstream response is larger than the in-memory buffer (≈8 KB by default), nginx transparently writes\
  \ the data to a temp file, keeps the file descriptor open, and only unlinks the file name. Any PHP `include` that follows\
  \ symbolic links (like `/proc/<pid>/fd/<fd>`) can still execute the unlinked contents, giving you RCE through LFI.\n\n##\
  \ Why nginx temp files are abusable\n\n* Request bodies that exceed the buffer threshold are flushed to `client_body_temp_path`\
  \ (defaults to `/tmp/nginx/client-body` or `/var/lib/nginx/body`).\n* The file name is random, but the file descriptor remains\
  \ reachable under `/proc/<nginx_pid>/fd/<fd>`. As long as the request body has not completed (or you keep the TCP stream\
  \ hanging), nginx keeps the descriptor open even though the path entry is unlinked.\n* PHP’s include/require resolves those\
  \ `/proc/.../fd/...` symlinks, so an attacker with LFI can hop through procfs to execute the buffered temp file even after\
  \ nginx deletes it.\n\n## Classic exploitation workflow (recap)\n\n1. **Enumerate worker PIDs.** Fetch `/proc/<pid>/cmdline`\
  \ over the LFI until you find strings like `nginx: worker process`. The number of workers rarely exceeds the CPU count,\
  \ so you only have to scan the lower PID space.\n2. **Force nginx to create the temp file.** Send very large POST/PUT bodies\
  \ (or proxied responses) so that nginx spills to `/var/lib/nginx/body/XXXXXXXX`. Make sure the backend never reads the entire\
  \ body—e.g., keep-alive the upload thread so nginx keeps the descriptor open.\n3. **Map descriptors to files.** With the\
  \ PID list, generate traversal chains such as `/proc/<pidA>/cwd/proc/<pidB>/root/proc/<pidC>/fd/<fd>` to bypass any `realpath()`\
  \ normalization before PHP resolves the final `/proc/<victim_pid>/fd/<interesting_fd>` target. Brute-forcing file descriptors\
  \ 10–45 is usually enough because nginx reuses that range for body temp files.\n4. **Include for execution.** When you hit\
  \ the descriptor that still points to the buffered body, a single `include` or `require` call runs your payload—even though\
  \ the original filename has already been unlinked. If you only need file read, switch to `readfile()` to exfiltrate the\
  \ temporary contents instead of executing them.\n\n## Modern variations (2024–2025)\n\nIngress controllers and service meshes\
  \ now routinely expose nginx instances with additional attack surface. CVE-2025-1974 (\"IngressNightmare\") is a good example\
  \ of how the classic temp-file trick evolves:\n\n* Attackers push a malicious shared object as a request body. Because the\
  \ body is >8 KB, nginx buffers it to `/tmp/nginx/client-body/cfg-<random>`. By intentionally lying in the `Content-Length`\
  \ header (e.g., claiming 1 MB and never sending the last chunk) the temp file remains pinned for ~60 seconds.\n* The vulnerable\
  \ ingress-nginx template code allowed injecting directives into the generated nginx config. Combining that with the lingering\
  \ temp file made it possible to brute-force `/proc/<pid>/fd/<fd>` links until the attacker discovered the buffered shared\
  \ object.\n* Injecting `ssl_engine /proc/<pid>/fd/<fd>;` forced nginx to load the buffered `.so`. Constructors inside the\
  \ shared object yielded immediate RCE inside the ingress controller pod, which in turn exposed Kubernetes secrets.\n\nA\
  \ trimmed-down reconnaissance snippet for this style of attack looks like:\n\n<details>\n<summary>Quick procfs scanner</summary>\n\
  \n```python\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport os\n\ndef find_tempfds(pid_range=range(100, 4000), fd_range=range(10, 80)):\n\
  \    for pid in pid_range:\n        fd_dir = f\"/proc/{pid}/fd\"\n        if not os.path.isdir(fd_dir):\n            continue\n\
  \        for fd in fd_range:\n            try:\n                path = os.readlink(f\"{fd_dir}/{fd}\")\n               \
  \ if \"client-body\" in path or \"nginx\" in path:\n                    yield pid, fd, path\n            except OSError:\n\
  \                continue\n\nfor pid, fd, path in find_tempfds():\n    print(f\"use ?file=/proc/{pid}/fd/{fd}  # {path}\"\
  )\n```\n\n</details>\n\nRun it from any primitive (command injection, template injection, etc.) you already have. Feed the\
  \ discovered `/proc/<pid>/fd/<fd>` paths back into your LFI parameter to include the buffered payload.\n\n## Practical tips\n\
  \n* When nginx disables buffering (`proxy_request_buffering off`, `client_body_buffer_size` tuned high, or `proxy_max_temp_file_size\
  \ 0`), the technique becomes much harder—so always enumerate config files and response headers to check whether buffering\
  \ is still enabled.\n* Hanging uploads are noisy but effective. Use multiple processes to flood workers so that at least\
  \ one temp file stays around long enough for your LFI brute force to catch it.\n* In Kubernetes or other orchestrators,\
  \ privilege boundaries may look different, but the primitive is the same: find a way to drop bytes into nginx buffers, then\
  \ walk `/proc` from anywhere you can issue file system reads.\n\n## Labs\n\n- [https://bierbaumer.net/security/php-lfi-with-nginx-assistance/php-lfi-with-nginx-assistance.tar.xz](https://bierbaumer.net/security/php-lfi-with-nginx-assistance/php-lfi-with-nginx-assistance.tar.xz)\n\
