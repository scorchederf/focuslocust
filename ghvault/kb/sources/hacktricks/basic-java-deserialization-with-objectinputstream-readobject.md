  \nIn this POST it's going to be explained an example using `java.io.Serializable` **and why overriding `readObject()` can\
  \ be extremely dangerous if the incoming stream is attacker-controlled**.\n\n## Serializable\n\nThe Java `Serializable`\
  \ interface (`java.io.Serializable`) is a marker interface your classes must implement if they are to be **serialized**\
  \ and **deserialized**. Java object serialization (writing) is done with the [`ObjectOutputStream`](http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-io/objectoutputstream.html)\
  \ and deserialization (reading) is done with the [`ObjectInputStream`](http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-io/objectinputstream.html).\n\
  \n### Reminder: Which methods are implicitly invoked during deserialization?\n\n1. `readObject()` – class-specific read\
  \ logic (if implemented and *private*).\n2. `readResolve()` – can replace the deserialized object with another one.\n3.\
  \ `validateObject()` – via `ObjectInputValidation` callbacks.\n4. `readExternal()` – for classes implementing `Externalizable`.\n\
  5. Constructors are **not** executed – therefore gadget chains rely exclusively on the previous callbacks.\n\nAny method\
  \ in that chain that ends up invoking attacker-controlled data (command execution, JNDI lookups, reflection, etc.) turns\
  \ the deserialization routine into an RCE gadget.\n\nLets see an example with a **class Person** which is **serializable**.\
  \ This class **overwrites the readObject** function, so when **any object** of this **class** is **deserialized** this **function**\
  \ is going to be **executed**.\\\nIn the example, the **readObject** function of the class Person calls the function `eat()`\
  \ of his pet and the function `eat()` of a Dog (for some reason) calls a **calc.exe**. **We are going to see how to serialize\
  \ and deserialize a Person object to execute this calculator:**\n\n**The following example is from <https://medium.com/@knownsec404team/java-deserialization-tool-gadgetinspector-first-glimpse-74e99e493649>**\n\
  \n```java\nimport java.io.Serializable;\nimport java.io.*;\n\npublic class TestDeserialization {\n    interface Animal {\n\
  \        public void eat();\n    }\n    //Class must implements Serializable to be serializable\n    public static class\
  \ Cat implements Animal,Serializable {\n        @Override\n        public void eat() {\n            System.out.println(\"\
  cat eat fish\");\n        }\n    }\n    //Class must implements Serializable to be serializable\n    public static class\
  \ Dog implements Animal,Serializable {\n        @Override\n        public void eat() {\n            try {\n            \
  \    Runtime.getRuntime().exec(\"calc\");\n            } catch (IOException e) {\n                e.printStackTrace();\n\
  \            }\n            System.out.println(\"dog eat bone\");\n        }\n    }\n    //Class must implements Serializable\
  \ to be serializable\n    public static class Person implements Serializable {\n        private Animal pet;\n        public\
  \ Person(Animal pet){\n            this.pet = pet;\n        }\n        //readObject implementation, will call the readObject\
  \ from ObjectInputStream  and then call pet.eat()\n        private void readObject(java.io.ObjectInputStream stream)\n \
  \               throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException {\n            pet = (Animal) stream.readObject();\n        \
  \    pet.eat();\n        }\n    }\n    public static void GeneratePayload(Object instance, String file)\n            throws\
  \ Exception {\n        //Serialize the constructed payload and write it to the file\n        File f = new File(file);\n\
  \        ObjectOutputStream out = new ObjectOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(f));\n        out.writeObject(instance);\n\
  \        out.flush();\n        out.close();\n    }\n    public static void payloadTest(String file) throws Exception {\n\
  \        //Read the written payload and deserialize it\n        ObjectInputStream in = new ObjectInputStream(new FileInputStream(file));\n\
  \        Object obj = in.readObject();\n        System.out.println(obj);\n        in.close();\n    }\n    public static\
  \ void main(String[] args) throws Exception {\n        // Example to call Person with a Dog\n        Animal animal = new\
  \ Dog();\n        Person person = new Person(animal);\n        GeneratePayload(person,\"test.ser\");\n        payloadTest(\"\
  test.ser\");\n        // Example to call Person with a Cat\n        //Animal animal = new Cat();\n        //Person person\
  \ = new Person(animal);\n        //GeneratePayload(person,\"test.ser\");\n        //payloadTest(\"test.ser\");\n    }\n\
  }\n```\n\n### Conclusion (classic scenario)\n\nAs you can see in this very basic example, the “vulnerability” here appears\
  \ because the **readObject()** method is **calling other attacker-controlled code**. In real-world gadget chains, thousands\
  \ of classes contained in external libraries (Commons-Collections, Spring, Groovy, Rome, SnakeYAML, etc.) can be abused\
  \ – the attacker only needs *one* reachable gadget to get code execution.\n\n---\n\n## 2023-2025: What changed in real-world\
  \ Java deserialization bugs?\n\nRecent cases are a good reminder that `ObjectInputStream` bugs are no longer just “upload\
  \ a `.ser` file to a legacy HTTP endpoint”:\n\n* **Broker / queue consumers**: Spring-Kafka (`CVE-2023-34040`) showed that\
  \ deserializing exception headers from attacker-controlled topics is enough if the consumer enables the unusual `checkDeserExWhen*`\
  \ flags.\n* **Client-side trust of remote servers**: the Aerospike Java client (`CVE-2023-36480`) deserialized objects received\
  \ from the server. The vendor response was notable: newer clients removed Java runtime serialization/deserialization support\
  \ instead of trying to preserve it behind a weak filter.\n* **“Restricted” streams are often still too broad**: `pac4j-core`\
  \ (`CVE-2023-25581`) tried to protect deserialization with `RestrictedObjectInputStream`, but the accepted class set was\
  \ still large enough to make gadget abuse possible.\n\nThe offensive lesson is that the dangerous trust boundary is often\
  \ **not** “user uploads a blob”, but “some component the developer considered trusted can inject bytes into a stream that\
  \ eventually reaches `readObject()`”.\n\nIf you need low-noise reachability checks before spending time on full gadget research,\
  \ use the dedicated Java pages for:\n\n{{#ref}}\njava-dns-deserialization-and-gadgetprobe.md\n{{#endref}}\n\n## `readObject()`\
  \ anti-patterns that still create gadget entrypoints\n\nEven if your class itself is not an obvious RCE gadget, the following\
  \ patterns are enough to make it exploitable when attacker-controlled objects are embedded in the graph:\n\n1. Calling overridable\
  \ methods or interface methods from `readObject()` (`pet.eat()` in the PoC above is the classic example).\n2. Performing\
  \ lookups, reflection, class loading, expression evaluation, or JNDI operations during deserialization.\n3. Iterating over\
  \ attacker-controlled collections or maps, which may trigger `hashCode()`, `equals()`, comparators, or transformers as side\
  \ effects.\n4. Registering `ObjectInputValidation` callbacks that perform dangerous post-processing.\n5. Assuming “private\
  \ `readObject()`” is enough protection. It only controls dispatch semantics; it does **not** make deserialization safe.\n\
  \n## Modern mitigations you should deploy\n\n1. **JEP 290 / Serialization Filtering (Java 9+)**  \n   Use an allow-list\
  \ and explicit graph limits:\n   ```bash\n   -Djdk.serialFilter=\"com.example.dto.*;java.base/*;maxdepth=5;maxrefs=1000;maxbytes=16384;!*\"\
  \n   ```\n2. **Apply a filter on every untrusted stream, not just globally**:\n   ```java\n   try (var ois = new ObjectInputStream(input))\
  \ {\n       var filter = ObjectInputFilter.Config.createFilter(\n           \"com.example.dto.*;java.base/*;maxdepth=5;maxrefs=1000;!*\"\
  \n       );\n       ois.setObjectInputFilter(filter);\n       return (Message) ois.readObject();\n   }\n   ```\n3. **JEP\
  \ 415 (Java 17+) Context-Specific Filter Factories**  \n   Prefer this when the same JVM has multiple deserialization contexts\
  \ (RMI, cache replication, message consumers, admin-only imports) and each one needs a different allow-list.\n4. **Keep\
  \ `readObject()` boring**  \n   Only call `defaultReadObject()` / explicit field reads, then perform strict invariant checks.\
  \ Do not do I/O, logging that dereferences attacker-controlled objects, dynamic lookups, or method calls on deserialized\
  \ sub-objects.\n5. **If possible, remove Java native serialization from the design**  \n   The Aerospike fix is a good model:\
  \ when the feature is not essential, deleting `readObject()` / `writeObject()` usage is often safer than trying to maintain\
  \ perfect filters forever.\n\n## Detection and research workflow\n\n* `ysoserial` remains the baseline for gadget validation\
  \ and quick RCE/URLDNS probes.\n* `marshalsec` is still useful when the sink pivots into JNDI/LDAP/RMI territory.\n* `GadgetInspector`\
  \ is useful when you have the target jars and need to look for application-specific gadget chains.\n* Java 17 added the\
  \ `jdk.Deserialization` Flight Recorder event, which is useful for seeing where `ObjectInputStream` is actually used and\
  \ whether filters are being applied.\n\n## Quick checklist for secure `readObject()` implementations\n\n1. Make the method\
  \ `private` and annotate serialization hooks with `@Serial` so compilers can catch mis-declared signatures.\n2. Call `defaultReadObject()`\
  \ first unless you have a strong reason to manually read the full object graph.\n3. Treat every nested object as attacker-controlled\
  \ until validated.\n4. Never invoke methods on deserialized collaborators from inside `readObject()`.\n5. Pair the code\
  \ review with an `ObjectInputFilter` review; “safe-looking `readObject()` code” is not enough if the stream still accepts\
  \ arbitrary classes.\n\n## References\n\n- [OpenJDK JEP 415: Context-Specific Deserialization Filters](https://openjdk.org/jeps/415)\n\
