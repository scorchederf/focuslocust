  \nConfigure a global HTTP proxy so all apps route traffic through your interceptor (Burp/mitmproxy):\n\n```bash\n# Set proxy\
  \ (device/emulator must reach your host IP)\nadb shell settings put global http_proxy 192.168.1.2:8080\n\n# Clear proxy\n\
  adb shell settings put global http_proxy :0\n```\n\nTip: In Burp, bind your listener to 0.0.0.0 so devices on the LAN can\
  \ connect (Proxy -> Options -> Proxy Listeners).\n\n## On a Virtual Machine\n\nFirst of all you need to download the Der\
  \ certificate from Burp. You can do this in _**Proxy**_ --> _**Options**_ --> _**Import / Export CA certificate**_\n\n![](<../../images/image\
  \ (367).png>)\n\n**Export the certificate in Der format** and lets **transform** it to a form that **Android** is going\
  \ to be able to **understand.** Note that **in order to configure the burp certificate on the Android machine in AVD** you\
  \ need to **run** this machine **with** the **`-writable-system`** option.\\\nFor example you can run it like:\n\n```bash\n\
  C:\\Users\\<UserName>\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\Sdk\\tools\\emulator.exe -avd \"AVD9\" -http-proxy 192.168.1.12:8080 -writable-system\n\
  ```\n\nThen, to **configure burps certificate do**:\n\n```bash\nopenssl x509 -inform DER -in burp_cacert.der -out burp_cacert.pem\n\
  CERTHASHNAME=\"`openssl x509 -inform PEM -subject_hash_old -in burp_cacert.pem | head -1`.0\"\nmv burp_cacert.pem $CERTHASHNAME\
  \ #Correct name\nadb root && sleep 2 && adb remount #Allow to write on /syste\nadb push $CERTHASHNAME /sdcard/ #Upload certificate\n\
  adb shell mv /sdcard/$CERTHASHNAME /system/etc/security/cacerts/ #Move to correct location\nadb shell chmod 644 /system/etc/security/cacerts/$CERTHASHNAME\
  \ #Assign privileges\nadb reboot #Now, reboot the machine\n```\n\nOnce the **machine finish rebooting** the burp certificate\
  \ will be in use by it!\n\n## Using Magisk\n\nIf you **rooted your device with Magisk** (maybe an emulator), and you **can't\
  \ follow** the previous **steps** to install the Burp cert because the **filesystem is read-only** and you cannot remount\
  \ it writable, there is another way.\n\nExplained in [**this video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQicUW0svB8) you need\
  \ to:\n\n1. **Install a CA certificate**: Just **drag&drop** the DER Burp certificate **changing the extension** to `.crt`\
  \ in the mobile so it's stored in the Downloads folder and go to `Install a certificate` -> `CA certificate`\n\n<figure><img\
  \ src=\"../../images/image (53).png\" alt=\"\" width=\"164\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n- Check that the certificate\
  \ was correctly stored going to `Trusted credentials` -> `USER`\n\n<figure><img src=\"../../images/image (54).png\" alt=\"\
  \" width=\"334\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n2. **Make it System trusted**: Download the Magisk module [MagiskTrustUserCerts](https://github.com/NVISOsecurity/MagiskTrustUserCerts)\
  \ (a .zip file), **drag&drop it** in the phone, go to the **Magisk app** in the phone to the **`Modules`** section, click\
  \ on **`Install from storage`**, select the `.zip` module and once installed **reboot** the phone:\n\n<figure><img src=\"\
  ../../images/image (55).png\" alt=\"\" width=\"345\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n- After rebooting, go to `Trusted\
  \ credentials` -> `SYSTEM` and check the Postswigger cert is there\n\n<figure><img src=\"../../images/image (56).png\" alt=\"\
  \" width=\"314\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n### Alternative: AlwaysTrustUserCerts (Android 7-16 Beta)\n\nIf you're\
  \ on Android 14+ (or on older devices that received Conscrypt Mainline updates and now use `/apex/com.android.conscrypt/cacerts`),\
  \ the Magisk module **AlwaysTrustUserCerts** automates the bind-mounting required for system trust. It mirrors user CAs\
  \ into system trust and injects mounts into Zygote/app namespaces so apps see the certs without manual `nsenter` work.\n\
  \n1. Install the Burp CA as a **user** cert first.\n2. Install the module and reboot.\n3. If the module offers a choice,\
  \ prefer `--rbind` when mounting `/system/etc/security/cacerts` into `/apex/com.android.conscrypt/cacerts` to ensure nested\
  \ mounts (from other modules) are visible.\n\n### Learn how to create a Magisk module\n\nCheck [https://medium.com/@justmobilesec/magisk-for-mobile-pentesting-rooting-android-devices-and-building-custom-modules-part-ii-22badc498437](https://medium.com/@justmobilesec/magisk-for-mobile-pentesting-rooting-android-devices-and-building-custom-modules-part-ii-22badc498437)\n\
  \n## Post Android 14\n\nIn the latest Android 14 release, a significant shift has been observed in the handling of system-trusted\
  \ Certificate Authority (CA) certificates.\n\nNote: Some Android 12/13 devices that received **Conscrypt Mainline** updates\
  \ already use `/apex/com.android.conscrypt/cacerts`. If that directory exists on your device, you must use the same APEX\
  \ injection technique described below.\n\nPreviously, these certificates were housed in **`/system/etc/security/cacerts/`**,\
  \ accessible and modifiable by users with root privileges, which allowed immediate application across the system. However,\
  \ with Android 14, the storage location has been moved to **`/apex/com.android.conscrypt/cacerts`**, a directory within\
  \ the **`/apex`** path, which is immutable by nature.\n\nAttempts to remount the **APEX cacerts path** as writable are met\
  \ with failure, as the system does not allow such operations. Even attempts to unmount or overlay the directory with a temporary\
  \ file system (tmpfs) do not circumvent the immutability; applications continue to access the original certificate data\
  \ regardless of changes at the file system level. This resilience is due to the **`/apex`** mount being configured with\
  \ PRIVATE propagation, ensuring that any modifications within the **`/apex`** directory do not affect other processes.\n\
  \nThe initialization of Android involves the `init` process, which, upon starting the operating system, also initiates the\
  \ Zygote process. This process is responsible for launching application processes with a new mount namespace that includes\
  \ a private **`/apex`** mount, thus isolating changes to this directory from other processes.\n\nNevertheless, a workaround\
  \ exists for those needing to modify the system-trusted CA certificates within the **`/apex`** directory. This involves\
  \ manually remounting **`/apex`** to remove the PRIVATE propagation, thereby making it writable. The process includes copying\
  \ the contents of **`/apex/com.android.conscrypt`** to another location, unmounting the **`/apex/com.android.conscrypt`**\
  \ directory to eliminate the read-only constraint, and then restoring the contents to their original location within **`/apex`**.\
  \ This approach requires swift action to avoid system crashes. To ensure system-wide application of these changes, it is\
  \ recommended to restart the `system_server`, which effectively restarts all applications and brings the system to a consistent\
  \ state.\n\n```bash\n# Create a separate temp directory, to hold the current certificates\n# Otherwise, when we add the\
  \ mount we can't read the current certs anymore.\nmkdir -p -m 700 /data/local/tmp/tmp-ca-copy\n\n# Copy out the existing\
  \ certificates\ncp /apex/com.android.conscrypt/cacerts/* /data/local/tmp/tmp-ca-copy/\n\n# Create the in-memory mount on\
  \ top of the system certs folder\nmount -t tmpfs tmpfs /system/etc/security/cacerts\n\n# Copy the existing certs back into\
  \ the tmpfs, so we keep trusting them\nmv /data/local/tmp/tmp-ca-copy/* /system/etc/security/cacerts/\n\n# Copy our new\
  \ cert in, so we trust that too\nmv $CERTIFICATE_PATH /system/etc/security/cacerts/\n\n# Update the perms & selinux context\
  \ labels\nchown root:root /system/etc/security/cacerts/*\nchmod 644 /system/etc/security/cacerts/*\nchcon u:object_r:system_file:s0\
  \ /system/etc/security/cacerts/*\n\n# Deal with the APEX overrides, which need injecting into each namespace:\n\n# First\
  \ we get the Zygote process(es), which launch each app\nZYGOTE_PID=$(pidof zygote || true)\nZYGOTE64_PID=$(pidof zygote64\
  \ || true)\n# N.b. some devices appear to have both!\n\n# Apps inherit the Zygote's mounts at startup, so we inject here\
  \ to ensure\n# all newly started apps will see these certs straight away:\nfor Z_PID in \"$ZYGOTE_PID\" \"$ZYGOTE64_PID\"\
  ; do\n    if [ -n \"$Z_PID\" ]; then\n        nsenter --mount=/proc/$Z_PID/ns/mnt -- \\\n            /bin/mount --bind /system/etc/security/cacerts\
  \ /apex/com.android.conscrypt/cacerts\n    fi\ndone\n\n# Then we inject the mount into all already running apps, so they\n\
  # too see these CA certs immediately:\n\n# Get the PID of every process whose parent is one of the Zygotes:\nAPP_PIDS=$(\n\
  \    echo \"$ZYGOTE_PID $ZYGOTE64_PID\" | \\\n    xargs -n1 ps -o 'PID' -P | \\\n    grep -v PID\n)\n\n# Inject into the\
  \ mount namespace of each of those apps:\nfor PID in $APP_PIDS; do\n    nsenter --mount=/proc/$PID/ns/mnt -- \\\n      \
  \  /bin/mount --bind /system/etc/security/cacerts /apex/com.android.conscrypt/cacerts &\ndone\nwait # Launched in parallel\
  \ - wait for completion here\n\necho \"System certificate injected\"\n```\n\n### Bind-mounting through NSEnter\n\n1. **Setting\
  \ Up a Writable Directory**: Initially, a writable directory is established by mounting a `tmpfs` over the existing non-APEX\
  \ system certificate directory. This is achieved with the following command:\n\n```bash\n    mount -t tmpfs tmpfs /system/etc/security/cacerts\n\
  ```\n\n2. **Preparing CA Certificates**: Following the setup of the writable directory, the CA certificates that one intends\
  \ to use should be copied into this directory. This might involve copying the default certificates from `/apex/com.android.conscrypt/cacerts/`.\
  \ It's essential to adjust the permissions and SELinux labels of these certificates accordingly.\n3. **Bind Mounting for\
  \ Zygote**: Utilizing `nsenter`, one enters the Zygote's mount namespace. Zygote, being the process responsible for launching\
  \ Android applications, requires this step to ensure that all applications initiated henceforth utilize the newly configured\
  \ CA certificates. The command used is:\n\nTip: If `/system/etc/security/cacerts` contains nested mounts (common with Magisk\
  \ modules), use `--rbind` instead of `--bind` so those mounts propagate into app namespaces.\n\n```bash\nnsenter --mount=/proc/$ZYGOTE_PID/ns/mnt\
  \ -- /bin/mount --bind /system/etc/security/cacerts /apex/com.android.conscrypt/cacerts\n# If /system/etc/security/cacerts\
  \ includes nested mounts, prefer --rbind\nnsenter --mount=/proc/$ZYGOTE_PID/ns/mnt -- /bin/mount --rbind /system/etc/security/cacerts\
  \ /apex/com.android.conscrypt/cacerts\n```\n\nThis ensures that every new app started will adhere to the updated CA certificates\
  \ setup.\n\n4. **Applying Changes to Running Apps**: To apply the changes to already running applications, `nsenter` is\
  \ again used to enter each app's namespace individually and perform a similar bind mount. The necessary command is:\n\n\
  ```bash\nnsenter --mount=/proc/$APP_PID/ns/mnt -- /bin/mount --bind /system/etc/security/cacerts /apex/com.android.conscrypt/cacerts\n\
  ```\n\n5. **Alternative Approach - Soft Reboot**: An alternative method involves performing the bind mount on the `init`\
  \ process (PID 1) followed by a soft reboot of the operating system with `stop && start` commands. This approach would propagate\
  \ the changes across all namespaces, avoiding the need to individually address each running app. However, this method is\
  \ generally less preferred due to the inconvenience of rebooting.\n\n## References\n\n- [Android 14: Install a system CA\
