## Preserved Source Material

````yaml
_body: "# macOS Files, Folders, Binaries & Memory\n\n{{#include ../../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n## File hierarchy\
  \ layout\n\n- **/Applications**: The installed apps should be here. All the users will be able to access them.\n- **/bin**:\
  \ Command line binaries\n- **/cores**: If exists, it's used to store core dumps\n- **/dev**: Everything is treated as a\
  \ file so you may see hardware devices stored here.\n- **/etc**: Configuration files\n- **/Library**: A lot of subdirectories\
  \ and files related to preferences, caches and logs can be found here. A Library folder exists in root and on each user's\
  \ directory.\n- **/private**: Undocumented but a lot of the mentioned folders are symbolic links to the private directory.\n\
  - **/sbin**: Essential system binaries (related to administration)\n- **/System**: File fo making OS X run. You should find\
  \ mostly only Apple specific files here (not third party).\n- **/tmp**: Files are deleted after 3 days (it's a soft link\
  \ to /private/tmp)\n- **/Users**: Home directory for users.\n- **/usr**: Config and system binaries\n- **/var**: Log files\n\
  - **/Volumes**: The mounted drives will apear here.\n- **/.vol**: Running `stat a.txt` you obtain something like `16777223\
  \ 7545753 -rw-r--r-- 1 username wheel ...` where the first number is the id number of the volume where the file exists and\
  \ the second one is the inode number. You can access the content of this file through /.vol/ with that information running\
  \ `cat /.vol/16777223/7545753`\n\n### Applications Folders\n\n- **System applications** are located under `/System/Applications`\n\
  - **Installed** applications are usually installed in `/Applications` or in `~/Applications`\n- **Application data** can\
  \ be found in `/Library/Application Support` for the applications running as root and `~/Library/Application Support` for\
  \ applications running as the user.\n- Third-party applications **daemons** that **need to run as root** as usually located\
  \ in `/Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/`\n- **Sandboxed** apps are mapped into the `~/Library/Containers` folder. Each app\
  \ has a folder named according to the application’s bundle ID (`com.apple.Safari`).\n- The **kernel** is located in `/System/Library/Kernels/kernel`\n\
  - **Apple's kernel extensions** are located in `/System/Library/Extensions`\n- **Third-party kernel extensions** are stored\
  \ in `/Library/Extensions`\n\n### Files with Sensitive Information\n\nMacOS stores information such as passwords in several\
  \ places:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nmacos-sensitive-locations.md\n{{#endref}}\n\n### Vulnerable pkg installers\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nmacos-installers-abuse.md\n\
  {{#endref}}\n\n## OS X Specific Extensions\n\n- **`.dmg`**: Apple Disk Image files are very frequent for installers.\n-\
  \ **`.kext`**: It must follow a specific structure and it's the OS X version of a driver. (it's a bundle)\n- **`.plist`**:\
  \ Also known as property list stores information in XML or binary format.\n  - Can be XML or binary. Binary ones can be\
  \ read with:\n    - `defaults read config.plist`\n    - `/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c print config.plsit`\n    - `plutil -p\
  \ ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.screensaver.plist`\n    - `plutil -convert xml1 ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.screensaver.plist\
  \ -o -`\n    - `plutil -convert json ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.screensaver.plist -o -`\n- **`.app`**: Apple applications\
  \ that follows directory structure (It's a bundle).\n- **`.dylib`**: Dynamic libraries (like Windows DLL files)\n- **`.pkg`**:\
  \ Are the same as xar (eXtensible Archive format). The installer command can be use to install the contents of these files.\n\
  - **`.DS_Store`**: This file is on each directory, it saves the attributes and customisations of the directory.\n- **`.Spotlight-V100`**:\
  \ This folder appears on the root directory of every volume on the system.\n- **`.metadata_never_index`**: If this file\
  \ is at the root of a volume Spotlight won't index that volume.\n- **`.noindex`**: Files and folder with this extension\
  \ won't be indexed by Spotlight.\n- **`.sdef`**: Files inside bundles specifying how it's possible to interact wth the application\
  \ from an AppleScript.\n\n### macOS Bundles\n\nA bundle is a **directory** which **looks like an object in Finder** (a Bundle\
  \ example are `*.app` files).\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nmacos-bundles.md\n{{#endref}}\n\n## Dyld Shared Library Cache (SLC)\n\nOn macOS\
  \ (and iOS) all system shared libraries, like frameworks and dylibs, are **combined into a single file**, called the **dyld\
  \ shared cache**. This improved performance, since code can be loaded faster.\n\nThis is located in macOS in `/System/Volumes/Preboot/Cryptexes/OS/System/Library/dyld/`\
  \ and in older versions you might be able to find the **shared cache** in **`/System/Library/dyld/`**.\\\nIn iOS you can\
  \ find them in **`/System/Library/Caches/com.apple.dyld/`**.\n\nSimilar to the dyld shared cache, the kernel and the kernel\
  \ extensions are also compiled into a kernel cache, which is loaded at boot time.\n\nIn order to extract the libraries from\
  \ the single file dylib shared cache it was possible to use the binary [dyld_shared_cache_util](https://www.mbsplugins.de/files/dyld_shared_cache_util-dyld-733.8.zip)\
  \ which might not be working nowadays but you can also use [**dyldextractor**](https://github.com/arandomdev/dyldextractor):\n\
  \n```bash\n# dyld_shared_cache_util\ndyld_shared_cache_util -extract ~/shared_cache/ /System/Volumes/Preboot/Cryptexes/OS/System/Library/dyld/dyld_shared_cache_arm64e\n\
  \n# dyldextractor\ndyldex -l [dyld_shared_cache_path] # List libraries\ndyldex_all [dyld_shared_cache_path] # Extract all\n\
  # More options inside the readme\n```\n\n> [!TIP]\n> Note that even if `dyld_shared_cache_util` tool doesn't work, you can\
  \ pass the **shared dyld binary to Hopper** and Hopper will be able to identify all the libraries and let you **select which\
  \ one** you want to investigate:\n\n<figure><img src=\"../../../images/image (1152).png\" alt=\"\" width=\"563\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\
  \nSome extractors won't work as dylibs are prelinked with hard coded addresses in therefore they might be jumping to unknown\
  \ addresses\n\n> [!TIP]\n> It's also possible to download the Shared Library Cache of other \\*OS devices in macos by using\
  \ an emulator in Xcode. They will be downloaded inside: ls `$HOME/Library/Developer/Xcode/<*>OS\\ DeviceSupport/<version>/Symbols/System/Library/Caches/com.apple.dyld/`,\
  \ like:`$HOME/Library/Developer/Xcode/iOS\\ DeviceSupport/14.1\\ (18A8395)/Symbols/System/Library/Caches/com.apple.dyld/dyld_shared_cache_arm64`\n\
  \n### Mapping SLC\n\n**`dyld`** uses the syscall **`shared_region_check_np`** to know if the SLC has been mapped (which\
  \ returns the address) and **`shared_region_map_and_slide_np`** to map the SLC.\n\nNote that even if the SLC is slid on\
  \ the first use, all the **processes** use the **same copy**, which **eliminated the ASLR** protection if the attacker was\
  \ able to run processes in the system. This was actually exploited in the past and fixed with shared region pager.\n\nBranch\
  \ pools are little Mach-O dylibs that creates small spaces between image mappings making impossible to interpose the functions.\n\
  \n### Override SLCs\n\nUsing the the env variables:\n\n- **`DYLD_DHARED_REGION=private DYLD_SHARED_CACHE_DIR=</path/dir>\
  \ DYLD_SHARED_CACHE_DONT_VALIDATE=1`** -> This will allow to load a new shared library cache\n- **`DYLD_SHARED_CACHE_DIR=avoid`**\
  \ and manually replace the libraries with symlinks to the shared cache with the real ones (you will need to extract them)\n\
  \n## Special File Permissions\n\n### Folder permissions\n\nIn a **folder**, **read** allows to **list it**, **write** allows\
  \ to **delete** and **write** files on it, and **execute** allows to **traverse** the directory. So, for example, a user\
  \ with **read permission over a file** inside a directory where he **doesn't have execute** permission **won't be able to\
  \ read** the file.\n\n### Flag modifiers\n\nThere are some flags that could be set in the files that will make file behave\
  \ differently. You can **check the flags** of the files inside a directory with `ls -lO /path/directory`\n\n- **`uchg`**:\
  \ Known as **uchange** flag will **prevent any action** changing or deleting the **file**. To set it do: `chflags uchg file.txt`\n\
  \  - The root user could **remove the flag** and modify the file\n- **`restricted`**: This flag makes the file be **protected\
  \ by SIP** (you cannot add this flag to a file).\n- **`Sticky bit`**: If a directory with sticky bit, **only** the **directories\
  \ owner or root can remane or delete** files. Typically this is set on the /tmp directory to prevent ordinary users from\
  \ deleting or moving other users’ files.\n\nAll the flags can be found in the file `sys/stat.h` (find it using `mdfind stat.h\
  \ | grep stat.h`) and are:\n\n- `UF_SETTABLE` 0x0000ffff: Mask of owner changeable flags.\n- `UF_NODUMP` 0x00000001: Do\
  \ not dump file.\n- `UF_IMMUTABLE` 0x00000002: File may not be changed.\n- `UF_APPEND` 0x00000004: Writes to file may only\
  \ append.\n- `UF_OPAQUE` 0x00000008: Directory is opaque wrt. union.\n- `UF_COMPRESSED` 0x00000020: File is compressed (some\
  \ file-systems).\n- `UF_TRACKED` 0x00000040: No notifications for deletes/renames for files with this set.\n- `UF_DATAVAULT`\
  \ 0x00000080: Entitlement required for reading and writing.\n- `UF_HIDDEN` 0x00008000: Hint that this item should not be\
  \ displayed in a GUI.\n- `SF_SUPPORTED` 0x009f0000: Mask of superuser supported flags.\n- `SF_SETTABLE` 0x3fff0000: Mask\
  \ of superuser changeable flags.\n- `SF_SYNTHETIC` 0xc0000000: Mask of system read-only synthetic flags.\n- `SF_ARCHIVED`\
  \ 0x00010000: File is archived.\n- `SF_IMMUTABLE` 0x00020000: File may not be changed.\n- `SF_APPEND` 0x00040000: Writes\
  \ to file may only append.\n- `SF_RESTRICTED` 0x00080000: Entitlement required for writing.\n- `SF_NOUNLINK` 0x00100000:\
  \ Item may not be removed, renamed or mounted on.\n- `SF_FIRMLINK` 0x00800000: File is a firmlink.\n- `SF_DATALESS` 0x40000000:\
  \ File is dataless object.\n\n### **File ACLs**\n\nFile **ACLs** contain **ACE** (Access Control Entries) where more **granular\
  \ permissions** can be assigned to different users.\n\nIt's possible to grant a **directory** these permissions: `list`,\
  \ `search`, `add_file`, `add_subdirectory`, `delete_child`, `delete_child`.\\\nAns to a **file**: `read`, `write`, `append`,\
  \ `execute`.\n\nWhen the file contains ACLs you will **find a \"+\" when listing the permissions like in**:\n\n```bash\n\
  ls -ld Movies\ndrwx------+   7 username  staff     224 15 Apr 19:42 Movies\n```\n\nYou can **read the ACLs** of the file\
  \ with:\n\n```bash\nls -lde Movies\ndrwx------+ 7 username  staff  224 15 Apr 19:42 Movies\n 0: group:everyone deny delete\n\
  ```\n\nYou can find **all the files with ACLs** with (this is veeery slow):\n\n```bash\nls -RAle / 2>/dev/null | grep -E\
  \ -B1 \"\\d: \"\n```\n\n### Extended Attributes\n\nExtended attributes have a name and any desired value, and can be seen\
  \ using `ls -@` and manipulated using the `xattr` command. Some common extended attributes are:\n\n- `com.apple.resourceFork`:\
  \ Resource fork compatibility. Also visible as `filename/..namedfork/rsrc`\n- `com.apple.quarantine`: MacOS: Gatekeeper\
  \ quarantine mechanism (III/6)\n- `metadata:*`: MacOS: various metadata, such as `_backup_excludeItem`, or `kMD*`\n- `com.apple.lastuseddate`\
  \ (#PS): Last file use date\n- `com.apple.FinderInfo`: MacOS: Finder information (e.g., color Tags)\n- `com.apple.TextEncoding`:\
  \ Specifies text encoding of ASCII text files\n- `com.apple.logd.metadata`: Used by logd on files in `/var/db/diagnostics`\n\
  - `com.apple.genstore.*`: Generational storage (`/.DocumentRevisions-V100` in root of filesystem)\n- `com.apple.rootless`:\
  \ MacOS: Used by System Integrity Protection to label file (III/10)\n- `com.apple.uuidb.boot-uuid`: logd markings of boot\
  \ epochs with unique UUID\n- `com.apple.decmpfs`: MacOS: Transparent file compression (II/7)\n- `com.apple.cprotect`: \\\
  *OS: Per-file encryption data (III/11)\n- `com.apple.installd.*`: \\*OS: Metadata used by installd, e.g., `installType`,\
  \ `uniqueInstallID`\n\n### Resource Forks | macOS ADS\n\nThis is a way to obtain **Alternate Data Streams in MacOS** machines.\
  \ You can save content inside an extended attribute called **com.apple.ResourceFork** inside a file by saving it in **file/..namedfork/rsrc**.\n\
  \n```bash\necho \"Hello\" > a.txt\necho \"Hello Mac ADS\" > a.txt/..namedfork/rsrc\n\nxattr -l a.txt #Read extended attributes\n\
  com.apple.ResourceFork: Hello Mac ADS\n\nls -l a.txt #The file length is still q\n-rw-r--r--@ 1 username  wheel  6 17 Jul\
  \ 01:15 a.txt\n```\n\nYou can **find all the files containing this extended attribute** with:\n\n```bash\nfind / -type f\
  \ -exec ls -ld {} \\; 2>/dev/null | grep -E \"[x\\-]@ \" | awk '{printf $9; printf \"\\n\"}' | xargs -I {} xattr -lv {}\
  \ | grep \"com.apple.ResourceFork\"\n```\n\n### decmpfs\n\nThe extended attribute `com.apple.decmpfs` indicates that the\
  \ file is stored encrypted, `ls -l` will report a **size of 0** and the compressed data is inside this attribute. Whenever\
  \ the file is accessed it'll be decrypted in memory.\n\nThis attr can be seen with `ls -lO` indicated as compressed because\
  \ compressed files are also tagged with the flag `UF_COMPRESSED`. If a compressed file is removed this flag with `chflags\
  \ nocompressed </path/to/file>`, the system won't know that the file was compressed and therefore it won't be able to decompress\
  \ and access the data (it will think that it's actually empty).\n\nThe tool afscexpand can be used to force decompress a\
  \ file.\n\n\n### Interesting configuration locations (macOS)\n\n| Path / Location | Purpose / What it configures | Security\
  \ / Attack-Potential |\n|---|---|---|\n| `/System/Library/FeatureFlags/Domain/` | Stores Apple’s feature-flag plist files\
  \ controlling optional or experimental behaviors in system daemons / frameworks | If an attacker can bypass SIP or gain\
  \ privilege, tampering these could enable hidden code paths or disable safeguards |\n| `/System/Library/CoreServices/systemVersion.plist`\
  \ | Holds macOS version metadata (ProductVersion, BuildVersion) used by apps / installers to gate behavior | Modification\
  \ may trick apps or installers into accepting unsupported OS versions or unlocking features |\n| `/Library/Preferences/com.apple.*.plist`\
  \ & `~/Library/Preferences/*.plist` | Application / system-wide preferences | If writable, attackers can inject settings\
  \ to steer app behavior, disable protections, or cause misconfiguration |\n| `/Library/LaunchDaemons/` / `/Library/LaunchAgents/`\
  \ | Plist definitions for background daemons and agents | Malicious plist insertion or manipulation (if permissions allow)\
  \ enables persistence or privilege escalations |\n| `/etc/hosts` | Hostname ↔ IP mappings used by the system DNS resolver\
  \ | Redirecting domain names, intercepting traffic, spoofing services under local control |\n| `/etc/sudoers` | Defines\
  \ who can run commands with `sudo` and under what conditions | A corrupted sudoers file can grant root or improper privileges\
  \ to attacker accounts |\n| `/private/var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default/users/` | Local user account definition plists | Tampering\
  \ allows creation or modification of user accounts, password hashes, or user metadata |\n| `/System/Library/Extensions/`\
  \ / `/Library/Extensions/` | Kernel extensions / drivers | Installing or modifying kexts can lead to kernel-level control;\
  \ heavily protected by SIP / signature policies |\n| `/private/var/db/SystemPolicyConfiguration/` | Stores configuration\
  \ for system policy enforcement (e.g. Gatekeeper, notarization) | Tampering these may allow circumvention of policy checks\
  \ or trust rules |\n| `/usr/libexec/ssh-keysign`, `/etc/ssh/ssh_config`, `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` | SSH helper binaries and\
  \ config files | Misconfiguration leads to weak SSH security, unauthorized access, or insecure algorithms |\n| `/System/Library/Sandbox/Profiles`\
  \ | System sandbox profiles (SBPL) used to restrict process actions | Replacing or altering profiles can open sandbox escape\
  \ vectors or weaken containment |\n\n> **Note**: Many of these paths lie under SIP-protected directories (e.g. `/System`)\
  \ and are protected against writes unless SIP is disabled or bypassed.  \n\n\n## **Universal binaries &** Mach-o Format\n\
  \nMac OS binaries usually are compiled as **universal binaries**. A **universal binary** can **support multiple architectures\
  \ in the same file**.\n\n{{#ref}}\nuniversal-binaries-and-mach-o-format.md\n{{#endref}}\n\n\n## macOS memory dumping\n\n\
  {{#ref}}\nmacos-memory-dumping.md\n{{#endref}}\n\n## Risk Category Files Mac OS\n\nThe directory `/System/Library/CoreServices/CoreTypes.bundle/Contents/Resources/System`\
  \ is where information about the **risk associated with different file extensions is stored**. This directory categorizes\
  \ files into various risk levels, influencing how Safari handles these files upon download. The categories are as follows:\n\
  \n- **LSRiskCategorySafe**: Files in this category are considered **completely safe**. Safari will automatically open these\
  \ files after they are downloaded.\n- **LSRiskCategoryNeutral**: These files come with no warnings and are **not automatically\
  \ opened** by Safari.\n- **LSRiskCategoryUnsafeExecutable**: Files under this category **trigger a warning** indicating\
  \ that the file is an application. This serves as a security measure to alert the user.\n- **LSRiskCategoryMayContainUnsafeExecutable**:\
  \ This category is for files, such as archives, that might contain an executable. Safari will **trigger a warning** unless\
  \ it can verify that all contents are safe or neutral.\n\n## Log files\n\n- **`$HOME/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices.QuarantineEventsV2`**:\
  \ Contains information about downloaded files, like the URL from where they were downloaded.\n- **`/var/log/system.log`**:\
  \ Main log of OSX systems. com.apple.syslogd.plist is responsible for the execution of syslogging (you can check if it's\
  \ disabled looking for \"com.apple.syslogd\" in `launchctl list`.\n- **`/private/var/log/asl/*.asl`**: These are the Apple\
  \ System Logs which may contain interesting information.\n- **`$HOME/Library/Preferences/com.apple.recentitems.plist`**:\
  \ Stores recently accessed files and applications through \"Finder\".\n- **`$HOME/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginitems.plsit`**:\
  \ Stores items to launch upon system startup\n- **`$HOME/Library/Logs/DiskUtility.log`**: Log file for thee DiskUtility\
  \ App (info about drives, including USBs)\n- **`/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.airport.preferences.plist`**:\
  \ Data about wireless access points.\n- **`/private/var/db/launchd.db/com.apple.launchd/overrides.plist`**: List of daemons\
  \ deactivated.\n\n{{#include ../../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}"
