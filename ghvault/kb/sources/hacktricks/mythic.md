_body: "# Mythic\n\n{{#include ../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n## What is Mythic?\n\nMythic is an open-source, modular,\
  \ collaborative command and control (C2) framework designed for red teaming. It allows operators to manage and deploy agents\
  \ (payloads) across different operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and macOS. Mythic provides a browser UI for multi-operator\
  \ tasking, file handling, SOCKS/rpfwd management, and payload generation.\n\nUnlike monolithic frameworks, the Mythic repository\
  \ itself does **not** ship payload types or C2 profiles. Agents, wrappers, and C2 profiles are typically installed as external\
  \ components and can be updated independently from Mythic core.\n\n### Installation\n\nTo install Mythic, follow the instructions\
  \ on the official **[Mythic repo](https://github.com/its-a-feature/Mythic)**. A common bootstrap from the Mythic directory\
  \ is:\n\n```bash\nsudo make\nsudo ./mythic-cli start\n```\n\nIf Mythic is already running, you can normally add a new agent\
  \ or profile with `./mythic-cli install github ...` and then either restart Mythic or just start the new component directly.\n\
  \n### Agents\n\nMythic supports multiple agents, which are the **payloads that perform tasks on the compromised systems**.\
  \ Each agent can be tailored to specific needs and can run on different operating systems.\n\nBy default Mythic doesn't\
  \ have any agents installed. The open-source community agents live in [**https://github.com/MythicAgents**](https://github.com/MythicAgents),\
  \ and the [**community feature matrix**](https://mythicmeta.github.io/overview/agent_matrix.html) is useful to quickly check\
  \ supported operating systems, payload formats, wrappers, and C2 profiles.\n\nTo install an agent from that org you can\
  \ run:\n\n```bash\nsudo ./mythic-cli install github https://github.com/MythicAgents/<agent-name>\nsudo ./mythic-cli install\
  \ github https://github.com/MythicAgents/Apollo.git\nsudo -E ./mythic-cli install github https://github.com/MythicAgents/Apollo.git\n\
  ```\n\nThe `sudo -E` form is useful when you are installing from a non-root environment. You can add new agents with the\
  \ previous command even if Mythic is already running.\n\n### C2 Profiles\n\nC2 profiles in Mythic define **how agents communicate\
  \ with the Mythic server**. They specify the communication protocol, encryption methods, and other settings. You can create\
  \ and manage C2 profiles through the Mythic web interface.\n\nBy default Mythic is installed with no profiles, however,\
  \ it's possible to download some profiles from the repo [**https://github.com/MythicC2Profiles**](https://github.com/MythicC2Profiles)\
  \ running:\n\n```bash\nsudo ./mythic-cli install github https://github.com/MythicC2Profiles/<c2-profile>\nsudo ./mythic-cli\
  \ install github https://github.com/MythicC2Profiles/http\n```\n\nCurrent operator-relevant profiles to keep in mind:\n\n\
  - [`http`](https://github.com/MythicC2Profiles/http): basic asynchronous GET/POST traffic.\n- [`httpx`](https://github.com/MythicC2Profiles/httpx):\
  \ more flexible HTTP traffic with multiple callback domains, fail-over/round-robin rotation, custom headers/query parameters,\
  \ and message transforms (`base64`, `base64url`, `xor`, `netbios`, `prepend`, `append`) placed in cookies, headers, query\
  \ parameters, or body.\n- [`dynamichttp`](https://github.com/MythicC2Profiles/dynamichttp): JSON/TOML-driven HTTP message\
  \ shaping when the static `http` profile is too recognizable.\n\n### Wrapper payloads\n\nWrapper payloads let you keep the\
  \ same agent logic while changing the on-disk representation that gets delivered or persisted.\n\n- `service_wrapper`: turns\
  \ another payload into a Windows service executable, which is useful when the execution path requires a valid service binary.\n\
  - `scarecrow_wrapper`: wraps compatible shellcode with the ScareCrow loader to generate loader-backed outputs such as EXE/DLL/CPL.\n\
  \n## [Apollo Agent](https://github.com/MythicAgents/Apollo)\n\nApollo is a Windows agent written in C# using the 4.0 .NET\
  \ Framework designed to be used in SpecterOps training offerings.\n\nInstall it with:\n\n```bash\n./mythic-cli install github\
  \ https://github.com/MythicAgents/Apollo.git\n```\n\n### Current build/profile notes\n\n- Apollo can currently emit `WinExe`,\
  \ `Shellcode`, `Service`, and `Source` payloads.\n- The commonly used Apollo profiles are `http`, `httpx`, `smb`, `tcp`,\
  \ and `websocket`.\n- `httpx` is usually the more flexible option when you need domain rotation, proxy support, custom message\
  \ placement, and message transforms instead of the older static `http` profile.\n- Apollo supports wrapper payloads such\
  \ as `service_wrapper` and `scarecrow_wrapper`.\n- `register_file` and `register_assembly` are the staging primitives for\
  \ `execute_assembly`, `execute_pe`, `inline_assembly`, `execute_coff`, `powershell_import`, and `powerpick`. In current\
  \ Apollo builds, those staged artifacts are cached client-side as DPAPI-protected AES256 blobs.\n- `ls` and `ps` results\
  \ integrate especially well with Mythic's browser scripts and file/process browser, which makes operator triage noticeably\
  \ faster in collaborative operations.\n\nThis agent has a lot of commands that makes it very similar to Cobalt Strike's\
  \ Beacon with some extras. Among them, it supports:\n\n### Common actions\n\n- `cat`: Print the contents of a file\n- `cd`:\
  \ Change the current working directory\n- `cp`: Copy a file from one location to another\n- `ls`: List files and directories\
  \ in the current directory or specified path\n- `ifconfig`: Get network adapters and interfaces\n- `netstat`: Get TCP and\
  \ UDP connection information\n- `pwd`: Print the current working directory\n- `ps`: List running processes on the target\
  \ system (with added info)\n- `jobs`: List all running jobs associated with long-running tasking\n- `download`: Download\
  \ a file from the target system to the local machine\n- `upload`: Upload a file from the local machine to the target system\n\
  - `reg_query`: Query registry keys and values on the target system\n- `reg_write_value`: Write a new value to a specified\
  \ registry key\n- `sleep`: Change the agent's sleep interval, which determines how often it checks in with the Mythic server\n\
  - And many others, use `help` to see the full list of available commands.\n\n### Privilege escalation\n\n- `getprivs`: Enable\
  \ as many privileges as possible on the current thread token\n- `getsystem`: Open a handle to winlogon and duplicate the\
  \ token, effectively escalating privileges to SYSTEM level\n- `make_token`: Create a new logon session and apply it to the\
  \ agent, allowing for impersonation of another user\n- `steal_token`: Steal a primary token from another process, allowing\
  \ the agent to impersonate that process's user\n- `pth`: Pass-the-Hash attack, allowing the agent to authenticate as a user\
  \ using their NTLM hash without needing the plaintext password\n- `mimikatz`: Run Mimikatz commands to extract credentials,\
  \ hashes, and other sensitive information from memory or the SAM database\n- `rev2self`: Revert the agent's token to its\
  \ primary token, effectively dropping privileges back to the original level\n- `ppid`: Change the parent process for post-exploitation\
  \ jobs by specifying a new parent process ID, allowing for better control over job execution context\n- `printspoofer`:\
  \ Execute PrintSpoofer commands to bypass print spooler security measures, allowing for privilege escalation or code execution\n\
  - `dcsync`: Sync a user's Kerberos keys to the local machine, allowing for offline password cracking or further attacks\n\
  - `ticket_cache_add`: Add a Kerberos ticket to the current logon session or a specified one, allowing for ticket reuse or\
  \ impersonation\n\n### Process execution\n\n- `assembly_inject`: Allows to inject a .NET assembly loader into a remote process\n\
  - `blockdlls`: Block non-Microsoft signed DLLs from loading into post-exploitation jobs\n- `execute_assembly`: Executes\
  \ a .NET assembly in the context of the agent\n- `execute_coff`: Executes a COFF file in memory, allowing for in-memory\
  \ execution of compiled code\n- `execute_pe`: Executes an unmanaged executable (PE)\n- `get_injection_techniques`: Show\
  \ available injection techniques and the currently selected one\n- `inline_assembly`: Executes a .NET assembly in a disposable\
  \ AppDomain, allowing for temporary execution of code without affecting the agent's main process\n- `register_assembly`:\
  \ Register a .NET assembly for later execution\n- `register_file`: Register a file in the agent cache for later `execute_*`\
  \ or PowerShell tasking\n- `run`: Executes a binary on the target system, using the system's PATH to find the executable\n\
  - `set_injection_technique`: Change the injection primitive used by post-exploitation jobs\n- `shinject`: Injects shellcode\
  \ into a remote process, allowing for in-memory execution of arbitrary code\n- `inject`: Injects agent shellcode into a\
  \ remote process, allowing for in-memory execution of the agent's code\n- `spawn`: Spawns a new agent session in the specified\
  \ executable, allowing for the execution of shellcode in a new process\n- `spawnto_x64` and `spawnto_x86`: Change the default\
  \ binary used in post-exploitation jobs to a specified path instead of using `rundll32.exe` without params which is very\
  \ noisy.\n\n### Mythic Forge\n\nThis allows to **load COFF/BOF** files from the Mythic Forge, which is a repository of pre-compiled\
  \ payloads and tools that can be executed on the target system. With all the commands that can be loaded it'll be possible\
  \ to perform common actions executing them in the current agent process as BOFs (usually with better OPSEC than spawning\
  \ a separate process).\n\nStart installing them with:\n\n```bash\n./mythic-cli install github https://github.com/MythicAgents/forge.git\n\
  ```\n\nThen, use `forge_collections` to show the COFF/BOF modules from the Mythic Forge to be able to select and load them\
  \ into the agent's memory for execution. By default, the following 2 collections are added in Apollo:\n\n- `forge_collections\
  \ {\"collectionName\":\"SharpCollection\"}`\n- `forge_collections {\"collectionName\":\"SliverArmory\"}`\n\nAfter one module\
  \ is loaded, it'll appear in the list as another command like `forge_bof_sa-whoami` or `forge_bof_sa-netuser`.\n\n### PowerShell\
  \ & scripting execution\n\n- `powershell_import`: Imports a new PowerShell script (.ps1) into the agent cache for later\
  \ execution\n- `powershell`: Executes a PowerShell command in the context of the agent, allowing for advanced scripting\
  \ and automation\n- `powerpick`: Injects a PowerShell loader assembly into a sacrificial process and executes a PowerShell\
  \ command (without powershell logging).\n- `psinject`: Executes PowerShell in a specified process, allowing for targeted\
  \ execution of scripts in the context of another process\n- `shell`: Executes a shell command in the context of the agent,\
  \ similar to running a command in cmd.exe\n\n### Lateral Movement\n\n- `jump_psexec`: Uses the PsExec technique to move\
  \ laterally to a new host by first copying over the Apollo agent executable (apollo.exe) and executing it.\n- `jump_wmi`:\
  \ Uses the WMI technique to move laterally to a new host by first copying over the Apollo agent executable (apollo.exe)\
  \ and executing it.\n- `link` and `unlink`: Create and tear down P2P links (for example over SMB/TCP) between callbacks.\n\
  - `wmiexecute`: Executes a command on the local or specified remote system using WMI, with optional credentials for impersonation.\n\
  - `net_dclist`: Retrieves a list of domain controllers for the specified domain, useful for identifying potential targets\
  \ for lateral movement.\n- `net_localgroup`: Lists local groups on the specified computer, defaulting to localhost if no\
  \ computer is specified.\n- `net_localgroup_member`: Retrieves local group membership for a specified group on the local\
  \ or remote computer, allowing for enumeration of users in specific groups.\n- `net_shares`: Lists remote shares and their\
  \ accessibility on the specified computer, useful for identifying potential targets for lateral movement.\n- `socks`: Enables\
  \ a SOCKS 5 compliant proxy on the target network, allowing for tunneling of traffic through the compromised host. Compatible\
  \ with tools like proxychains.\n- `rpfwd`: Starts listening on a specified port on the target host and forwards traffic\
  \ through Mythic to a remote IP and port, allowing for remote access to services on the target network.\n- `listpipes`:\
  \ Lists all named pipes on the local system, which can be useful for lateral movement or privilege escalation by interacting\
  \ with IPC mechanisms.\n\nFor the lower-level WMI execution primitives used underneath `jump_wmi` or `wmiexecute`, check\
  \ [WmiExec](lateral-movement/wmiexec.md). For broader pivoting patterns, check [Tunneling and Port Forwarding](../generic-hacking/tunneling-and-port-forwarding.md).\n\
  \n### Miscellaneous Commands\n- `help`: Displays detailed information about specific commands or general information about\
  \ all available commands in the agent.\n- `clear`: Marks tasks as 'cleared' so they can't be picked up by agents. You can\
  \ specify `all` to clear all tasks or `task Num` to clear a specific task.  \n\n\n## [Poseidon Agent](https://github.com/MythicAgents/poseidon)\n\
  \nPoseidon is a Golang agent that compiles into **Linux and macOS** executables.\n\n```bash\n./mythic-cli install github\
  \ https://github.com/MythicAgents/poseidon.git\n```\n\n### Current build/profile notes\n\n- Current Poseidon builds target\
  \ Linux and macOS on both `x86_64` and `arm64`.\n- Supported output formats include native executables plus shared-library\
  \ style outputs such as `dylib` and `so`.\n- Poseidon supports `http`, `websocket`, `tcp`, and `dynamichttp`, and current\
  \ builders expose multi-egress settings such as `egress_order` and failover thresholds.\n- Build-time options such as `proxy_bypass`\
  \ and `garble` are worth checking when you need either cleaner network behavior or extra Go binary obfuscation.\n\nFor macOS-specific\
  \ tradecraft around Mythic-backed operations, JAMF abuse, or MDM-as-C2 ideas, check [macOS Red Teaming](../macos-hardening/macos-red-teaming/README.md).\n\
  \nWhen used on Linux or macOS it has some interesting commands:\n\n### Common actions\n\n- `cat`: Print the contents of\
  \ a file\n- `cd`: Change the current working directory\n- `chmod`: Change the permissions of a file\n- `config`: View current\
  \ config and host information\n- `cp`: Copy a file from one location to another\n- `curl`: Execute a single web request\
  \ with optional headers and method\n- `upload`: Upload a file to the target\n- `download`: Download a file from the target\
