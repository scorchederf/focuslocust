_body: "# SOAP/JAX-WS ThreadLocal Authentication Bypass\n\n{{#include ../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n## TL;DR\n\n\
  - Some middleware chains store the authenticated `Subject`/`Principal` inside a static `ThreadLocal` and only refresh it\
  \ when a proprietary SOAP header arrives.\n- Because WebLogic/JBoss/GlassFish recycle worker threads, dropping that header\
  \ causes the last privileged `Subject` processed by the thread to be silently reused.\n- Hammer the vulnerable endpoint\
  \ with header-less but well-formed SOAP bodies until a reused thread grants you the stolen administrator context.\n- 2025\
  \ HID ActivID/IASP (HID-PSA-2025-002) is a real-world instance: JAX-WS handler caches a `SubjectHolder` `ThreadLocal`, letting\
  \ unauthenticated SOAP calls inherit the identity set by previous console/SSP requests.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nHandlers similar\
  \ to the following only overwrite the thread-local identity when the custom header is present, so the previous request's\
  \ context survives:\n\n```java\npublic boolean handleMessage(SOAPMessageContext ctx) {\n    if (!outbound) {\n        SOAPHeader\
  \ hdr = ctx.getMessage().getSOAPPart().getEnvelope().getHeader();\n        SOAPHeaderElement e = findHeader(hdr, subjectName);\n\
  \        if (e != null) {\n            SubjectHolder.setSubject(unmarshal(e));\n        }\n    }\n    return true;\n}\n\
  ```\n\n## Recon\n\n1. Enumerate the reverse proxy / routing rules to locate hidden SOAP trees that may block `?wsdl` yet\
  \ accept POSTs (map them alongside the flow in [80,443 - Pentesting Web Methodology](../network-services-pentesting/pentesting-web/README.md)).\n\
  2. Unpack the EAR/WAR/EJB artifacts (`unzip *.ear`) and inspect `application.xml`, `web.xml`, `@WebService` annotations,\
  \ and handler chains (e.g., `LoginHandlerChain.xml`) to uncover the handler class, SOAP header QName, and the backing EJB\
  \ names.\n3. If metadata is missing, brute-force likely `ServiceName?wsdl` paths or temporarily relax lab proxies, then\
  \ import any recovered WSDL into tooling such as [Burp Suite Wsdler](https://portswigger.net/bappstore/594a49bb233748f2bc80a9eb18a2e08f)\
  \ to generate baseline envelopes.\n4. Review the handler sources for `ThreadLocal` keepers (e.g., `SubjectHolder.setSubject()`)\
  \ that are never cleared when the authentication header is missing or malformed.\n\n## Exploitation\n\n1. Send a valid request\
  \ **with** the proprietary header to learn the normal response codes and any error used for invalid tokens.\n2. Resend the\
  \ same SOAP body while omitting the header. Keep the XML well-formed and respect the required namespaces so the handler\
  \ exits cleanly.\n3. Loop the request; when it lands on a thread that previously executed a privileged action, the reused\
  \ `Subject` unlocks protected operations such as user or credential managers.\n\n```http\nPOST /ac-iasp-backend-jaxws/UserManager\
  \ HTTP/1.1\nHost: target\nContent-Type: text/xml;charset=UTF-8\n\n<soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv=\"http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/\"\
  \n                  xmlns:jax=\"http://jaxws.user.frontend.iasp.service.actividentity.com\">\n  <soapenv:Header/>\n  <soapenv:Body>\n\
  \    <jax:findUserIds>\n      <arg0></arg0>\n      <arg1>spl*</arg1>\n    </jax:findUserIds>\n  </soapenv:Body>\n</soapenv:Envelope>\n\
  ```\n\n### 2025 HID ActivID/IASP case study (HID-PSA-2025-002)\n\n- Synacktiv showed the JAX-WS `LoginHandler` in ActivID\
  \ 8.6–8.7 sets `SubjectHolder.subject` when a `mySubjectHeader` SOAP header is present or when console/SSP traffic authenticates,\
  \ but never clears it when the header is absent.\n- Any subsequent SOAP call lacking the header on the same worker thread\
  \ inherits that cached `Subject`, allowing unauthenticated creation of administrator users or credential import via endpoints\
  \ such as `UserManager` or `CredentialManager`.\n- Reliable exploitation pattern observed:\n  1. Trigger an authenticated\
  \ context on many threads (e.g., spam `/ssp` or log into `/aiconsole` as admin in another browser tab).\n  2. Flood header-less\
  \ SOAP bodies to `/ac-iasp-backend-jaxws/UserManager` or other EJB-backed JAX-WS endpoints with high parallelism; each hit\
  \ that reuses an \"infected\" thread executes with elevated `Subject`.\n  3. Repeat until privileged responses are returned;\
  \ reuse Keep-Alive connections and large worker pools to maximize thread reuse probability.\n- Handler and process flow\
  \ highlights:\n  - `LoginHandlerChain.xml` → `LoginHandler.handleMessage()` unmarshals `mySubjectHeader` and stores the\
  \ `Subject` in `SubjectHolder` (a static `ThreadLocal`).\n  - `ProcessManager.triggerProcess()` later injects `SubjectHolder.getSubject()`\
  \ into business processes, so missing headers leave stale identities intact.\n- In-field PoC from the advisory uses two-step\
  \ SOAP abuse: first `getUsers` to leak info, then `createUser` + `importCredential` to plant a rogue admin when the privileged\
  \ thread hits.\n\n## Validating the Bug\n\n- Attach JDWP (`-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,address=5005,suspend=n`)\
  \ or similar debugging hooks to watch the `ThreadLocal` contents before and after each call, confirming that an unauthenticated\
  \ request inherited a prior administrator `Subject`.\n- In production appliances you can also instrument with JFR or BTrace\
  \ to dump `SubjectHolder.getSubject()` per request, verifying header-less reuse.\n\n## References\n\n- [Synacktiv – ActivID\
