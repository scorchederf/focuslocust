  \nOwasp has identified the top 10 machine learning vulnerabilities that can affect AI systems. These vulnerabilities can\
  \ lead to various security issues, including data poisoning, model inversion, and adversarial attacks. Understanding these\
  \ vulnerabilities is crucial for building secure AI systems.\n\nFor an updated and detailed list of the top 10 machine learning\
  \ vulnerabilities, refer to the [OWASP Top 10 Machine Learning Vulnerabilities](https://owasp.org/www-project-machine-learning-security-top-10/)\
  \ project.\n\n- **Input Manipulation Attack**: An attacker adds tiny, often invisible changes to **incoming data** so the\
  \ model makes the wrong decision.\\\n    *Example*: A few specks of paint on a stop‑sign fool a self‑driving car into \"\
  seeing\" a speed‑limit sign.\n\n- **Data Poisoning Attack**: The **training set** is deliberately polluted with bad samples,\
  \ teaching the model harmful rules.\\\n*Example*: Malware binaries are mislabeled as \"benign\" in an antivirus training\
  \ corpus, letting similar malware slip past later.\n\n- **Model Inversion Attack**: By probing outputs, an attacker builds\
  \ a **reverse model** that reconstructs sensitive features of the original inputs.\\\n*Example*: Re‑creating a patient's\
  \ MRI image from a cancer‑detection model's predictions.\n\n- **Membership Inference Attack**: The adversary tests whether\
  \ a **specific record** was used during training by spotting confidence differences.\\\n*Example*: Confirming that a person's\
  \ bank transaction appears in a fraud‑detection model's training data.\n\n- **Model Theft**: Repeated querying lets an attacker\
  \ learn decision boundaries and **clone the model's behavior** (and IP).\\\n*Example*: Harvesting enough Q&A pairs from\
  \ an ML‑as‑a‑Service API to build a near‑equivalent local model.\n\n- **AI Supply‑Chain Attack**: Compromise any component\
  \ (data, libraries, pre‑trained weights, CI/CD) in the **ML pipeline** to corrupt downstream models.\\\n*Example*: A poisoned\
  \ dependency on a model‑hub installs a backdoored sentiment‑analysis model across many apps.\n\n- **Transfer Learning Attack**:\
  \ Malicious logic is planted in a **pre‑trained model** and survives fine‑tuning on the victim's task.\\\n*Example*: A vision\
  \ backbone with a hidden trigger still flips labels after being adapted for medical imaging.\n\n- **Model Skewing**: Subtly\
  \ biased or mislabeled data **shifts the model's outputs** to favor the attacker's agenda.\\\n*Example*: Injecting \"clean\"\
  \ spam emails labeled as ham so a spam filter lets similar future emails through.\n\n- **Output Integrity Attack**: The\
  \ attacker **alters model predictions in transit**, not the model itself, tricking downstream systems.\\\n*Example*: Flipping\
  \ a malware classifier's \"malicious\" verdict to \"benign\" before the file‑quarantine stage sees it.\n\n- **Model Poisoning**\
  \ --- Direct, targeted changes to the **model parameters** themselves, often after gaining write access, to alter behavior.\\\
  \n*Example*: Tweaking weights on a fraud‑detection model in production so transactions from certain cards are always approved.\n\
  \n\n## Google SAIF Risks\n\nGoogle's [SAIF (Security AI Framework)](https://saif.google/secure-ai-framework/risks) outlines\
  \ various risks associated with AI systems:\n\n- **Data Poisoning**: Malicious actors alter or inject training/tuning data\
  \ to degrade accuracy, implant backdoors, or skew results, undermining model integrity across the entire data-lifecycle.\
  \ \n\n- **Unauthorized Training Data**: Ingesting copyrighted, sensitive, or unpermitted datasets creates legal, ethical,\
  \ and performance liabilities because the model learns from data it was never allowed to use. \n\n- **Model Source Tampering**:\
  \ Supply-chain or insider manipulation of model code, dependencies, or weights before or during training can embed hidden\
  \ logic that persists even after retraining. \n\n- **Excessive Data Handling**: Weak data-retention and governance controls\
  \ lead systems to store or process more personal data than necessary, heightening exposure and compliance risk. \n\n- **Model\
  \ Exfiltration**: Attackers steal model files/weights, causing loss of intellectual property and enabling copy-cat services\
  \ or follow-on attacks. \n\n- **Model Deployment Tampering**: Adversaries modify model artifacts or serving infrastructure\
  \ so the running model differs from the vetted version, potentially changing behaviour. \n\n- **Denial of ML Service**:\
  \ Flooding APIs or sending “sponge” inputs can exhaust compute/energy and knock the model offline, mirroring classic DoS\
  \ attacks. \n\n- **Model Reverse Engineering**: By harvesting large numbers of input-output pairs, attackers can clone or\
  \ distil the model, fueling imitation products and customized adversarial attacks. \n\n- **Insecure Integrated Component**:\
  \ Vulnerable plugins, agents, or upstream services let attackers inject code or escalate privileges within the AI pipeline.\
  \ \n\n- **Prompt Injection**: Crafting prompts (directly or indirectly) to smuggle instructions that override system intent,\
  \ making the model perform unintended commands. \n\n- **Model Evasion**: Carefully designed inputs trigger the model to\
  \ mis-classify, hallucinate, or output disallowed content, eroding safety and trust. \n\n- **Sensitive Data Disclosure**:\
  \ The model reveals private or confidential information from its training data or user context, violating privacy and regulations.\
  \ \n\n- **Inferred Sensitive Data**: The model deduces personal attributes that were never provided, creating new privacy\
  \ harms through inference. \n\n- **Insecure Model Output**: Unsanitized responses pass harmful code, misinformation, or\
  \ inappropriate content to users or downstream systems. \n\n- **Rogue Actions**: Autonomously-integrated agents execute\
  \ unintended real-world operations (file writes, API calls, purchases, etc.) without adequate user oversight.\n\n## Mitre\
  \ AI ATLAS Matrix\n\nThe [MITRE AI ATLAS Matrix](https://atlas.mitre.org/matrices/ATLAS) provides a comprehensive framework\
  \ for understanding and mitigating risks associated with AI systems. It categorizes various attack techniques and tactics\
  \ that adversaries may use against AI models and also how to use AI systems to perform different attacks.\n\n\n## LLMJacking\
  \ (Token Theft & Resale of Cloud-hosted LLM Access)\n\nAttackers steal active session tokens or cloud API credentials and\
  \ invoke paid, cloud-hosted LLMs without authorization. Access is often resold via reverse proxies that front the victim’s\
  \ account, e.g. \"oai-reverse-proxy\" deployments. Consequences include financial loss, model misuse outside policy, and\
  \ attribution to the victim tenant.\n\nTTPs:\n- Harvest tokens from infected developer machines or browsers; steal CI/CD\
  \ secrets; buy leaked cookies.\n- Stand up a reverse proxy that forwards requests to the genuine provider, hiding the upstream\
  \ key and multiplexing many customers.\n- Abuse direct base-model endpoints to bypass enterprise guardrails and rate limits.\n\
  \nMitigations:\n- Bind tokens to device fingerprint, IP ranges, and client attestation; enforce short expirations and refresh\
  \ with MFA.\n- Scope keys minimally (no tool access, read-only where applicable); rotate on anomaly.\n- Terminate all traffic\
  \ server-side behind a policy gateway that enforces safety filters, per-route quotas, and tenant isolation.\n- Monitor for\
  \ unusual usage patterns (sudden spend spikes, atypical regions, UA strings) and auto-revoke suspicious sessions.\n- Prefer\
  \ mTLS or signed JWTs issued by your IdP over long-lived static API keys.\n\n## Self-hosted LLM inference hardening\n\n\
  Running a local LLM server for confidential data creates a different attack surface from cloud-hosted APIs: inference/debug\
  \ endpoints may leak prompts, the serving stack usually exposes a reverse proxy, and GPU device nodes give access to large\
  \ `ioctl()` surfaces. If you are assessing or deploying an on-prem inference service, review at least the following points.\n\
  \n### Prompt leakage via debug and monitoring endpoints\n\nTreat the inference API as a **multi-user sensitive service**.\
  \ Debug or monitoring routes can expose prompt contents, slot state, model metadata, or internal queue information. In `llama.cpp`,\
  \ the `/slots` endpoint is especially sensitive because it exposes per-slot state and is only meant for slot inspection/management.\n\
  \n- Put a reverse proxy in front of the inference server and **deny by default**.\n- Only allowlist the exact HTTP method\
  \ + path combinations that are needed by the client/UI.\n- Disable introspection endpoints in the backend itself whenever\
  \ possible, for example `llama-server --no-slots`.\n- Bind the reverse proxy to `127.0.0.1` and expose it through an authenticated\
  \ transport such as SSH local port forwarding instead of publishing it on the LAN.\n\nExample allowlist with nginx:\n\n\
  ```nginx\nmap \"$request_method:$uri\" $llm_whitelist {\n    default 0;\n\n    \"GET:/health\"              1;\n    \"GET:/v1/models\"\
  \           1;\n    \"POST:/v1/completions\"     1;\n    \"POST:/v1/chat/completions\" 1;\n}\n\nserver {\n    listen 127.0.0.1:80;\n\
  \n    location / {\n        if ($llm_whitelist = 0) { return 403; }\n        proxy_pass http://unix:/run/llama-cpp/llama-cpp.sock:;\n\
  \    }\n}\n```\n\n### Rootless containers with no network and UNIX sockets\n\nIf the inference daemon supports listening\
  \ on a UNIX socket, prefer that over TCP and run the container with **no network stack**:\n\n```bash\npodman run --rm -d\
  \ \\\n  --network none \\\n  --user 1000:1000 \\\n  --userns=keep-id \\\n  --umask=007 \\\n  --volume /var/lib/models:/models:ro\
  \ \\\n  --volume /srv/llm/socks:/run/llama-cpp \\\n  ghcr.io/ggml-org/llama.cpp:server-cuda13 \\\n    --host /run/llama-cpp/llama-cpp.sock\
  \ \\\n    --model /models/model.gguf \\\n    --parallel 4 \\\n    --no-slots\n```\n\nBenefits:\n- `--network none` removes\
  \ inbound/outbound TCP/IP exposure and avoids user-mode helpers that rootless containers would otherwise need.\n- A UNIX\
  \ socket lets you use POSIX permissions/ACLs on the socket path as the first access-control layer.\n- `--userns=keep-id`\
  \ and rootless Podman reduce the impact of a container breakout because container root is not host root.\n- Read-only model\
  \ mounts reduce the chance of model tampering from inside the container.\n\n### GPU device-node minimization\n\nFor GPU-backed\
  \ inference, `/dev/nvidia*` files are high-value local attack surfaces because they expose large driver `ioctl()` handlers\
  \ and potentially shared GPU memory-management paths.\n\n- Do not leave `/dev/nvidia*` world writable.\n- Restrict `nvidia`,\
  \ `nvidiactl`, and `nvidia-uvm` with `NVreg_DeviceFileUID/GID/Mode`, udev rules, and ACLs so only the mapped container UID\
  \ can open them.\n- Blacklist unnecessary modules such as `nvidia_drm`, `nvidia_modeset`, and `nvidia_peermem` on headless\
  \ inference hosts.\n- Preload only required modules at boot instead of letting the runtime opportunistically `modprobe`\
  \ them during inference startup.\n\nExample:\n\n```bash\noptions nvidia NVreg_DeviceFileUID=0\noptions nvidia NVreg_DeviceFileGID=0\n\
  options nvidia NVreg_DeviceFileMode=0660\n```\n\nOne important review point is **`/dev/nvidia-uvm`**. Even if the workload\
  \ does not explicitly use `cudaMallocManaged()`, recent CUDA runtimes may still require `nvidia-uvm`. Because this device\
  \ is shared and handles GPU virtual memory management, treat it as a cross-tenant data-exposure surface. If the inference\
  \ backend supports it, a Vulkan backend can be an interesting trade-off because it may avoid exposing `nvidia-uvm` to the\
  \ container at all.\n\n### LSM confinement for inference workers\n\nAppArmor/SELinux/seccomp should be used as defense in\
  \ depth around the inference process:\n\n- Allow only the shared libraries, model paths, socket directory, and GPU device\
  \ nodes that are actually required.\n- Explicitly deny high-risk capabilities such as `sys_admin`, `sys_module`, `sys_rawio`,\
  \ and `sys_ptrace`.\n- Keep the model directory read-only and scope writable paths to the runtime socket/cache directories\
  \ only.\n- Monitor denial logs because they provide useful detection telemetry when the model server or a post-exploitation\
  \ payload tries to escape its expected behaviour.\n\nExample AppArmor rules for a GPU-backed worker:\n\n```text\ndeny capability\
  \ sys_admin,\ndeny capability sys_module,\ndeny capability sys_rawio,\ndeny capability sys_ptrace,\n\n/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/**\
  \ mr,\n/dev/nvidiactl rw,\n/dev/nvidia0 rw,\n/var/lib/models/** r,\nowner /srv/llm/** rw,\n```\n\n## References\n- [Unit\
