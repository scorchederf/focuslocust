  \n## Enhancing Race Condition Attacks\n\nThe main hurdle in taking advantage of race conditions is making sure that multiple\
  \ requests are handled at the same time, with **very little difference in their processing times—ideally, less than 1ms**.\n\
  \nHere you can find some techniques for Synchronizing Requests:\n\n#### HTTP/2 Single-Packet Attack vs. HTTP/1.1 Last-Byte\
  \ Synchronization\n\n- **HTTP/2**: Supports sending two requests over a single TCP connection, reducing network jitter impact.\
  \ However, due to server-side variations, two requests may not suffice for a consistent race condition exploit.\n- **HTTP/1.1\
  \ 'Last-Byte Sync'**: Enables the pre-sending of most parts of 20-30 requests, withholding a small fragment, which is then\
  \ sent together, achieving simultaneous arrival at the server.\n\n**Preparation for Last-Byte Sync** involves:\n\n1. Sending\
  \ headers and body data minus the final byte without ending the stream.\n2. Pausing for 100ms post-initial send.\n3. Disabling\
  \ TCP_NODELAY to utilize Nagle's algorithm for batching final frames.\n4. Pinging to warm up the connection.\n\nThe subsequent\
  \ sending of withheld frames should result in their arrival in a single packet, verifiable via Wireshark. This method does\
  \ not apply to static files, which are not typically involved in RC attacks.\n\n#### HTTP/3 Last‑Frame Synchronization (QUIC)\n\
  \n- **Concept**: HTTP/3 rides over QUIC (UDP). There’s no TCP coalescing or Nagle to rely on, so classic last‑byte sync\
  \ doesn’t work with off‑the‑shelf clients. Instead, you need to deliberately coalesce multiple QUIC stream‑final DATA frames\
  \ (FIN) into the same UDP datagram so the server processes all target requests in the same scheduling tick.\n- **How to\
  \ do it**: Use a purpose‑built library that exposes QUIC frame control. For example, H3SpaceX manipulates quic-go to implement\
  \ HTTP/3 last‑frame synchronization for both requests with a body and GET‑style requests without a body.\n  - Requests‑with‑body:\
  \ send HEADERS + DATA minus the last byte for N streams, then flush the final byte of each stream together.\n  - GET‑style:\
  \ craft fake DATA frames (or a tiny body with Content‑Length) and end all streams in one datagram.\n- **Practical limits**:\n\
  \  - Concurrency is bounded by the peer’s QUIC max_streams transport parameter (similar to HTTP/2’s SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS).\
  \ If it’s low, open multiple H3 connections and spread the race across them.\n  - UDP datagram size and path MTU cap how\
  \ many stream‑final frames you can coalesce. The library handles splitting into multiple datagrams if needed, but a single‑datagram\
  \ flush is most reliable.\n- **Practice**: There are public H2/H3 race labs and sample exploits accompanying H3SpaceX.\n\
  \n<details>\n<summary>HTTP/3 last‑frame sync (Go + H3SpaceX) minimal example</summary>\n\n```go\npackage main\nimport (\n\
  \  \"crypto/tls\"\n  \"context\"\n  \"time\"\n  \"github.com/nxenon/h3spacex\"\n  h3 \"github.com/nxenon/h3spacex/http3\"\
  \n)\nfunc main(){\n  tlsConf := &tls.Config{InsecureSkipVerify:true, NextProtos:[]string{h3.NextProtoH3}}\n  quicConf :=\
  \ &quic.Config{MaxIdleTimeout:10*time.Second, KeepAlivePeriod:10*time.Millisecond}\n  conn, _ := quic.DialAddr(context.Background(),\
  \ \"IP:PORT\", tlsConf, quicConf)\n  var reqs []*http.Request\n  for i:=0;i<50;i++{ r,_ := h3.GetRequestObject(\"https://target/apply\"\
  , \"POST\", map[string]string{\"Cookie\":\"sess=...\",\"Content-Type\":\"application/json\"}, []byte(`{\"coupon\":\"SAVE\"\
  }`)); reqs = append(reqs,&r) }\n  // keep last byte (1), sleep 150ms, set Content-Length\n  h3.SendRequestsWithLastFrameSynchronizationMethod(conn,\
  \ reqs, 1, 150, true)\n}\n```\n</details>\n\n### Adapting to Server Architecture\n\nUnderstanding the target's architecture\
  \ is crucial. Front-end servers might route requests differently, affecting timing. Preemptive server-side connection warming,\
  \ through inconsequential requests, might normalize request timing.\n\n#### Handling Session-Based Locking\n\nFrameworks\
  \ like PHP's session handler serialize requests by session, potentially obscuring vulnerabilities. Utilizing different session\
  \ tokens for each request can circumvent this issue.\n\n#### Overcoming Rate or Resource Limits\n\nIf connection warming\
  \ is ineffective, triggering web servers' rate or resource limit delays intentionally through a flood of dummy requests\
  \ might facilitate the single-packet attack by inducing a server-side delay conducive to race conditions.\n\n## Attack Examples\n\
  \n- **Turbo Intruder - HTTP2 single-packet attack (1 endpoint)**: You can send the request to **Turbo intruder** (`Extensions`\
  \ -> `Turbo Intruder` -> `Send to Turbo Intruder`), you can change in the request the value you want to brute force for\
  \ **`%s`** like in `csrf=Bn9VQB8OyefIs3ShR2fPESR0FzzulI1d&username=carlos&password=%s` and then select the **`examples/race-single-packer-attack.py`**\
  \ from the drop down:\n\n<figure><img src=\"../images/image (57).png\" alt=\"\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\nIf\
  \ you are going to **send different values**, you could modify the code with this one that uses a wordlist from the clipboard:\n\
  \n```python\n    passwords = wordlists.clipboard\n    for password in passwords:\n        engine.queue(target.req, password,\
  \ gate='race1')\n```\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> If the web doesn't support HTTP2 (only HTTP1.1) use `Engine.THREADED` or `Engine.BURP`\
  \ instead of `Engine.BURP2`.\n\n- **Turbo Intruder - HTTP2 single-packet attack (Several endpoints)**: In case you need\
  \ to send a request to 1 endpoint and then multiple to other endpoints to trigger the RCE, you can change the `race-single-packet-attack.py`\
  \ script with something like:\n\n```python\ndef queueRequests(target, wordlists):\n    engine = RequestEngine(endpoint=target.endpoint,\n\
  \                           concurrentConnections=1,\n                           engine=Engine.BURP2\n                 \
  \          )\n\n    # Hardcode the second request for the RC\n    confirmationReq = '''POST /confirm?token[]= HTTP/2\nHost:\
  \ 0a9c00370490e77e837419c4005900d0.web-security-academy.net\nCookie: phpsessionid=MpDEOYRvaNT1OAm0OtAsmLZ91iDfISLU\nContent-Length:\
  \ 0\n\n'''\n\n    # For each attempt (20 in total) send 50 confirmation requests.\n    for attempt in range(20):\n     \
  \   currentAttempt = str(attempt)\n        username = 'aUser' + currentAttempt\n\n        # queue a single registration\
  \ request\n        engine.queue(target.req, username, gate=currentAttempt)\n\n        # queue 50 confirmation requests -\
  \ note that this will probably sent in two separate packets\n        for i in range(50):\n            engine.queue(confirmationReq,\
  \ gate=currentAttempt)\n\n        # send all the queued requests for this attempt\n        engine.openGate(currentAttempt)\n\
  ```\n\n- It's also available in **Repeater** via the new '**Send group in parallel**' option in Burp Suite.\n  - For **limit-overrun**\
  \ you could just add the **same request 50 times** in the group.\n  - For **connection warming**, you could **add** at the\
  \ **beginning** of the **group** some **requests** to some non static part of the web server.\n  - For **delaying** the\
  \ process **between** processing **one request and another** in a 2 substates steps, you could **add extra requests between**\
  \ both requests.\n  - For a **multi-endpoint** RC you could start sending the **request** that **goes to the hidden state**\
  \ and then **50 requests** just after it that **exploits the hidden state**.\n\n<figure><img src=\"../images/image (58).png\"\
  \ alt=\"\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n- **Automated python script**: The goal of this script is to change the\
  \ email of a user while continually verifying it until the verification token of the new email arrives to the last email\
  \ (this is because in the code it was seeing a RC where it was possible to modify an email but have the verification sent\
  \ to the old one because the variable indicating the email was already populated with the first one).\\\n  When the word\
  \ \"objetivo\" is found in the received emails we know we received the verification token of the changed email and we end\
  \ the attack.\n\n```python\n# https://portswigger.net/web-security/race-conditions/lab-race-conditions-limit-overrun\n#\

  \ gating notes\n\n- Engine selection: use `Engine.BURP2` on HTTP/2 targets to trigger the single‑packet attack; fall back\
  \ to `Engine.THREADED` or `Engine.BURP` for HTTP/1.1 last‑byte sync.\n- `gate`/`openGate`: queue many copies with `gate='race1'`\
  \ (or per‑attempt gates), which withholds the tail of each request; `openGate('race1')` flushes all tails together so they\
  \ arrive nearly simultaneously.\n- Diagnostics: negative timestamps in Turbo Intruder indicate the server responded before\
  \ the request was fully sent, proving overlap. This is expected in true races.\n- Connection warming: send a ping or a few\
  \ harmless requests first to stabilise timings; optionally disable `TCP_NODELAY` to encourage batching of the final frames.\n\
  \n\n### Improving Single Packet Attack\n\nIn the original research it's explained that this attack has a limit of 1,500\
  \ bytes. However, in [**this post**](https://flatt.tech/research/posts/beyond-the-limit-expanding-single-packet-race-condition-with-first-sequence-sync/),\
  \ it was explained how it's possible to extend the 1,500-byte limitation of the single packet attack to the **65,535 B window\
  \ limitation of TCP by using IP layer fragmentation** (splitting a single packet into multiple IP packets) and sending them\
  \ in different order, allowed to prevent reassembling the packet until all the fragments reached the server. This technique\
  \ allowed the researcher to send 10,000 requests in about 166ms.\n\nNote that although this improvement makes the attack\
  \ more reliable in RC that requires hundreds/thousands of packets to arrive at the same time, it might also have some software\
  \ limitations. Some popular HTTP servers like Apache, Nginx and Go have a strict `SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS` setting\
  \ to 100, 128 and 250. However, others like NodeJS and nghttp2 have it unlimited.\\\nThis basically means that Apache will\
  \ only consider 100 HTTP connections from a single TCP connection (limiting this RC attack). For HTTP/3, the analogous limit\
  \ is QUIC’s max_streams transport parameter – if it’s small, spread your race across multiple QUIC connections.\n\nYou can\
  \ find some examples using this technique in the repo [https://github.com/Ry0taK/first-sequence-sync/tree/main](https://github.com/Ry0taK/first-sequence-sync/tree/main).\n\
  \n## Raw BF\n\nBefore the previous research these were some payloads used which just tried to send the packets as fast as\
  \ possible to cause a RC.\n\n- **Repeater:** Check the examples from the previous section.\n- **Intruder**: Send the **request**\
  \ to **Intruder**, set the **number of threads** to **30** inside the **Options menu and,** select as payload **Null payloads**\
  \ and generate **30.**\n- **Turbo Intruder**\n\n```python\ndef queueRequests(target, wordlists):\n    engine = RequestEngine(endpoint=target.endpoint,\n\
  \                           concurrentConnections=5,\n                           requestsPerConnection=1,\n            \
  \               pipeline=False\n                           )\n    a = ['Session=<session_id_1>','Session=<session_id_2>','Session=<session_id_3>']\n\
  \    for i in range(len(a)):\n        engine.queue(target.req,a[i], gate='race1')\n    # open TCP connections and send partial\
  \ requests\n    engine.start(timeout=10)\n    engine.openGate('race1')\n    engine.complete(timeout=60)\n\ndef handleResponse(req,\
  \ interesting):\n    table.add(req)\n```\n\n- **Python - asyncio**\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\nimport httpx\n\nasync def\
  \ use_code(client):\n    resp = await client.post(f'http://victim.com', cookies={\"session\": \"asdasdasd\"}, data={\"code\"\
  : \"123123123\"})\n    return resp.text\n\nasync def main():\n    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:\n        tasks\
  \ = []\n        for _ in range(20): #20 times\n            tasks.append(asyncio.ensure_future(use_code(client)))\n\n   \
  \     # Get responses\n        results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)\n\n        # Print results\n\
  \        for r in results:\n            print(r)\n\n        # Async2sync sleep\n        await asyncio.sleep(0.5)\n    print(results)\n\
  \nasyncio.run(main())\n```\n\n## **RC Methodology**\n\n### Limit-overrun / TOCTOU\n\nThis is the most basic type of race\
  \ condition where **vulnerabilities** that **appear** in places that **limit the number of times you can perform an action**.\
  \ Like using the same discount code in a web store several times. A very easy example can be found in [**this report**](https://medium.com/@pravinponnusamy/race-condition-vulnerability-found-in-bug-bounty-program-573260454c43)\
  \ or in [**this bug**](https://hackerone.com/reports/759247)**.**\n\nThere are many variations of this kind of attack, including:\n\
  \n- Redeeming a gift card multiple times\n- Rating a product multiple times\n- Withdrawing or transferring cash in excess\
  \ of your account balance\n- Reusing a single CAPTCHA solution\n- Bypassing an anti-brute-force rate limit\n\n### **Hidden\
  \ substates**\n\nExploiting complex race conditions often involves taking advantage of brief opportunities to interact with\
  \ hidden or **unintended machine substates**. Here’s how to approach this:\n\n1. **Identify Potential Hidden Substates**\n\
  \   - Start by pinpointing endpoints that modify or interact with critical data, such as user profiles or password reset\
  \ processes. Focus on:\n     - **Storage**: Prefer endpoints that manipulate server-side persistent data over those handling\
  \ data client-side.\n     - **Action**: Look for operations that alter existing data, which are more likely to create exploitable\
  \ conditions compared to those that add new data.\n     - **Keying**: Successful attacks usually involve operations keyed\
  \ on the same identifier, e.g., username or reset token.\n2. **Conduct Initial Probing**\n   - Test the identified endpoints\
  \ with race condition attacks, observing for any deviations from expected outcomes. Unexpected responses or changes in application\
  \ behavior can signal a vulnerability.\n3. **Demonstrate the Vulnerability**\n   - Narrow down the attack to the minimal\
  \ number of requests needed to exploit the vulnerability, often just two. This step might require multiple attempts or automation\
  \ due to the precise timing involved.\n\n### Time Sensitive Attacks\n\nPrecision in timing requests can reveal vulnerabilities,\
  \ especially when predictable methods like timestamps are used for security tokens. For instance, generating password reset\
  \ tokens based on timestamps could allow identical tokens for simultaneous requests.\n\n**To Exploit:**\n\n- Use precise\
  \ timing, like a single packet attack, to make concurrent password reset requests. Identical tokens indicate a vulnerability.\n\
  \n**Example:**\n\n- Request two password reset tokens at the same time and compare them. Matching tokens suggest a flaw\
  \ in token generation.\n\n**Check this** [**PortSwigger Lab**](https://portswigger.net/web-security/race-conditions/lab-race-conditions-exploiting-time-sensitive-vulnerabilities)\
  \ **to try this.**\n\n## Hidden substates case studies\n\n### Pay & add an Item\n\nCheck this [**PortSwigger Lab**](https://portswigger.net/web-security/logic-flaws/examples/lab-logic-flaws-insufficient-workflow-validation)\
  \ to see how to **pay** in a store and **add an extra** item you that **won't need to pay for it**.\n\n### Confirm other\
  \ emails\n\nThe idea is to **verify an email address and change it to a different one at the same time** to find out if\
  \ the platform verifies the new one changed.\n\n### Change email to 2 emails addresses Cookie based\n\nAccording to [**this\
  \ research**](https://portswigger.net/research/smashing-the-state-machine) Gitlab was vulnerable to a takeover this way\
  \ because it might **send** the **email verification token of one email to the other email**.\n\n**Check this** [**PortSwigger\
  \ Lab**](https://portswigger.net/web-security/race-conditions/lab-race-conditions-single-endpoint) **to try this.**\n\n\
  ### Hidden Database states / Confirmation Bypass\n\nIf **2 different writes** are used to **add** **information** inside\
  \ a **database**, there is a small portion of time where **only the first data has been written** inside the database. For\
  \ example, when creating a user the **username** and **password** might be **written** and **then the token** to confirm\
  \ the newly created account is written. This means that for a small time the **token to confirm an account is null**.\n\n\
  Therefore **registering an account and sending several requests with an empty token** (`token=` or `token[]=` or any other\
  \ variation) to confirm the account right away could allow to c**onfirm an account** where you don't control the email.\n\
  \n**Check this** [**PortSwigger Lab**](https://portswigger.net/web-security/race-conditions/lab-race-conditions-partial-construction)\
  \ **to try this.**\n\n### Bypass 2FA\n\nThe following pseudo-code is vulnerable to race condition because in a very small\
  \ time the **2FA is not enforced** while the session is created:\n\n```python\nsession['userid'] = user.userid\nif user.mfa_enabled:\n\
  \    session['enforce_mfa'] = True\n    # generate and send MFA code to user\n    # redirect browser to MFA code entry form\n\
  ```\n\n### OAuth2 eternal persistence\n\nThere are several [**OAUth providers**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OAuth_providers).\
  \ Theses services will allow you to create an application and authenticate users that the provider has registered. In order\
  \ to do so, the **client** will need to **permit your application** to access some of their data inside of the **OAUth provider**.\\\
  \nSo, until here just a common login with google/linkedin/github... where you are prompted with a page saying: \"_Application\
  \ <InsertCoolName> wants to access you information, do you want to allow it?_\"\n\n#### Race Condition in `authorization_code`\n\
  \nThe **problem** appears when you **accept it** and automatically sends an **`authorization_code`** to the malicious application.\
  \ Then, this **application abuses a Race Condition in the OAUth service provider to generate more that one AT/RT** (_Authentication\
  \ Token/Refresh Token_) from the **`authorization_code`** for your account. Basically, it will abuse the fact that you have\
  \ accept the application to access your data to **create several accounts**. Then, if you **stop allowing the application\
  \ to access your data one pair of AT/RT will be deleted, but the other ones will still be valid**.\n\n#### Race Condition\
  \ in `Refresh Token`\n\nOnce you have **obtained a valid RT** you could try to **abuse it to generate several AT/RT** and\
  \ **even if the user cancels the permissions** for the malicious application to access his data, **several RTs will still\
  \ be valid.**\n\n## **RC in WebSockets**\n\n- In [**WS_RaceCondition_PoC**](https://github.com/redrays-io/WS_RaceCondition_PoC)\
  \ you can find a PoC in Java to send websocket messages in **parallel** to abuse **Race Conditions also in Web Sockets**.\n\
  - With Burp’s WebSocket Turbo Intruder you can use the **THREADED** engine to spawn multiple WS connections and fire payloads\
  \ in parallel. Start from the official example and tune `config()` (thread count) for concurrency; this is often more reliable\
  \ than batching on a single connection when racing server‑side state across WS handlers. See [RaceConditionExample.py](https://github.com/d0ge/WebSocketTurboIntruder/blob/main/src/main/resources/examples/RaceConditionExample.py).\n\
