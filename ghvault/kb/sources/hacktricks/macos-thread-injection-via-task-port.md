  \n## 1. Thread Hijacking\n\nInitially, the `task_threads()` function is invoked on the task port to obtain a thread list\
  \ from the remote task. A thread is selected for hijacking. This approach diverges from conventional code-injection methods\
  \ as creating a new remote thread is prohibited due to the mitigation that blocks `thread_create_running()`.\n\nTo control\
  \ the thread, `thread_suspend()` is called, halting its execution.\n\nThe only operations permitted on the remote thread\
  \ involve **stopping** and **starting** it and **retrieving**/**modifying** its register values. Remote function calls are\
  \ initiated by setting registers `x0` to `x7` to the **arguments**, configuring `pc` to target the desired function, and\
  \ resuming the thread. Ensuring the thread does not crash after the return necessitates detection of the return.\n\nOne\
  \ strategy involves registering an **exception handler** for the remote thread using `thread_set_exception_ports()`, setting\
  \ the `lr` register to an invalid address before the function call. This triggers an exception post-function execution,\
  \ sending a message to the exception port, enabling state inspection of the thread to recover the return value. Alternatively,\
  \ as adopted from Ian Beer’s *triple_fetch* exploit, `lr` is set to loop infinitely; the thread’s registers are then continuously\
  \ monitored until `pc` points to that instruction.\n\n## 2. Mach ports for communication\n\nThe subsequent phase involves\
  \ establishing Mach ports to facilitate communication with the remote thread. These ports are instrumental in transferring\
  \ arbitrary send/receive rights between tasks.\n\nFor bidirectional communication, two Mach receive rights are created:\
  \ one in the local and the other in the remote task. Subsequently, a send right for each port is transferred to the counterpart\
  \ task, enabling message exchange.\n\nFocusing on the local port, the receive right is held by the local task. The port\
  \ is created with `mach_port_allocate()`. The challenge lies in transferring a send right to this port into the remote task.\n\
  \nA strategy involves leveraging `thread_set_special_port()` to place a send right to the local port in the remote thread’s\
  \ `THREAD_KERNEL_PORT`. Then, the remote thread is instructed to call `mach_thread_self()` to retrieve the send right.\n\
  \nFor the remote port, the process is essentially reversed. The remote thread is directed to generate a Mach port via `mach_reply_port()`\
  \ (as `mach_port_allocate()` is unsuitable due to its return mechanism). Upon port creation, `mach_port_insert_right()`\
  \ is invoked in the remote thread to establish a send right. This right is then stashed in the kernel using `thread_set_special_port()`.\
  \ Back in the local task, `thread_get_special_port()` is used on the remote thread to acquire a send right to the newly\
  \ allocated Mach port in the remote task.\n\nCompletion of these steps results in the establishment of Mach ports, laying\
  \ the groundwork for bidirectional communication.\n\n## 3. Basic Memory Read/Write Primitives\n\nIn this section, the focus\
  \ is on utilizing the execute primitive to establish basic memory read/write primitives. These initial steps are crucial\
  \ for gaining more control over the remote process, though the primitives at this stage won't serve many purposes. Soon,\
  \ they will be upgraded to more advanced versions.\n\n### Memory reading and writing using the execute primitive\n\nThe\
  \ goal is to perform memory reading and writing using specific functions. For **reading memory**:\n\n```c\nuint64_t read_func(uint64_t\
  \ *address) {\n    return *address;\n}\n```\n\nFor **writing memory**:\n\n```c\nvoid write_func(uint64_t *address, uint64_t\
  \ value) {\n    *address = value;\n}\n```\n\nThese functions correspond to the following assembly:\n\n```\n_read_func:\n\
  \    ldr x0, [x0]\n    ret\n_write_func:\n    str x1, [x0]\n    ret\n```\n\n### Identifying suitable functions\n\nA scan\
  \ of common libraries revealed appropriate candidates for these operations:\n\n1. **Reading memory — `property_getName()`**\
  \ (libobjc):\n\n```c\nconst char *property_getName(objc_property_t prop) {\n    return prop->name;\n}\n```\n\n2. **Writing\
  \ memory — `_xpc_int64_set_value()`** (libxpc):\n\n```c\n__xpc_int64_set_value:\n    str x1, [x0, #0x18]\n    ret\n```\n\
  \nTo perform a 64-bit write at an arbitrary address:\n\n```c\n_xpc_int64_set_value(address - 0x18, value);\n```\n\nWith\
  \ these primitives established, the stage is set for creating shared memory, marking a significant progression in controlling\
  \ the remote process.\n\n## 4. Shared Memory Setup\n\nThe objective is to establish shared memory between local and remote\
  \ tasks, simplifying data transfer and facilitating the calling of functions with multiple arguments. The approach leverages\
  \ `libxpc` and its `OS_xpc_shmem` object type, which is built upon Mach memory entries.\n\n### Process overview\n\n1. **Memory\
  \ allocation**\n   * Allocate memory for sharing using `mach_vm_allocate()`.  \n   * Use `xpc_shmem_create()` to create\
  \ an `OS_xpc_shmem` object for the allocated region.\n2. **Creating shared memory in the remote process**\n   * Allocate\
  \ memory for the `OS_xpc_shmem` object in the remote process (`remote_malloc`).  \n   * Copy the local template object;\
  \ fix-up of the embedded Mach send right at offset `0x18` is still required.\n3. **Correcting the Mach memory entry**\n\
  \   * Insert a send right with `thread_set_special_port()` and overwrite the `0x18` field with the remote entry’s name.\n\
  4. **Finalising**\n   * Validate the remote object and map it with a remote call to `xpc_shmem_remote()`.\n\n## 5. Achieving\
  \ Full Control\n\nOnce arbitrary execution and a shared-memory back-channel are available you effectively own the target\
  \ process:\n\n* **Arbitrary memory R/W** — use `memcpy()` between local & shared regions.  \n* **Function calls with > 8\
  \ args** — place the extra arguments on the stack following the arm64 calling convention.  \n* **Mach port transfer** —\
  \ pass rights in Mach messages via the established ports.  \n* **File-descriptor transfer** — leverage fileports (see *triple_fetch*).\n\
  \nAll of this is wrapped in the [`threadexec`](https://github.com/bazad/threadexec) library for easy re-use.\n\n---\n\n\
  ## 6. Apple Silicon (arm64e) Nuances\n\nOn Apple Silicon devices (arm64e) **Pointer Authentication Codes (PAC)** protect\
  \ all return addresses and many function pointers. Thread-hijacking techniques that *reuse existing code* continue to work\
  \ because the original values in `lr`/`pc` already carry valid PAC signatures. Problems arise when you try to jump to attacker-controlled\
  \ memory:\n\n1. Allocate executable memory inside the target (remote `mach_vm_allocate` + `mprotect(PROT_EXEC)`).\n2. Copy\
  \ your payload.\n3. Inside the *remote* process sign the pointer:\n\n```c\nuint64_t ptr = (uint64_t)payload;\nptr = ptrauth_sign_unauthenticated((void*)ptr,\
  \ ptrauth_key_asia, 0);\n```\n\n4. Set `pc = ptr` in the hijacked thread state.\n\nAlternatively, stay PAC-compliant by\
  \ chaining existing gadgets/functions (traditional ROP).\n\n## 7. Detection & Hardening with EndpointSecurity\n\nThe **EndpointSecurity\
  \ (ES)** framework exposes kernel events that allow defenders to observe or block thread-injection attempts:\n\n* `ES_EVENT_TYPE_AUTH_GET_TASK`\
  \ – fired when a process requests another task’s port (e.g. `task_for_pid()`).\n* `ES_EVENT_TYPE_NOTIFY_REMOTE_THREAD_CREATE`\
  \ – emitted whenever a thread is created in a *different* task.\n* `ES_EVENT_TYPE_NOTIFY_THREAD_SET_STATE` (added in macOS\
  \ 14 Sonoma) – indicates register manipulation of an existing thread.\n\nMinimal Swift client that prints remote-thread\
  \ events:\n\n```swift\nimport EndpointSecurity\n\nlet client = try! ESClient(subscriptions: [.notifyRemoteThreadCreate])\
  \ {\n    (_, msg) in\n    if let evt = msg.remoteThreadCreate {\n        print(\"[ALERT] remote thread in pid \\(evt.target.pid)\
  \ by pid \\(evt.thread.pid)\")\n    }\n}\nRunLoop.main.run()\n```\n\nQuerying with **osquery** ≥ 5.8:\n\n```sql\nSELECT\
  \ target_pid, source_pid, target_path\nFROM es_process_events\nWHERE event_type = 'REMOTE_THREAD_CREATE';\n```\n\n### Hardened-runtime\
  \ considerations\n\nDistributing your application **without** the `com.apple.security.get-task-allow` entitlement prevents\
  \ non-root attackers from obtaining its task-port. System Integrity Protection (SIP) still blocks access to many Apple binaries,\
  \ but third-party software must opt-out explicitly.\n\n## 8. Recent Public Tooling (2023-2025)\n\n| Tool | Year | Remarks\
  \ |\n|------|------|---------|\n| [`task_vaccine`](https://github.com/rodionovd/task_vaccine) | 2023 | Compact PoC that\
  \ demonstrates PAC-aware thread hijacking on Ventura/Sonoma |\n| `remote_thread_es` | 2024 | EndpointSecurity helper used\
  \ by several EDR vendors to surface `REMOTE_THREAD_CREATE` events |\n\n> Reading these projects’ source code is useful to\
  \ understand API changes introduced in macOS 13/14 and to stay compatible across Intel ↔ Apple Silicon.\n\n## References\n\
