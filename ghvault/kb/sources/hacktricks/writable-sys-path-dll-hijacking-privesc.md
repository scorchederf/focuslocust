  \nIf you found that you can **write in a System Path folder** (note that this won't work if you can write in a User Path\
  \ folder) it's possible that you could **escalate privileges** in the system.\n\nIn order to do that you can abuse a **Dll\
  \ Hijacking** where you are going to **hijack a library being loaded** by a service or process with **more privileges**\
  \ than yours, and because that service is loading a Dll that probably doesn't even exist in the entire system, it's going\
  \ to try to load it from the System Path where you can write.\n\nFor more info about **what is Dll Hijackig** check:\n\n\
  \n{{#ref}}\n./\n{{#endref}}\n\n## Privesc with Dll Hijacking\n\n### Finding a missing Dll\n\nThe first thing you need is\
  \ to **identify a process** running with **more privileges** than you that is trying to **load a Dll from the System Path**\
  \ you can write in.\n\nRemember that this technique depends on a **Machine/System PATH** entry, not only on your **User\
  \ PATH**. Therefore, before spending time on Procmon, it's worth enumerating the **Machine PATH** entries and checking which\
  \ ones are writable:\n\n```powershell\n$machinePath = [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable(\"Path\", \"Machine\") -split\
  \ ';' | Where-Object { $_ }\n$machinePath | ForEach-Object {\n    $path = $_.Trim()\n    if ($path) {\n        Write-Host\
  \ \"`n[*] $path\"\n        icacls $path 2>$null\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe problem in this cases is that probably thoses processes\
  \ are already running. To find which Dlls are lacking the services you need to launch procmon as soon as possible (before\
  \ processes are loaded). So, to find lacking .dlls do:\n\n- **Create** the folder `C:\\privesc_hijacking` and add the path\
  \ `C:\\privesc_hijacking` to **System Path env variable**. You can do this **manually** or with **PS**:\n\n```bash\n# Set\
  \ the folder path to create and check events for\n$folderPath = \"C:\\privesc_hijacking\"\n\n# Create the folder if it does\
  \ not exist\nif (!(Test-Path $folderPath -PathType Container)) {\n    New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $folderPath | Out-Null\n\
  }\n\n# Set the folder path in the System environment variable PATH\n$envPath = [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable(\"\
  PATH\", \"Machine\")\nif ($envPath -notlike \"*$folderPath*\") {\n    $newPath = \"$envPath;$folderPath\"\n    [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable(\"\
  PATH\", $newPath, \"Machine\")\n}\n```\n\n- Launch **`procmon`** and go to **`Options`** --> **`Enable boot logging`** and\
  \ press **`OK`** in the prompt.\n- Then, **reboot**. When the computer is restarted **`procmon`** will start **recording**\
  \ events asap.\n- Once **Windows** is **started execute `procmon`** again, it'll tell you that it has been running and will\
  \ **ask you if you want to store** the events in a file. Say **yes** and **store the events in a file**.\n- **After** the\
  \ **file** is **generated**, **close** the opened **`procmon`** window and **open the events file**.\n- Add these **filters**\
  \ and you will find all the Dlls that some **proccess tried to load** from the writable System Path folder:\n\n<figure><img\
  \ src=\"../../../images/image (945).png\" alt=\"\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n> [!TIP]\n> **Boot logging is only\
  \ required for services that start too early** to observe otherwise. If you can **trigger the target service/program on\
  \ demand** (for example, by interacting with its COM interface, restarting the service, or relaunching a scheduled task),\
  \ it is usually faster to keep a normal Procmon capture with filters such as **`Path contains .dll`**, **`Result is NAME\
  \ NOT FOUND`**, and **`Path begins with <writable_machine_path>`**.\n\n### Missed Dlls\n\nRunning this in a free **virtual\
  \ (vmware) Windows 11 machine** I got these results:\n\n<figure><img src=\"../../../images/image (607).png\" alt=\"\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\
  \nIn this case the .exe are useless so ignore them, the missed DLLs where from:\n\n| Service                         | Dll\
  \                | CMD line                                                             |\n| -------------------------------\
  \ | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Task Scheduler (Schedule)\
  \       | WptsExtensions.dll | `C:\\Windows\\system32\\svchost.exe -k netsvcs -p -s Schedule`          |\n| Diagnostic Policy\
  \ Service (DPS) | Unknown.DLL        | `C:\\Windows\\System32\\svchost.exe -k LocalServiceNoNetwork -p -s DPS` |\n| ???\
  \                             | SharedRes.dll      | `C:\\Windows\\system32\\svchost.exe -k UnistackSvcGroup`          \
  \      |\n\nAfter finding this, I found this interesting blog post that also explains how to [**abuse WptsExtensions.dll\
  \ for privesc**](https://juggernaut-sec.com/dll-hijacking/#Windows_10_Phantom_DLL_Hijacking_-_WptsExtensionsdll). Which\
  \ is what we **are going to do now**.\n\n### Other candidates worth triaging\n\n`WptsExtensions.dll` is a good example,\
  \ but it is not the only recurring **phantom DLL** that shows up in privileged services. Modern hunting rules and public\
  \ hijack catalogs still track names such as:\n\n| Service / Scenario | Missing DLL | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Task\
  \ Scheduler (`Schedule`) | `WptsExtensions.dll` | Classic **SYSTEM** candidate on client systems. Good when the writable\
  \ directory is in the **Machine PATH** and the service probes the DLL during startup. |\n| NetMan on Windows Server | `wlanhlp.dll`\
  \ / `wlanapi.dll` | Interesting on **server editions** because the service runs as **SYSTEM** and can be **triggered on\
  \ demand by a normal user** in some builds, making it better than reboot-only cases. |\n| Connected Devices Platform Service\
  \ (`CDPSvc`) | `cdpsgshims.dll` | Usually yields **`NT AUTHORITY\\LOCAL SERVICE`** first. That is often still enough because\
  \ the token has **`SeImpersonatePrivilege`**, so you can chain it with [RoguePotato / PrintSpoofer](../roguepotato-and-printspoofer.md).\
  \ |\n\nTreat these names as **triage hints**, not guaranteed wins: they are **SKU/build dependent**, and Microsoft may change\
  \ the behavior between releases. The important takeaway is to look for **missing DLLs in privileged services that traverse\
  \ the Machine PATH**, especially if the service can be **re-triggered without rebooting**.\n\n### Exploitation\n\nSo, to\
  \ **escalate privileges** we are going to hijack the library **WptsExtensions.dll**. Having the **path** and the **name**\
  \ we just need to **generate the malicious dll**.\n\nYou can [**try to use any of these examples**](#creating-and-compiling-dlls).\
  \ You could run payloads such as: get a rev shell, add a user, execute a beacon...\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> Note that **not all\
  \ the service are run** with **`NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM`** some are also run with **`NT AUTHORITY\\LOCAL SERVICE`** which has\
  \ **less privileges** and you **won't be able to create a new user** abuse its permissions.\\\n> However, that user has\
  \ the **`seImpersonate`** privilege, so you can use the[ **potato suite to escalate privileges**](../roguepotato-and-printspoofer.md).\
  \ So, in this case a rev shell is a better option that trying to create a user.\n\nAt the moment of writing the **Task Scheduler**\
  \ service is run with **Nt AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM**.\n\nHaving **generated the malicious Dll** (_in my case I used x64 rev shell\
  \ and I got a shell back but defender killed it because it was from msfvenom_), save it in the writable System Path with\
  \ the name **WptsExtensions.dll** and **restart** the computer (or restart the service or do whatever it takes to rerun\
  \ the affected service/program).\n\nWhen the service is re-started, the **dll should be loaded and executed** (you can **reuse**\
  \ the **procmon** trick to check if the **library was loaded as expected**).\n\n## References\n\n- [Windows DLL Hijacking\
