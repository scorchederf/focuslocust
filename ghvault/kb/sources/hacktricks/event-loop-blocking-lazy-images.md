_body: "# Event Loop Blocking + Lazy images\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\nIn [**this exploit**](https://gist.github.com/aszx87410/155f8110e667bae3d10a36862870ba45),\
  \ [**@aszx87410**](https://twitter.com/aszx87410) mixes the **lazy image side channel** technique through a HTML injection\
  \ with kind of **event loop blocking technique** to leak chars.\n\nThis is a **different exploit for the CTF chall** that\
  \ was already commented in the following page. take a look for more info about the challenge:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nconnection-pool-example.md\n\
  {{#endref}}\n\nThis technique is useful when the attacker can create a **Boolean oracle** based on whether a **lazy-loaded\
  \ image** is fetched or not, but **cannot** directly observe that request because of CSP, `img-src` restrictions, or `Cache-Control:\
  \ no-store`. Instead of waiting for an external callback, the exploit converts image loading into a **timing side channel**\
  \ by making those image requests compete with other requests.\n\nThe idea behind this exploit is:\n\n- The posts are loaded\
  \ alphabetically\n- An **attacker** can **inject** a **post** starting with **\"A\"**, then some **HTML tag** (like a big\
  \ **`<canvas`**) will fulfil most of the **screen** and some final **`<img lazy` tags** to load things.\n- If instead of\
  \ an \"A\" the **attacker injects the same post but starting with a \"z\".** The **post** with the **flag** will appear\
  \ **first**, then the **injected** **post** will appear with the initial \"z\" and the **big** **canvas**. Because the post\
  \ with the flag appeared first, the first canvas will occupy all the screen and the final **`<img lazy`** tags injected\
  \ **won't be seen** in the screen, so they **won't be loaded**.\n- Then, **while** the bot is **accessing** the page, the\
  \ **attacker** will **send fetch requests**.\n  - If the **images** injected in the post are being **loaded**, these **fetch**\
  \ requests will take **longer**, so the attacker knows that the **post is before the flag** (alphabetically).\n  - If the\
  \ the **fetch** requests are **fast**, it means that the **post** is **alphabetically** **after** the flag.\n\nIn other\
  \ words, the oracle is:\n\n- **State 1**: the attacker-controlled post is within the browser lazy-loading threshold, so\
  \ `img loading=lazy` requests are issued.\n- **State 2**: the attacker-controlled post remains outside that threshold, so\
  \ those requests are not issued.\n- **Leak**: the attacker measures whether those extra requests create enough contention\
  \ to delay another measurable operation.\n\nLet's check the code:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <!--\n  The basic\
  \ idea is to create a post with a lot of images which send request to \"/\" to block server-side nodejs event loop.\n  If\
  \ images are loading, the request to \"/\" is slower, otherwise faster.\n  By using a well-crafted height, we can let note\
  \ with \"A\" load image but note with \"Z\" not load.\n  We can use fetch to measure the request time.\n-->\n  <body>\n\

  </html>\n```\n\n## Practical caveats\n\nThis trick is **fragile** and needs to be **calibrated per environment**:\n\n- The\
  \ **lazy-loading distance threshold** is browser-dependent and can change with browser version, connection type, and headless/headful\
  \ mode. Chromium loads off-screen images **before** they are visible, so the right `<canvas height>` is usually found empirically.\n\
  - In practice, **headless Chromium** can require a **different threshold** than a normal browser. In the original writeup,\
  \ a value that worked locally (`1850px`) had to be increased for the remote headless bot (`3350px`).\n- Native `loading=\"\
  lazy\"` is only **deferred when JavaScript is enabled**, so this specific oracle can disappear if the browser disables JS\
  \ or changes lazy-loading behavior for privacy reasons.\n- If the image response is **cacheable**, later probes become noisy\
  \ or useless because the browser may satisfy the request from cache. This is why cache-busting parameters or `Cache-Control:\
  \ no-store` matter a lot when testing this technique.\n\n## Reliability notes\n\nCompared to the related [connection pool\
  \ example](connection-pool-example.md), this variant does **not** need an external image callback. It only needs a measurable\
  \ slowdown. That slowdown can come from:\n\n- **Server-side event-loop blocking**, such as many image requests hitting a\
  \ Node.js endpoint that performs synchronous work.\n- **Socket / connection contention**, where the attacker saturates available\
  \ connections and times how long an additional request takes.\n\nTo make the oracle more stable:\n\n- Use **multiple lazy\
  \ images** instead of one.\n- Add a **cache-buster** to every image URL.\n- Measure **several requests** and compare an\
  \ **average/median** instead of trusting a single sample.\n- Recalculate the **canvas height threshold** against the same\
  \ browser family and execution mode used by the victim bot.\n\nFor more timing-based leak primitives, also check:\n\n{{#ref}}\n\
  performance.now-+-force-heavy-task.md\n{{#endref}}\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> Some privacy-focused defenses can break the \"load\
  \ only after a browser-driven scroll/viewport change\" assumption. For example, XS-Leaks wiki documents `Document-Policy:\
  \ force-load-at-top` as a way to disable load-on-scroll behaviors such as Scroll-to-Text navigation, which can also reduce\
  \ similar viewport-based oracles.\n\n## References\n\n- [https://blog.huli.tw/2022/10/05/en/sekaictf2022-safelist-xsleak/](https://blog.huli.tw/2022/10/05/en/sekaictf2022-safelist-xsleak/)\n\
