  ## Goal\nTurn a mains-powered HID MaxiProx 5375 long-range 125 kHz reader into a field-deployable, battery-powered badge\
  \ cloner that silently harvests proximity cards during physical-security assessments.\n\nThe conversion covered here is\
  \ based on TrustedSec’s “Let’s Clone a Cloner – Part 3: Putting It All Together” research series and combines mechanical,\
  \ electrical and RF considerations so the final device can be thrown in a backpack and immediately used on site.\n\n> [!warning]\n\
  > Manipulating mains-powered equipment and Lithium-ion power-banks can be dangerous.  Verify every connection **before**\
  \ energising the circuit and keep the antennas, coax and ground planes exactly as they were in the factory design to avoid\
  \ detuning the reader.\n\n## Bill of Materials (BOM)\n\n* HID MaxiProx 5375 reader (or any 12 V HID Prox® long-range reader)\n\
  * ESP RFID Tool v2.2 (ESP32-based Wiegand sniffer/logger)\n* USB-PD (Power-Delivery) trigger module able to negotiate 12\
  \ V @ ≥3 A\n* 100 W USB-C power-bank (outputs 12 V PD profile)\n* 26 AWG silicone-insulated hook-up wire – red/white\n*\
  \ Panel-mount SPST toggle switch (for beeper kill-switch)\n* NKK AT4072 switch-guard / accident-proof cap\n* Soldering iron,\
  \ solder wick & desolder pump\n* ABS-rated hand tools: coping-saw, utility-knife, flat & half-round files\n* Drill bits\
  \ 1/16″ (1.5 mm) and 1/8″ (3 mm)\n* 3 M VHB double-sided tape & Zip-ties\n\n## 1. Power Sub-System\n\n1. Desolder and remove\
  \ the factory buck-converter daughter-board used to generate 5 V for the logic PCB.\n2. Mount a USB-PD trigger next to the\
  \ ESP RFID Tool and route the trigger’s USB-C receptacle to the outside of the enclosure.\n3. The PD trigger negotiates\
  \ 12 V from the power-bank and feeds it directly to the MaxiProx (the reader natively expects 10–14 V).  A secondary 5 V\
  \ rail is taken from the ESP board to power any accessories.\n4. The 100 W battery pack is positioned flush against the\
  \ internal standoff so there are **no** power cables draped across the ferrite antenna, preserving RF performance.\n\n##\
  \ 2. Beeper Kill-Switch – Silent Operation\n\n1. Locate the two speaker pads on the MaxiProx logic board.\n2. Wick *both*\
  \ pads clean, then re-solder only the **negative** pad.\n3. Solder 26 AWG wires (white = negative, red = positive) to the\
  \ beeper pads and route them through a newly cut slot to a panel-mount SPST switch.\n4. When the switch is open the beeper\
  \ circuit is broken and the reader operates in complete silence – ideal for covert badge harvesting.\n5. Fit an NKK AT4072\
  \ spring-loaded safety cap over the toggle.  Carefully enlarge the bore with a coping-saw / file until it snaps over the\
  \ switch body.  The guard prevents accidental activation inside a backpack.\n\n## 3. Enclosure & Mechanical Work\n\n• Use\
  \ flush cutters then a knife & file to *remove* the internal ABS “bump-out” so the large USB-C battery sits flat on the\
  \ standoff.\n• Carve two parallel channels in the enclosure wall for the USB-C cable; this locks the battery in place and\
  \ eliminates movement/vibration.\n• Create a rectangular aperture for the battery’s **power** button:\n  1. Tape a paper\
  \ stencil over the location.\n  2. Drill 1/16″ pilot holes in all four corners.\n  3. Enlarge with a 1/8″ bit.\n  4. Join\
  \ the holes with a coping saw; finish the edges with a file.  \n  ✱  A rotary Dremel was *avoided* – the high-speed bit\
  \ melts thick ABS and leaves an ugly edge.\n\n## 4. Final Assembly\n\n1. Re-install the MaxiProx logic board and re-solder\
  \ the SMA pigtail to the reader’s PCB ground pad.\n2. Mount the ESP RFID Tool and USB-PD trigger using 3 M VHB.\n3. Dress\
  \ all wiring with zip-ties, keeping power leads **far** from the antenna loop.\n4. Tighten the enclosure screws until the\
  \ battery is lightly compressed; the internal friction prevents the pack from shifting when the device recoils after every\
  \ card read.\n\n## 5. Range & Shielding Tests\n\n* Using a 125 kHz **Pupa** test card the portable cloner achieved consistent\
  \ reads at **≈ 8 cm** in free-air – identical to mains-powered operation.\n* Placing the reader inside a thin-walled metal\
  \ cash box (to simulate a bank lobby desk) reduced range to ≤ 2 cm, confirming that substantial metal enclosures act as\
  \ effective RF shields.\n\n## Usage Workflow\n\n1. Charge the USB-C battery, connect it, and flip the main power switch.\n\
  2. (Optional) Open the beeper guard and enable audible feedback when bench-testing; lock it down before covert field use.\n\
  3. Walk past the target badge holder – the MaxiProx will energise the card and the ESP RFID Tool captures the Wiegand stream.\n\
  4. Dump captured credentials over Wi-Fi or USB-UART and replay/clone as required.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n| Symptom | Likely\
  \ Cause | Fix |\n|---------|--------------|------|\n| Reader reboots when card presented | PD trigger negotiated 9 V not\
  \ 12 V | Verify trigger jumpers / try higher-power USB-C cable |\n| No read range | Battery or wiring sitting *on top* of\
  \ the antenna | Re-route cables & keep 2 cm clearance around the ferrite loop |\n| Beeper still chirps | Switch wired on\
  \ positive lead instead of negative | Move kill-switch to break the **negative** speaker trace |\n\n## References\n\n- [Let’s\
