_body: "# Unsorted Bin Attack\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n## Basic Information\n\nFor more information\
  \ about what is an unsorted bin check this page:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nbins-and-memory-allocations.md\n{{#endref}}\n\nUnsorted\
  \ lists are able to write the address to `unsorted_chunks (av)` in the `bk` address of the chunk. Therefore, if an attacker\
  \ can **modify the address of the `bk` pointer** in a chunk inside the unsorted bin, he could be able to **write that address\
  \ in an arbitrary address** which could be helpful to leak a Glibc addresses or bypass some defense.\n\nSo, basically, this\
  \ attack allows to **set a big number at an arbitrary address**. This big number is an address, which could be a heap address\
  \ or a Glibc address. A traditional target was **`global_max_fast`** to allow to create fast bin bins with bigger sizes\
  \ (and pass from an unsorted bin attack to a fast bin attack).\n\n- Modern note (glibc ≥ 2.39): `global_max_fast` became\
  \ an 8‑bit global. Blindly writing a pointer there via an unsorted-bin write will clobber adjacent libc data and will not\
  \ reliably raise the fastbin limit anymore. Prefer other targets or other primitives when running against glibc 2.39+. See\
  \ \"Modern constraints\" below and consider combining with other techniques like a [large bin attack](large-bin-attack.md)\
  \ or a [fast bin attack](fast-bin-attack.md) once you have a stable primitive.\n\n> [!TIP]\n> T> aking a look to the example\
  \ provided in [https://ctf-wiki.mahaloz.re/pwn/linux/glibc-heap/unsorted_bin_attack/#principle](https://ctf-wiki.mahaloz.re/pwn/linux/glibc-heap/unsorted_bin_attack/#principle)\
  \ and using 0x4000 and 0x5000 instead of 0x400 and 0x500 as chunk sizes (to avoid Tcache) it's possible to see that **nowadays**\
  \ the error **`malloc(): unsorted double linked list corrupted`** is triggered.\n>\n> Therefore, this unsorted bin attack\
  \ now (among other checks) also requires to be able to fix the doubled linked list so this is bypassed `victim->bk->fd ==\
  \ victim` or not `victim->fd == av (arena)`, which means that the address where we want to write must have the address of\
  \ the fake chunk in its `fd` position and that the fake chunk `fd` is pointing to the arena.\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n> Note that\
  \ this attack corrupts the unsorted bin (hence small and large too). So we can only **use allocations from the fast bin\
  \ now** (a more complex program might do other allocations and crash), and to trigger this we must **allocate the same size\
  \ or the program will crash.**\n>\n> Note that overwriting **`global_max_fast`** might help in this case trusting that the\
  \ fast bin will be able to take care of all the other allocations until the exploit is completed.\n\nThe code from [**guyinatuxedo**](https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/31-unsortedbin_attack/unsorted_explanation/index.html)\
  \ explains it very well, although if you modify the mallocs to allocate memory big enough so don't end in a Tcache you can\
  \ see that the previously mentioned error appears preventing this technique: **`malloc(): unsorted double linked list corrupted`**\n\
  \n### How the write actually happens\n\n- The unsorted-bin write is triggered on `free` when the freed chunk is inserted\
  \ at the head of the unsorted list.\n- During insertion, the allocator performs `bck = unsorted_chunks(av); fwd = bck->fd;\
  \ victim->bk = bck; victim->fd = fwd; fwd->bk = victim; bck->fd = victim;`\n- If you can set `victim->bk` to `(mchunkptr)(TARGET\
  \ - 0x10)` before calling `free(victim)`, the final statement will perform the write: `*(TARGET) = victim`.\n- Later, when\
  \ the allocator processes the unsorted bin, integrity checks will verify (among other things) that `bck->fd == victim` and\
  \ `victim->fd == unsorted_chunks(av)` before unlinking. Because the insertion already wrote `victim` into `bck->fd` (our\
  \ `TARGET`), these checks can be satisfied if the write succeeded.\n\n## Modern constraints (glibc ≥ 2.33)\n\nTo use unsorted‑bin\
  \ writes reliably on current glibc:\n\n- Tcache interference: for sizes that fall into tcache, frees are diverted there\
  \ and won’t touch the unsorted bin. Either\n  - make requests with sizes > MAX_TCACHE_SIZE (≥ 0x410 on 64‑bit by default),\
  \ or\n  - fill the corresponding tcache bin (7 entries) so that additional frees reach the global bins, or\n  - if the environment\
  \ is controllable, disable tcache (e.g., GLIBC_TUNABLES glibc.malloc.tcache_count=0).\n- Integrity checks on the unsorted\
  \ list: on the next allocation path that examines the unsorted bin, glibc checks (simplified):\n  - `bck->fd == victim`\
  \ and `victim->fd == unsorted_chunks(av)`; otherwise it aborts with `malloc(): unsorted double linked list corrupted`.\n\
  \  - This means the address you target must tolerate two writes: first `*(TARGET) = victim` at free‑time; later, as the\
  \ chunk is removed, `*(TARGET) = unsorted_chunks(av)` (the allocator rewrites `bck->fd` back to the bin head). Choose targets\
  \ where simply forcing a large non‑zero value is useful.\n- Typical stable targets in modern exploits\n  - Application or\
  \ global state that treats \"large\" values as flags/limits.\n  - Indirect primitives (e.g., set up for a subsequent [fast\
  \ bin attack]({{#ref}}fast-bin-attack.md{{#endref}}) or to pivot a later write‐what‐where).\n  - Avoid `__malloc_hook`/`__free_hook`\
  \ on new glibc: they were removed in 2.34. Avoid `global_max_fast` on ≥ 2.39 (see next note).\n- About `global_max_fast`\
  \ on recent glibc\n  - On glibc 2.39+, `global_max_fast` is an 8‑bit global. The classic trick of writing a heap pointer\
  \ into it (to enlarge fastbins) no longer works cleanly and is likely to corrupt adjacent allocator state. Prefer other\
  \ strategies.\n\n## Minimal exploitation recipe (modern glibc)\n\nGoal: achieve a single arbitrary write of a heap pointer\
  \ to an arbitrary address using the unsorted‑bin insertion primitive, without crashing.\n\n- Layout/grooming\n  - Allocate\
  \ A, B, C with sizes large enough to bypass tcache (e.g., 0x5000). C prevents consolidation with the top chunk.\n- Corruption\n\
  \  - Overflow from A into B’s chunk header to set `B->bk = (mchunkptr)(TARGET - 0x10)`.\n- Trigger\n  - `free(B)`. At insertion\
  \ time the allocator executes `bck->fd = B`, therefore `*(TARGET) = B`.\n- Continuation\n  - If you plan to continue allocating\
  \ and the program uses the unsorted bin, expect the allocator to later set `*(TARGET) = unsorted_chunks(av)`. Both values\
  \ are typically large and may be enough to change size/limit semantics in targets that only check for \"big\".\n\nPseudocode\
  \ skeleton:\n\n```c\n// 64-bit glibc 2.35–2.38 style layout (tcache bypass via large sizes)\nvoid *A = malloc(0x5000);\n\
  void *B = malloc(0x5000);\nvoid *C = malloc(0x5000); // guard\n\n// overflow from A into B’s metadata (prev_size/size/.../bk).\
  \ You must control B->bk.\n*(size_t *)((char*)B - 0x8) = (size_t)(TARGET - 0x10); // write fake bk\n\nfree(B); // triggers\
  \ *(TARGET) = B (unsorted-bin insertion write)\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> • If you cannot bypass tcache with size, fill the tcache\
  \ bin for the chosen size (7 frees) before freeing the corrupted chunk so the free goes to unsorted.  \n> • If the program\
  \ immediately aborts on the next allocation due to unsorted-bin checks, re‑examine that `victim->fd` still equals the bin\
  \ head and that your `TARGET` holds the exact `victim` pointer after the first write.\n\n## Unsorted Bin Infoleak Attack\n\
  \nThis is actually a very basic concept. The chunks in the unsorted bin are going to have pointers. The first chunk in the\
  \ unsorted bin will actually have the **`fd`** and the **`bk`** links **pointing to a part of the main arena (Glibc)**.\\\
  \nTherefore, if you can **put a chunk inside a unsorted bin and read it** (use after free) or **allocate it again without\
  \ overwriting at least 1 of the pointers** to then **read** it, you can have a **Glibc info leak**.\n\nA similar [**attack\
  \ used in this writeup**](https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/33-custom_misc_heap/csaw18_alienVSsamurai/index.html), was to abuse\
  \ a 4 chunks structure (A, B, C and D - D is only to prevent consolidation with top chunk) so a null byte overflow in B\
  \ was used to make C indicate that B was unused. Also, in B the `prev_size` data was modified so the size instead of being\
  \ the size of B was A+B.\\\nThen C was deallocated, and consolidated with A+B (but B was still in used). A new chunk of\
  \ size A was allocated and then the libc leaked addresses was written into B from where they were leaked.\n\n## References\

  \  - The goal is to overwrite a global variable with a value greater than 4869 so it's possible to get the flag and PIE\
  \ is not enabled.\n  - It's possible to generate chunks of arbitrary sizes and there is a heap overflow with the desired\
  \ size.\n  - The attack starts creating 3 chunks: chunk0 to abuse the overflow, chunk1 to be overflowed and chunk2 so top\
  \ chunk doesn't consolidate the previous ones.\n  - Then, chunk1 is freed and chunk0 is overflowed to the `bk` pointer of\
  \ chunk1 points to: `bk = magic - 0x10`\n  - Then, chunk3 is allocated with the same size as chunk1, which will trigger\
  \ the unsorted bin attack and will modify the value of the global variable, making possible to get the flag.\n- [**https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/31-unsortedbin_attack/0ctf16_zerostorage/index.html**](https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/31-unsortedbin_attack/0ctf16_zerostorage/index.html)\n\
  \  - The merge function is vulnerable because if both indexes passed are the same one it'll realloc on it and then free\
  \ it but returning a pointer to that freed region that can be used.\n  - Therefore, **2 chunks are created**: **chunk0**\
  \ which will be merged with itself and chunk1 to prevent consolidating with the top chunk. Then, the **merge function is\
  \ called with chunk0** twice which will cause a use after free.\n  - Then, the **`view`** function is called with index\
  \ 2 (which the index of the use after free chunk), which will **leak a libc address**.\n  - As the binary has protections\
  \ to only malloc sizes bigger than **`global_max_fast`** so no fastbin is used, an unsorted bin attack is going to be used\
  \ to overwrite the global variable `global_max_fast`.\n  - Then, it's possible to call the edit function with the index\
  \ 2 (the use after free pointer) and overwrite the `bk` pointer to point to `p64(global_max_fast-0x10)`. Then, creating\
  \ a new chunk will use the previously compromised free address (0x20) will **trigger the unsorted bin attack** overwriting\
  \ the `global_max_fast` which a very big value, allowing now to create chunks in fast bins.\n  - Now a **fast bin attack**\
  \ is performed:\n    - First of all it's discovered that it's possible to work with fast **chunks of size 200** in the **`__free_hook`**\
  \ location:\n    - <pre class=\"language-c\"><code class=\"lang-c\">gef➤  p &__free_hook\n      $1 = (void (**)(void *,\
  \ const void *)) 0x7ff1e9e607a8 <__free_hook>\n      gef➤  x/60gx 0x7ff1e9e607a8 - 0x59\n      <strong>0x7ff1e9e6074f: 0x0000000000000000\

  \      0x0000000000000000\n      </code></pre>\n      - If we manage to get a fast chunk of size 0x200 in this location,\
  \ it'll be possible to overwrite a function pointer that will be executed\n    - For this, a new chunk of size `0xfc` is\
  \ created and the merged function is called with that pointer twice, this way we obtain a pointer to a freed chunk of size\
  \ `0xfc*2 = 0x1f8` in the fast bin.\n    - Then, the edit function is called in this chunk to modify the **`fd`** address\
  \ of this fast bin to point to the previous **`__free_hook`** function.\n    - Then, a chunk with size `0x1f8` is created\
  \ to retrieve from the fast bin the previous useless chunk so another chunk of size `0x1f8` is created to get a fast bin\
  \ chunk in the **`__free_hook`** which is overwritten with the address of **`system`** function.\n    - And finally a chunk\
  \ containing the string `/bin/sh\\x00` is freed calling the delete function, triggering the **`__free_hook`** function which\
  \ points to system with `/bin/sh\\x00` as parameter.\n  - **CTF** [**https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/33-custom_misc_heap/csaw19_traveller/index.html**](https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/33-custom_misc_heap/csaw19_traveller/index.html)\n\
  \    - Another example of abusing a 1B overflow to consolidate chunks in the unsorted bin and get a libc infoleak and then\
  \ perform a fast bin attack to overwrite malloc hook with a one gadget address\n- [**Robot Factory. BlackHat MEA CTF 2022**](https://7rocky.github.io/en/ctf/other/blackhat-ctf/robot-factory/)\n\
  \  - We can only allocate chunks of size greater than `0x100`.\n  - Overwrite `global_max_fast` using an Unsorted Bin attack\
  \ (works 1/16 times due to ASLR, because we need to modify 12 bits, but we must modify 16 bits).\n  - Fast Bin attack to\
  \ modify the a global array of chunks. This gives an arbitrary read/write primitive, which allows to modify the GOT and\
  \ set some function to point to `system`.\n\n\n\n## References\n\n- Glibc malloc unsorted-bin integrity checks (example\
