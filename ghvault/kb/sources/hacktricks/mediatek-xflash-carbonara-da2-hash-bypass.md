_body: "# MediaTek XFlash Carbonara DA2 Hash Bypass\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n## Summary\n\n\
  \"Carbonara\" abuses MediaTek's XFlash download path to run a modified Download Agent stage 2 (DA2) despite DA1 integrity\
  \ checks. DA1 stores the expected SHA-256 of DA2 in RAM and compares it before branching. On many loaders, the host fully\
  \ controls the DA2 load address/size, giving an unchecked memory write that can overwrite that in-memory hash and redirect\
  \ execution to arbitrary payloads (pre-OS context with cache invalidation handled by DA).\n\n## Trust boundary in XFlash\
  \ (DA1 → DA2)\n\n- **DA1** is signed/loaded by BootROM/Preloader. When Download Agent Authorization (DAA) is enabled, only\
  \ signed DA1 should run.\n- **DA2** is sent over USB. DA1 receives **size**, **load address**, and **SHA-256** and hashes\
  \ the received DA2, comparing it to an **expected hash embedded in DA1** (copied into RAM).\n- **Weakness:** On unpatched\
  \ loaders, DA1 does not sanitize the DA2 load address/size and keeps the expected hash writable in memory, enabling the\
  \ host to tamper with the check.\n\n## Carbonara flow (\"two BOOT_TO\" trick)\n\n1. **First `BOOT_TO`:** Enter the DA1→DA2\
  \ staging flow (DA1 allocates, prepares DRAM, and exposes the expected-hash buffer in RAM).\n2. **Hash-slot overwrite:**\
  \ Send a small payload that scans DA1 memory for the stored DA2-expected hash and overwrites it with the SHA-256 of the\
  \ attacker-modified DA2. This leverages the user-controlled load to land the payload where the hash resides.\n3. **Second\
  \ `BOOT_TO` + digest:** Trigger another `BOOT_TO` with the patched DA2 metadata and send the raw 32-byte digest matching\
  \ the modified DA2. DA1 recomputes SHA-256 over the received DA2, compares it against the now-patched expected hash, and\
  \ the jump succeeds into attacker code.\n\nBecause load address/size are attacker-controlled, the same primitive can write\
  \ anywhere in memory (not just the hash buffer), enabling early-boot implants, secure-boot bypass helpers, or malicious\
  \ rootkits.\n\n## Minimal PoC pattern (mtkclient-style)\n\n```python\nif self.xsend(self.Cmd.BOOT_TO):\n    payload = bytes.fromhex(\"\
  a4de2200000000002000000000000000\")\n    if self.xsend(payload) and self.status() == 0:\n        import hashlib\n      \
  \  da_hash = hashlib.sha256(self.daconfig.da2).digest()\n        if self.xsend(da_hash):\n            self.status()\n  \
  \          self.info(\"All good!\")\n```\n\n- `payload` replicates the paid-tool blob that patches the expected-hash buffer\
  \ inside DA1.\n- `sha256(...).digest()` sends raw bytes (not hex) so DA1 compares against the patched buffer.\n- DA2 can\
  \ be any attacker-built image; choosing the load address/size allows arbitrary memory placement with cache invalidation\
  \ handled by DA.\n\n## Patch landscape (hardened loaders)\n\n- **Mitigation**: Updated DAs hardcode the DA2 load address\
  \ to `0x40000000` and ignore the address the host supplies, so writes cannot reach the DA1 hash slot (~0x200000 range).\
  \ The hash remains computed but no longer attacker-writable.\n- **Detecting patched DAs**: mtkclient/penumbra scan DA1 for\
  \ patterns indicating the address-hardening; if found, Carbonara is skipped. Old DAs expose writable hash slots (commonly\
  \ around offsets like `0x22dea4` in V5 DA1) and remain exploitable.\n- **V5 vs V6**: Some V6 (XML) loaders still accept\
  \ user-supplied addresses; newer V6 binaries usually enforce the fixed address and are immune to Carbonara unless downgraded.\n\
  \n## Post-Carbonara (heapb8) note\n\nMediaTek patched Carbonara; a newer vulnerability, **heapb8**, targets the DA2 USB\
  \ file download handler on patched V6 loaders, giving code execution even when `boot_to` is hardened. It abuses a heap overflow\
  \ during chunked file transfers to seize DA2 control flow. The exploit is public in Penumbra/mtk-payloads and demonstrates\
  \ that Carbonara fixes do not close all DA attack surface.\n\n## Notes for triage and hardening\n\n- Devices where DA2 address/size\
  \ are unchecked and DA1 keeps the expected hash writable are vulnerable. If a later Preloader/DA enforces address bounds\
  \ or keeps the hash immutable, Carbonara is mitigated.\n- Enabling DAA and ensuring DA1/Preloader validate BOOT_TO parameters\
  \ (bounds + authenticity of DA2) closes the primitive. Closing only the hash patch without bounding the load still leaves\
  \ arbitrary write risk.\n\n## References\n\n- [Carbonara: The MediaTek exploit nobody served](https://shomy.is-a.dev/blog/article/serving-carbonara)\n\
