_body: "# No-exec / NX\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n## Basic Information\n\nThe **No-Execute (NX)**\
  \ bit, also known as **Execute Disable (XD)** in Intel terminology, is a hardware-based security feature designed to **mitigate**\
  \ the effects of **buffer overflow** attacks. When implemented and enabled, it distinguishes between memory regions that\
  \ are intended for **executable code** and those meant for **data**, such as the **stack** and **heap**. The core idea is\
  \ to prevent an attacker from executing malicious code through buffer overflow vulnerabilities by putting the malicious\
  \ code in the stack for example and directing the execution flow to it.\n\nModern operating systems enforce NX through the\
  \ page table attributes that back the ELF program headers. For example, the `PT_GNU_STACK` header combined with the `GNU_PROPERTY_X86_FEATURE_1_SHSTK`\
  \ or `GNU_PROPERTY_X86_FEATURE_1_IBT` properties let the loader know whether the stack should be **RW** or **RWX**. When\
  \ NX is enabled and the binary was linked with a non-executable stack (`-z noexecstack`), any attempt to pivot execution\
  \ into attacker-controlled data pages (stack, heap, mmap'ed buffers, etc.) will raise a fault unless those pages were explicitly\
  \ marked as executable.\n\n### Detecting NX quickly\n\n- `checksec --file ./vuln` will display `NX enabled` or `NX disabled`\
  \ based on the `GNU_STACK` program header.\n- `readelf -W -l ./vuln | grep GNU_STACK` exposes the stack permissions; the\
  \ presence of an `E` flag indicates that the stack is executable. Example:\n\n```bash\n$ readelf -W -l ./vuln | grep GNU_STACK\n\
  \  GNU_STACK      0x000000 0x000000 0x000000 0x000000 0x000000 RW  0x10\n```\n\n- `execstack -q ./vuln` (from `prelink`)\
  \ is handy when auditing large collections of binaries because it prints `X` for binaries that still have an executable\
  \ stack.\n- At runtime, `/proc/<pid>/maps` will show whether an allocation is `rwx`, `rw-`, `r-x`, etc., which is useful\
  \ when verifying JIT engines or custom allocators.\n\n## Bypasses\n\n### Code-reuse primitives\n\nIt's possible to use techniques\
  \ such as [**ROP**](../rop-return-oriented-programing/index.html) **to bypass** this protection by executing chunks of executable\
  \ code already present in the binary. Typical chains include:\n\n- [**Ret2libc**](../rop-return-oriented-programing/ret2lib/index.html)\n\
  - [**Ret2syscall**](../rop-return-oriented-programing/rop-syscall-execv/index.html)\n- [**Ret2dlresolve**](../rop-return-oriented-programing/ret2dlresolve.md)\
  \ when the binary does not import `system`/`execve`\n- [**Ret2csu**](../rop-return-oriented-programing/ret2csu.md) or [**Ret2vdso**](../rop-return-oriented-programing/ret2vdso.md)\
  \ to synthesize syscalls\n- **Ret2...** — any dispatcher that lets you stitch controlled register state with existing executable\
  \ code to invoke syscalls or library gadgets.\n\nThe workflow is usually: (1) leak a code or libc pointer through an info\
  \ leak, (2) resolve function bases, and (3) craft a chain that never needs attacker-controlled executable bytes.\n\n###\
  \ Sigreturn Oriented Programming (SROP)\n\nSROP builds a fake `sigframe` on a writable page and pivots execution to `sys_rt_sigreturn`\
  \ (or the relevant ABI equivalent). The kernel then “restores” the crafted context, instantly granting full control over\
  \ all general-purpose registers, `rip`, and `eflags`. Recent CTF challenges (e.g., the *Hostel* task in n00bzCTF 2023) show\
  \ how SROP chains first invoke `mprotect` to flip the stack to `RWX`, then reuse the same stack for shellcode, effectively\
  \ bypassing NX even when only a single `syscall; ret` gadget is available. Check the dedicated [SROP page](../rop-return-oriented-programing/srop-sigreturn-oriented-programming/README.md)\
  \ for more architecture-specific tricks.\n\n### Ret2mprotect / ret2syscall to flip permissions\n\nIf you can call `mprotect`,\
  \ `pkey_mprotect`, or even `dlopen`, you can legitimately request an executable mapping before running shellcode. A small\
  \ `pwntools` skeleton looks like:\n\n```python\nfrom pwn import *\nelf = ELF(\"./vuln\")\nrop = ROP(elf)\nrop.mprotect(elf.bss(),\
  \ 0x1000, 7)\npayload = flat({offset: rop.chain(), offset+len(rop.chain()): asm(shellcraft.sh())})\n```\n\nThe same idea\
  \ applies to `ret2syscall` chains that set `rax=__NR_mprotect`, point `rdi` to a `mmap`/`.bss` page, store the desired length\
  \ in `rsi`, and set `rdx=7` (`PROT_RWX`). Once a RWX region exists, execution can safely jump into attacker-controlled bytes.\n\
  \n### RWX primitives from JIT engines and kernels\n\nJIT engines, interpreters, GPU drivers, and kernel subsystems that\
  \ dynamically emit code are a common way to regain executable memory even under strict NX policies. The 2024 Linux kernel\
  \ vulnerability **CVE-2024-42067** showed that failures in `set_memory_rox()` left eBPF JIT pages writable *and* executable,\
  \ letting attackers spray gadgets or entire shellcode blobs inside the kernel despite NX/W^X expectations. Exploits that\
  \ gain control over a JIT compiler (BPF, JavaScript, Lua, etc.) can therefore arrange for their payload to live in those\
  \ RWX arenas and only need a single function pointer overwrite to jump into them.\n\n### Non-return code reuse (JOP/COP)\n\
  \nIf `ret` instructions are hardened (e.g., CET/IBT) or the binary lacks expressive `ret` gadgets, pivot to **Jump-Oriented\
  \ Programming (JOP)** or **Call-Oriented Programming (COP)**. These techniques build dispatchers that use `jmp [reg]` or\
  \ `call [reg]` sequences found in the binary or loaded libraries. They still respect NX because they reuse existing executable\
  \ code, but they sidestep mitigations that specifically watch for large chains of `ret` instructions.\n\n{{#ref}}\n../rop-return-oriented-programing/README.md\n\
