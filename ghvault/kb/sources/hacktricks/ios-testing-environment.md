  \ **provisioning identity** is a collection of public and private keys that are associated an Apple developer account. In\
  \ order to **sign apps** you need to pay **99$/year** to register in the **Apple Developer Program** to get your provisioning\
  \ identity. Without this you won't be able to run applications from the source code in a physical device. Another option\
  \ to do this is to use a **jailbroken device**.\n\nStarting in Xcode 7.2 Apple has provided an option to create a **free\
  \ iOS development provisioning profile** that allows to write and test your application on a real iPhone. Go to _Xcode_\
  \ --> _Preferences_ --> _Accounts_ --> _+_ (Add new Appli ID you your credentials) --> _Click on the Apple ID created_ -->\
  \ _Manage Certificates_ --> _+_ (Apple Development) --> _Done_\\\n\\_\\_Then, in order to run your application in your iPhone\
  \ you need first to **indicate the iPhone to trust the computer.** Then, you can try to **run the application in the mobile\
  \ from Xcode,** but and error will appear. So go to _Settings_ --> _General_ --> _Profiles and Device Management_ --> Select\
  \ the untrusted profile and click \"**Trust**\".\n\nOn **iOS 16+**, **Developer Mode** must also be enabled on the device\
  \ before locally installed development-signed applications (or apps re-signed with `get-task-allow`) will run. This option\
  \ only appears **after pairing the device with Xcode** or after installing a development-signed app once. The flow is: **pair\
  \ the device**, trigger an install from Xcode, then enable **Settings** --> **Privacy & Security** --> **Developer Mode**,\
  \ reboot, and confirm the prompt after unlock.\n\nNote that **applications signed by the same signing certificate can share\
  \ resources on a secure manner, like keychain items**.\n\nThe provisioning profiles are stored inside the phone in **`/Library/MobileDevice/ProvisioningProfiles`**\n\
  \n### Modern host-side device tooling\n\nFor current iOS testing, the host tooling is increasingly split between:\n\n- **`xcrun\
  \ simctl`** for simulator management\n- **`xcrun xctrace list devices`** to enumerate simulators and physical devices\n\
  - **`xcrun devicectl`** (Xcode 15+) to interact with paired physical devices from the command line\n\nUseful examples:\n\
  \n```bash\n# List booted simulators\nxcrun simctl list | grep Booted\n\n# List all visible devices/simulators\nxcrun xctrace\
  \ list devices\n\n# List paired physical devices (Xcode 15+)\nxcrun devicectl list devices\n```\n\n`devicectl` is especially\
  \ useful in automation pipelines where you need to install or launch a test build without opening Xcode:\n\n```bash\nxcrun\
  \ devicectl device install app --device <udid> <path_to_app_or_ipa>\nxcrun devicectl device launch app --terminate-existing\
  \ --device <udid> <bundle_id>\n```\n\nKeep Xcode updated when testing **iOS 17+** devices. Apple moved developer services\
  \ to the **CoreDevice** stack and also changed how **Developer Disk Images** are handled, so outdated host tooling frequently\
  \ fails with pairing, image-mounting, or app-launch errors.\n\n## **Simulator**\n\n> [!TIP]\n> Note that a **simulator isn't\
  \ the same as en emulator**. The simulator just simulates the behaviour of the device and functions but don't actually use\
  \ them.\n\n### **Simulator**\n\nThe first thing you need to know is that **performing a pentest inside a simulator will\
  \ much more limited than doing it in a jailbroken device**.\n\nAll the tools required to build and support an iOS app are\
  \ **only officially supported on Mac OS**.\\\nApple's de facto tool for creating/debugging/instrumenting iOS applications\
  \ is **Xcode**. It can be used to download other components such as **simulators** and different **SDK** **versions** required\
  \ to build and **test** your app.\\\nIt's highly recommended to **download** Xcode from the **official app store**. Other\
  \ versions may be carrying malware.\n\nThe simulator files can be found in `/Users/<username>/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Devices`\n\
  \nThe simulator is still very useful for quickly testing **filesystem artifacts**, **NSUserDefaults**, **plist parsing**,\
  \ **custom URL schemes**, and **basic runtime instrumentation**. However, keep in mind that it doesn't emulate several physical-device\
  \ security properties that are often relevant during a pentest, such as the **Secure Enclave**, **baseband**, certain **keychain\
  \ access-control behaviours**, realistic **biometric flows**, and jailbreak-specific execution conditions.\n\nTo open the\
  \ simulator, run Xcode, then press in the _Xcode tab_ --> _Open Developer tools_ --> _Simulator_\\\n\\_\\_In the following\
  \ image clicking in \"iPod touch \\[...]\" you can select other device to test in:\n\n![](<../../images/image (270).png>)\n\
  \n![](<../../images/image (520).png>)\n\n### Applications in the Simulator\n\nInside `/Users/<username>/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Devices`\
  \ you may find all the **installed simulators**. If you want to access the files of an application created inside one of\
  \ the emulators it might be difficult to know **in which one the app is installed**. A quick way to **find the correct UID**\
  \ is to execute the app in the simulator and execute:\n\n```bash\nxcrun simctl list | grep Booted\n    iPhone 8 (BF5DA4F8-6BBE-4EA0-BA16-7E3AFD16C06C)\
  \ (Booted)\n```\n\nOnce you know the UID the apps installed within it can be found in `/Users/<username>/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Devices/{UID}/data/Containers/Data/Application`\n\
  \nHowever, surprisingly you won't find the application here. You need to access `/Users/<username>/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/{Application}/Build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/`\n\
  \nAnd in this folder you can **find the package of the application.**\n\n## Emulator\n\nCorellium is the only publicly available\
  \ iOS emulator. It is an enterprise SaaS solution with a per user license model and does not offer any trial license.\n\n\
  ## No Jailbreak needed\n\nCheck this blog post about how to pentest an iOS application in a **non jailbroken device**:\n\
  \n\n{{#ref}}\nios-pentesting-without-jailbreak.md\n{{#endref}}\n\n## Jailbreaking\n\nApple strictly requires that the code\
  \ running on the iPhone must be **signed by a certificate issued by Apple**. **Jailbreaking** is the process of actively\
  \ **circumventing such restrictions** and other security controls put in places by the OS. Therefore, once the device is\
  \ jailbroken, the **integrity check** which is responsible for checking apps being installed is patched so it is **bypassed**.\n\
  \n> [!TIP]\n> Unlike Android, **you cannot switch to \"Developer Mode\"** in iOS to run unsigned/untrusted code on the device.\n\
  \n### Android Rooting vs. iOS Jailbreaking\n\nWhile often compared, **rooting** on Android and **jailbreaking** on iOS are\
  \ fundamentally different processes. Rooting Android devices might involve **installing the `su` binary** or **replacing\
  \ the system with a rooted custom ROM**, which doesn't necessarily require exploits if the bootloader is unlocked. **Flashing\
  \ custom ROMs** replaces the device's OS after unlocking the bootloader, sometimes requiring an exploit.\n\nIn contrast,\
  \ iOS devices cannot flash custom ROMs due to the bootloader's restriction to only boot Apple-signed images. **Jailbreaking\
  \ iOS** aims to bypass Apple's code signing protections to run unsigned code, a process complicated by Apple's continuous\
  \ security enhancements.\n\n### Jailbreaking Challenges\n\nJailbreaking iOS is increasingly difficult as Apple patches vulnerabilities\
  \ quickly. **Downgrading iOS** is only possible for a limited time after a release, making jailbreaking a time-sensitive\
  \ matter. Devices used for security testing should not be updated unless re-jailbreaking is guaranteed.\n\niOS updates are\
  \ controlled by a **challenge-response mechanism** (SHSH blobs), allowing installation only for Apple-signed responses.\
  \ This mechanism, known as a \"signing window\", limits the ability to store and later use OTA firmware packages. The [IPSW\
  \ Downloads website](https://ipsw.me) is a resource for checking current signing windows.\n\n### Jailbreak Varieties\n\n\
  - **Tethered jailbreaks** require a computer connection for each reboot.\n- **Semi-tethered jailbreaks** allow booting into\
  \ non-jailbroken mode without a computer.\n- **Semi-untethered jailbreaks** require manual re-jailbreaking without needing\
  \ a computer.\n- **Untethered jailbreaks** offer a permanent jailbreak solution without the need for re-application.\n\n\
  ### Jailbreaking Tools and Resources\n\nJailbreaking tools vary by iOS version and device. Resources such as [Can I Jailbreak?](https://canijailbreak.com),\
  \ [The iPhone Wiki](https://www.theiphonewiki.com), and [Reddit Jailbreak](https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/) provide\
  \ up-to-date information. Examples include:\n\n- [Checkra1n](https://checkra.in/) for older A7-A11/iOS 12-14 era research\
  \ devices.\n- [Palera1n](https://palera.in/) for checkm8-compatible devices (A8-A11) on iOS/iPadOS 15+.\n- [Dopamine](https://github.com/opa334/Dopamine)\
  \ for many arm64/arm64e devices on iOS 15/16 using a modern rootless jailbreak.\n- [Unc0ver](https://unc0ver.dev/) remains\
  \ relevant mainly for older iOS versions up to 14.8.\n\nModifying your device carries risks, and jailbreaking should be\
  \ approached with caution.\n\n### Rootless jailbreaks\n\nModern iOS 15+ jailbreaks are commonly **rootless** instead of\
  \ **rootful**. From a tester perspective, this matters because a lot of older guides still assume that jailbreak files live\
  \ directly under `/` or `/Library/...`, which is no longer true on many current setups.\n\n- Rootless jailbreaks avoid modifying\
  \ the sealed system volume directly.\n- On palera1n, jailbreak files are typically stored under a randomized path in `/private/preboot/...`\
  \ and exposed through the stable symlink **`/var/jb`**.\n- Tweaks, launch daemons, and helper binaries might therefore exist\
  \ under **`/var/jb`** instead of the legacy rootful locations.\n\nThis has a direct impact on **environment validation**,\
  \ **Frida setup**, and **jailbreak detection bypass**:\n\n- When checking whether your tooling installed correctly, inspect\
  \ both legacy paths and **`/var/jb`**.\n- When reviewing jailbreak detection logic in an app, remember that modern checks\
  \ often look for **rootless** artifacts and symlinks in addition to classic indicators like `Cydia.app`.\n- If a third-party\
  \ script or tweak assumes a rootful filesystem layout, it may fail silently on a rootless device.\n\n### Jailbreaking Benefits\
  \ and Risks\n\nJailbreaking **removes OS-imposed sandboxing**, allowing apps to access the entire filesystem. This freedom\
  \ enables the installation of unapproved apps and access to more APIs. However, for regular users, jailbreaking is **not\
  \ recommended** due to potential security risks and device instability.\n\n### **After Jailbreaking**\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nbasic-ios-testing-operations.md\n\
  {{#endref}}\n\n### **Jailbreak Detection**\n\n**Several applications will try to detect if the mobile is jailbroken and\
  \ in that case the application won't run**\n\n- After jailbreaking an iOS **files and folders are usually installed**, these\
  \ can be searched to determine if the device is jailbroken.\n- In modern **rootless** jailbreaks, those files may appear\
  \ under **`/var/jb`** or resolve through symlinks into `/private/preboot/...` instead of only in classic rootful locations.\n\
  - In a jailbroken device applications get **read/write access to new files** outside the sandbox\n- Some **API** **calls**\
  \ will **behave differently**\n- The presence of the **OpenSSH** service\n- Calling `/bin/sh` will **return 1** instead\
  \ of 0\n\n**More information about how to detect jailbreaking** [**here**](https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/jailbreak-detection-methods/)**.**\n\
  \nYou can try to avoid this detections using **objection's** `ios jailbreak disable`\n\n## **Jailbreak Detection Bypass**\n\
  \n- You can try to avoid this detections using **objection's** `ios jailbreak disable`\n- You could also install the tool\
  \ **Liberty Lite** (https://ryleyangus.com/repo/). Once the repo is added, the app should appear in the ‘Search’ tab\n\n\
