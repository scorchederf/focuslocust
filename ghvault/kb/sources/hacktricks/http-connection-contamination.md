_body: "# HTTP Connection Contamination\n\n{{#include ../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n**This is a summary of the post:\
  \ [https://portswigger.net/research/http-3-connection-contamination](https://portswigger.net/research/http-3-connection-contamination)**.\
  \ Check it for further details!\n\nWeb browsers can reuse a single HTTP/2+ connection for different websites through [HTTP\
  \ connection coalescing](https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2016/08/18/http2-connection-coalescing), given shared IP addresses\
  \ and a common TLS certificate. However, this can conflict with **first-request routing** in reverse-proxies, where subsequent\
  \ requests are directed to the back-end determined by the first request. This misrouting can lead to security vulnerabilities,\
  \ particularly when combined with wildcard TLS certificates and domains like `*.example.com`.\n\nFor example, if `wordpress.example.com`\
  \ and `secure.example.com` are both served by the same reverse proxy and have a common wildcard certificate, a browser's\
  \ connection coalescing could lead requests to `secure.example.com` to be wrongly processed by the WordPress back-end, exploiting\
  \ vulnerabilities such as XSS.\n\nTo observe connection coalescing, Chrome's Network tab or tools like Wireshark can be\
  \ used. Here's a snippet for testing:\n\n```javascript\nfetch(\"//sub1.hackxor.net/\", { mode: \"no-cors\", credentials:\
  \ \"include\" }).then(\n  () => {\n    fetch(\"//sub2.hackxor.net/\", { mode: \"no-cors\", credentials: \"include\" })\n\
  \  }\n)\n```\n\nThe threat is currently limited due to the rarity of first-request routing and the complexity of HTTP/2.\
  \ However, the proposed changes in HTTP/3, which relax the IP address match requirement, could broaden the attack surface,\
  \ making servers with a wildcard certificate more vulnerable without needing a MITM attack.\n\nBest practices include avoiding\
  \ first-request routing in reverse proxies and being cautious with wildcard TLS certificates, especially with the advent\
  \ of HTTP/3. Regular testing and awareness of these complex, interconnected vulnerabilities are crucial for maintaining\
  \ web security.\n\n{{#include ../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}"
