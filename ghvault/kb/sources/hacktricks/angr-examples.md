  \ th stack to find out the vallue that stack position need to\n# have to reach a rogram flow\n\nimport angr\nimport claripy\n\
  import sys\n\ndef main(argv):\n  path_to_binary = argv[1]\n  project = angr.Project(path_to_binary)\n\n  # Go to some address\
  \ after the scanf where values have already being set in the stack\n  start_address = 0x8048697\n  initial_state = project.factory.blank_state(addr=start_address)\n\
  \n  # Since we are starting after scanf, we are skipping this stack construction\n  # step. To make up for this, we need\
  \ to construct the stack ourselves. Let us\n  # start by initializing ebp in the exact same way the program does.\n  initial_state.regs.ebp\
  \ = initial_state.regs.esp\n\n  # In this case scanf(\"%u %u\") is used, so 2 BVS are going to be needed\n  password0 =\
  \ claripy.BVS('password0', 32)\n  password1 = claripy.BVS('password1', 32)\n\n  # Now, in the address were you have stopped,\
  \ check were are the scanf values saved\n  # Then, substrack form the esp registry the needing padding to get to the\n \
  \ # part of the stack were the scanf values are being saved and push the BVS\n  # (see the image below to understan this\
  \ -8)\n  padding_length_in_bytes = 8  # :integer\n  initial_state.regs.esp -= padding_length_in_bytes\n\n  initial_state.stack_push(password0)\n\
  \  initial_state.stack_push(password1)\n\n  simulation = project.factory.simgr(initial_state)\n\n  def is_successful(state):\n\
  \    stdout_output = state.posix.dumps(sys.stdout.fileno())\n    return 'Good Job.'.encode() in stdout_output\n\n  def should_abort(state):\n\

  \    print(solution)\n  else:\n    raise Exception('Could not find the solution')\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n  main(sys.argv)\n\
  ```\n\nIn this scenario, the input was taken with `scanf(\"%u %u\")` and the value `\"1 1\"` was given, so the values **`0x00000001`**\
  \ of the stack come from the **user input**. You can see how this values starts in `$ebp - 8`. Therefore, in the code we\
  \ have **subtracted 8 bytes to `$esp` (as in that moment `$ebp` and `$esp` had the same value)** and then we have pushed\
  \ the BVS.\n\n![](<../../../images/image (136).png>)\n\n### Static Memory values (Global variables)\n\n```python\nimport\

  \ number of characters)\n>  # In order to represent this in memory, we would want to write the string to\n>  # the beginning\
  \ of the file:\n>  #\n>  # hello_txt_contents = claripy.BVV('Hello world, my name is John.', 30*8)\n>  #\n>  # Perhaps,\
  \ then, we would want to replace John with a\n>  # symbolic variable. We would call:\n>  #\n>  # name_bitvector = claripy.BVS('symbolic_name',\
  \ 4*8)\n>  #\n>  # Then, after the program calls fopen('hello.txt', 'r') and then\n>  # fread(buffer, sizeof(char), 30,\
  \ hello_txt_file), the buffer would contain\n>  # the string from the file, except four symbolic bytes where the name would\
  \ be\n>  # stored.\n>  # (!)\n> ```\n\n### Applying Constrains\n\n> [!TIP]\n> Sometimes simple human operations like compare\
  \ 2 words of length 16 **char by char** (loop), **cost** a lot to a **angr** because it needs to generate branches **exponentially**\
  \ because it generates 1 branch per if: `2^16`\\\n> Therefore, it's easier to **ask angr get to a previous point** (where\
  \ the real difficult part was already done) and **set those constrains manually**.\n\n```python\n# After perform some complex\
  \ poperations to the input the program checks\n# char by char the password against another password saved, like in the snippet:\n\
  #\n# #define REFERENCE_PASSWORD = \"AABBCCDDEEFFGGHH\";\n# int check_equals_AABBCCDDEEFFGGHH(char* to_check, size_t length)\
  \ {\n#   uint32_t num_correct = 0;\n#   for (int i=0; i<length; ++i) {\n#     if (to_check[i] == REFERENCE_PASSWORD[i])\
  \ {\n#       num_correct += 1;\n#     }\n#   }\n#   return num_correct == length;\n# }\n#\n# ...\n#\n# char* input = user_input();\n\
  # char* encrypted_input = complex_function(input);\n# if (check_equals_AABBCCDDEEFFGGHH(encrypted_input, 16)) {\n#   puts(\"\
  Good Job.\");\n# } else {\n#   puts(\"Try again.\");\n# }\n#\n# The function checks if *to_check == \"AABBCCDDEEFFGGHH\"\
  . This is very RAM consumming\n# as the computer needs to branch every time the if statement in the loop was called (16\n\
  # times), resulting in 2^16 = 65,536 branches, which will take too long of a\n# time to evaluate for our needs.\n\nimport\
