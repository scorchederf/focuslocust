  \ via Ports\n\n### Basic Information\n\nMach uses **tasks** as the **smallest unit** for sharing resources, and each task\
  \ can contain **multiple threads**. These **tasks and threads are mapped 1:1 to POSIX processes and threads**.\n\nCommunication\
  \ between tasks occurs via Mach Inter-Process Communication (IPC), utilising one-way communication channels. **Messages\
  \ are transferred between ports**, which act kind of **message queues** managed by the kernel.\n\nA **port** is the **basic**\
  \ element of Mach IPC. It can be used to **send messages and to receive** them.\n\nEach process has an **IPC table**, in\
  \ there it's possible to find the **mach ports of the process**. The name of a mach port is actually a number (a pointer\
  \ to the kernel object).\n\nA process can also send a port name with some rights **to a different task** and the kernel\
  \ will make this entry in the **IPC table of the other task** appear.\n\n### Port Rights\n\nPort rights, which define what\
  \ operations a task can perform, are key to this communication. The possible **port rights** are ([definitions from here](https://docs.darlinghq.org/internals/macos-specifics/mach-ports.html)):\n\
  \n- **Receive right**, which allows receiving messages sent to the port. Mach ports are MPSC (multiple-producer, single-consumer)\
  \ queues, which means that there may only ever be **one receive right for each port** in the whole system (unlike with pipes,\
  \ where multiple processes can all hold file descriptors to the read end of one pipe).\n  - A **task with the Receive**\
  \ right can receive messages and **create Send rights**, allowing it to send messages. Originally only the **own task has\
  \ Receive right over its por**t.\n  - If the owner of the Receive right **dies** or kills it, the **send right becomes useless\
  \ (dead name).**\n- **Send right**, which allows sending messages to the port.\n  - The Send right can be **cloned** so\
  \ a task owning a Send right can clone the right and **grant it to a third task**.\n  - Note that **port rights** can also\
  \ be **passed** though Mac messages.\n- **Send-once right**, which allows sending one message to the port and then disappears.\n\
  \  - This right **cannot** be **cloned**, but it can be **moved**.\n- **Port set right**, which denotes a _port set_ rather\
  \ than a single port. Dequeuing a message from a port set dequeues a message from one of the ports it contains. Port sets\
  \ can be used to listen on several ports simultaneously, a lot like `select`/`poll`/`epoll`/`kqueue` in Unix.\n- **Dead\
  \ name**, which is not an actual port right, but merely a placeholder. When a port is destroyed, all existing port rights\
  \ to the port turn into dead names.\n\n**Tasks can transfer SEND rights to others**, enabling them to send messages back.\
  \ **SEND rights can also be cloned, so a task can duplicate and give the right to a third task**. This, combined with an\
  \ intermediary process known as the **bootstrap server**, allows for effective communication between tasks.\n\n### File\
  \ Ports\n\nFile ports allows to encapsulate file descriptors in Mac ports (using Mach port rights). It's possible to create\
  \ a `fileport` from a given FD using `fileport_makeport` and create a FD froma. fileport using `fileport_makefd`.\n\n###\
  \ Establishing a communication\n\nAs mentioned previously, it's possible to send rights using Mach messages, however, you\
  \ **cannot send a right without already having a right** to send a Mach message. So, how is the first communication stablished?\n\
  \nFor this, he **bootstrap server** (**launchd** in mac) is involved, as **everyone can get a SEND right to the bootstrap\
  \ server**, it's possible to ask it for a right to send a message to another process:\n\n1. Task **A** creates a **new port**,\
  \ getting the **RECEIVE right** over it.\n2. Task **A**, being the holder of the RECEIVE right, **generates a SEND right\
  \ for the port**.\n3. Task **A** establishes a **connection** with the **bootstrap server**, and **sends it the SEND right**\
  \ for the port it generated at the beginning.\n   - Remember that anyone can get a SEND right to the bootstrap server.\n\
  4. Task A sends a `bootstrap_register` message to the bootstrap server to **associate the given port with a name** like\
  \ `com.apple.taska`\n5. Task **B** interacts with the **bootstrap server** to execute a bootstrap **lookup for the service**\
  \ name (`bootstrap_lookup`). So the bootstrap server can respond, task B will send it a **SEND right to a port it previously\
  \ created** inside the lookup message. If the lookup is successful, the **server duplicates the SEND right** received from\
  \ Task A and **transmits it to Task B**.\n   - Remember that anyone can get a SEND right to the bootstrap server.\n6. With\
  \ this SEND right, **Task B** is capable of **sending** a **message** **to Task A**.\n7. For a bi-directional communication\
  \ usually task **B** generates a new port with a **RECEIVE** right and a **SEND** right, and gives the **SEND right to Task\
  \ A** so it can send messages to TASK B (bi-directional communication).\n\nThe bootstrap server **cannot authenticate**\
  \ the service name claimed by a task. This means a **task** could potentially **impersonate any system task**, such as falsely\
  \ **claiming an authorization service name** and then approving every request.\n\nThen, Apple stores the **names of system-provided\
  \ services** in secure configuration files, located in **SIP-protected** directories: `/System/Library/LaunchDaemons` and\
  \ `/System/Library/LaunchAgents`. Alongside each service name, the **associated binary is also stored**. The bootstrap server,\
  \ will create and hold a **RECEIVE right for each of these service names**.\n\nFor these predefined services, the **lookup\
  \ process differs slightly**. When a service name is being looked up, launchd starts the service dynamically. The new workflow\
  \ is as follows:\n\n- Task **B** initiates a bootstrap **lookup** for a service name.\n- **launchd** checks if the task\
  \ is running and if it isn’t, **starts** it.\n- Task **A** (the service) performs a **bootstrap check-in** (`bootstrap_check_in()`).\
  \ Here, the **bootstrap** server creates a SEND right, retains it, and **transfers the RECEIVE right to Task A**.\n- launchd\
  \ duplicates the **SEND right and sends it to Task B**.\n- Task **B** generates a new port with a **RECEIVE** right and\
  \ a **SEND** right, and gives the **SEND right to Task A** (the svc) so it can send messages to TASK B (bi-directional communication).\n\
  \nHowever, this process only applies to predefined system tasks. Non-system tasks still operate as described originally,\
  \ which could potentially allow for impersonation.\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n> Therefore, launchd should never crash or the whole\
  \ sysem will crash.\n\n### A Mach Message\n\n[Find more info here](https://sector7.computest.nl/post/2023-10-xpc-audit-token-spoofing/)\n\
  \nThe `mach_msg` function, essentially a system call, is utilized for sending and receiving Mach messages. The function\
  \ requires the message to be sent as the initial argument. This message must commence with a `mach_msg_header_t` structure,\
  \ succeeded by the actual message content. The structure is defined as follows:\n\n```c\ntypedef struct {\n\tmach_msg_bits_t\
  \               msgh_bits;\n\tmach_msg_size_t               msgh_size;\n\tmach_port_t                   msgh_remote_port;\n\
  \tmach_port_t                   msgh_local_port;\n\tmach_port_name_t              msgh_voucher_port;\n\tmach_msg_id_t  \
  \               msgh_id;\n} mach_msg_header_t;\n```\n\nProcesses possessing a _**receive right**_ can receive messages on\
  \ a Mach port. Conversely, the **senders** are granted a _**send**_ or a _**send-once right**_. The send-once right is exclusively\
  \ for sending a single message, after which it becomes invalid.\n\nThe initial field **`msgh_bits`** is a bitmap:\n\n- First\
  \ bit (most significative) is used to indicate that a message is complex (more on this below)\n- The 3rd and 4th are used\
  \ by the kernel\n- The **5 least significant bits of the 2nd byte** from can be used for **voucher**: another type of port\
  \ to send key/value combinations.\n- The **5 least significant bits of the 3rd byte** from can be used for **local port**\n\
  - The **5 least significant bits of the 4th byte** from can be used for **remote port**\n\nThe types that can be specified\
  \ in the voucher, local and remote ports are (from [**mach/message.h**](https://opensource.apple.com/source/xnu/xnu-7195.81.3/osfmk/mach/message.h.auto.html)):\n\
  \n```c\n#define MACH_MSG_TYPE_MOVE_RECEIVE      16      /* Must hold receive right */\n#define MACH_MSG_TYPE_MOVE_SEND \
  \        17      /* Must hold send right(s) */\n#define MACH_MSG_TYPE_MOVE_SEND_ONCE    18      /* Must hold sendonce right\
  \ */\n#define MACH_MSG_TYPE_COPY_SEND         19      /* Must hold send right(s) */\n#define MACH_MSG_TYPE_MAKE_SEND   \
  \      20      /* Must hold receive right */\n#define MACH_MSG_TYPE_MAKE_SEND_ONCE    21      /* Must hold receive right\
  \ */\n#define MACH_MSG_TYPE_COPY_RECEIVE      22      /* NOT VALID */\n#define MACH_MSG_TYPE_DISPOSE_RECEIVE   24      /*\
  \ must hold receive right */\n#define MACH_MSG_TYPE_DISPOSE_SEND      25      /* must hold send right(s) */\n#define MACH_MSG_TYPE_DISPOSE_SEND_ONCE\
  \ 26      /* must hold sendonce right */\n```\n\nFor example, `MACH_MSG_TYPE_MAKE_SEND_ONCE` can be used to **indicate**\
  \ that a **send-once** **right** should be derived and transferred for this port. It can also be specified `MACH_PORT_NULL`\
  \ to prevent the recipient to be able to reply.\n\nIn order to achieve an easy **bi-directional communication** a process\
  \ can specify a **mach port** in the mach **message header** called the _reply port_ (**`msgh_local_port`**) where the **receiver**\
  \ of the message can **send a reply** to this message.\n\n> [!TIP]\n> Note that this kind of bi-directional communication\
  \ is used in XPC messages that expect a replay (`xpc_connection_send_message_with_reply` and `xpc_connection_send_message_with_reply_sync`).\
  \ But **usually different ports are created** as explained previously to create the bi-directional communication.\n\nThe\
  \ other fields of the message header are:\n\n- `msgh_size`: the size of the entire packet.\n- `msgh_remote_port`: the port\
  \ on which this message is sent.\n- `msgh_voucher_port`: [mach vouchers](https://robert.sesek.com/2023/6/mach_vouchers.html).\n\
  - `msgh_id`: the ID of this message, which is interpreted by the receiver.\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n> Note that **mach messages\
  \ are sent over a `mach port`**, which is a **single receiver**, **multiple sender** communication channel built into the\
  \ mach kernel. **Multiple processes** can **send messages** to a mach port, but at any point only **a single process can\
  \ read** from it.\n\nMessages are then formed by the **`mach_msg_header_t`** header followed by the **body** and by the\
  \ **trailer** (if any) and it can grant permission to reply to it. In these cases, the kernel just need to pass the message\
  \ from one task to the other.\n\nA **trailer** is **information added to the message by the kernel** (cannot be set by the\
  \ user) which can be requested in message reception with the flags `MACH_RCV_TRAILER_<trailer_opt>` (there is different\
  \ information that can be requested).\n\n#### Complex Messages\n\nHowever, there are other more **complex** messages, like\
  \ the ones passing additional port rights or sharing memory, where the kernel also needs to send these objects to the recipient.\
  \ In this cases the most significant bit of the header `msgh_bits` is set.\n\nThe possible descriptors to pass are defined\
  \ in [**`mach/message.h`**](https://opensource.apple.com/source/xnu/xnu-7195.81.3/osfmk/mach/message.h.auto.html):\n\n```c\n\
  #define MACH_MSG_PORT_DESCRIPTOR                0\n#define MACH_MSG_OOL_DESCRIPTOR                 1\n#define MACH_MSG_OOL_PORTS_DESCRIPTOR\
  \           2\n#define MACH_MSG_OOL_VOLATILE_DESCRIPTOR        3\n#define MACH_MSG_GUARDED_PORT_DESCRIPTOR        4\n\n\
  #pragma pack(push, 4)\n\ntypedef struct{\n\tnatural_t                     pad1;\n\tmach_msg_size_t               pad2;\n\
  \tunsigned int                  pad3 : 24;\n\tmach_msg_descriptor_type_t    type : 8;\n} mach_msg_type_descriptor_t;\n```\n\
  \nIn 32bits, all the descriptors are 12B and the descriptor type is in the 11th one. In 64 bits, the sizes vary.\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n\
  > The kernel will copy the descriptors from one task to the other but first **creating a copy in kernel memory**. This technique,\
  \ known as \"Feng Shui\" has been abused in several exploits to make the **kernel copy data in its memory** making a process\
  \ send descriptors to itself. Then the process can receive the messages (the kernel will free them).\n>\n> It's also possible\
  \ to **send port rights to a vulnerable process**, and the port rights will just appear in the process (even if he isn't\
  \ handling them).\n\n### Mac Ports APIs\n\nNote that ports are associated to the task namespace, so to create or search\
  \ for a port, the task namespace is also queried (more in `mach/mach_port.h`):\n\n- **`mach_port_allocate` | `mach_port_construct`**:\
  \ **Create** a port.\n  - `mach_port_allocate` can also create a **port set**: receive right over a group of ports. Whenever\
  \ a message is received it's indicated the port from where it was.\n- `mach_port_allocate_name`: Change the name of the\
  \ port (by default 32bit integer)\n- `mach_port_names`: Get port names from a target\n- `mach_port_type`: Get rights of\
  \ a task over a name\n- `mach_port_rename`: Rename a port (like dup2 for FDs)\n- `mach_port_allocate`: Allocate a new RECEIVE,\
  \ PORT_SET or DEAD_NAME\n- `mach_port_insert_right`: Create a new right in a port where you have RECEIVE\n- `mach_port_...`\n\
  - **`mach_msg`** | **`mach_msg_overwrite`**: Functions used to **send and receive mach messages**. The overwrite version\
  \ allows to specify a different buffer for message reception (the other version will just reuse it).\n\n### Debug mach_msg\n\
  \nAs the functions **`mach_msg`** and **`mach_msg_overwrite`** are the ones used to send a receive messages, setting a breakpoint\
  \ on them would allow to inspect the sent a received messages.\n\nFor example start debugging any application you can debug\
  \ as it will load **`libSystem.B` which will use this function**.\n\n<pre class=\"language-armasm\"><code class=\"lang-armasm\"\

  \nThe **name** is the default name given to the port (check how it's **increasing** in the first 3 bytes). The **`ipc-object`**\
  \ is the **obfuscated** unique **identifier** of the port.\\\nNote also how the ports with only **`send`** right are **identifying\
  \ the owner** of it (port name + pid).\\\nAlso note the use of **`+`** to indicate **other tasks connected to the same port**.\n\
  \nIt's also possible to use [**procesxp**](https://www.newosxbook.com/tools/procexp.html) to see also the **registered service\
  \ names** (with SIP disabled due to the need of `com.apple.system-task-port`):\n\n```\nprocesp 1 ports\n```\n\nYou can install\

  \n## Privileged Ports\n\nThere are some special ports that allows to **perform certain sensitive actions or access certain\
  \ sensitive data** in case a tasks have the **SEND** permissions over them. This makes these ports very interesting from\
  \ an attackers perspective not only because of the capabilities but because it's possible to **share SEND permissions across\
  \ tasks**.\n\n### Host Special Ports\n\nThese ports are represented by a number.\n\n**SEND** rights can be obtained by calling\
  \ **`host_get_special_port`** and **RECEIVE** rights calling **`host_set_special_port`**. However, both calls require the\
  \ **`host_priv`** port which only root can access. Moreover, in the past root was able to call **`host_set_special_port`**\
  \ and hijack arbitrary that allowed for example to bypass code signatures by hijacking `HOST_KEXTD_PORT` (SIP now prevents\
  \ this).\n\nThese are divided in 2 groups: The **first 7 ports are owned by the kernel** being the 1 `HOST_PORT`, the 2\
  \ `HOST_PRIV_PORT` , the 3 `HOST_IO_MASTER_PORT` and the 7 is `HOST_MAX_SPECIAL_KERNEL_PORT`.\\\nThe ones starting **from**\
  \ the number **8** are **owned by system daemons** and they can be found declared in [**`host_special_ports.h`**](https://opensource.apple.com/source/xnu/xnu-4570.1.46/osfmk/mach/host_special_ports.h.auto.html).\n\
  \n- **Host port**: If a process has **SEND** privilege over this port he can get **information** about the **system** calling\
  \ its routines like:\n  - `host_processor_info`: Get processor info\n  - `host_info`: Get host info\n  - `host_virtual_physical_table_info`:\
  \ Virtual/Physical page table (requires MACH_VMDEBUG)\n  - `host_statistics`: Get host statistics\n  - `mach_memory_info`:\
  \ Get kernel memory layout\n- **Host Priv port**: A process with **SEND** right over this port can perform **privileged\
  \ actions** like showing boot data or trying to load a kernel extension. The **process need to be root** to get this permission.\n\
  \  - Moreover, in order to call **`kext_request`** API it's needed to have other entitlements **`com.apple.private.kext*`**\
  \ which are only given to Apple binaries.\n  - Other routines that can be called are:\n    - `host_get_boot_info`: Get `machine_boot_info()`\n\
  \    - `host_priv_statistics`: Get privileged statistics\n    - `vm_allocate_cpm`: Allocate Contiguous Physical Memory\n\
  \    - `host_processors`: Send right to host processors\n    - `mach_vm_wire`: Make memory resident\n  - As **root** can\
  \ access this permission, it could call `host_set_[special/exception]_port[s]` to **hijack host special or exception ports**.\n\
  \nIt's possible to **see all the host special ports** by running:\n\n```bash\nprocexp all ports | grep \"HSP\"\n```\n\n\
  ### Task Special Ports\n\nThese are ports reserved for well known services. It's possible to get/set them calling `task_[get/set]_special_port`.\
  \ They can be found in `task_special_ports.h`:\n\n```c\ntypedef\tint\ttask_special_port_t;\n\n#define TASK_KERNEL_PORT\t\
  1\t/* Represents task to the outside\n\t\t\t\t\t   world.*/\n#define TASK_HOST_PORT\t\t2\t/* The host (priv) port for task.\
  \  */\n#define TASK_BOOTSTRAP_PORT\t4\t/* Bootstrap environment for task. */\n#define TASK_WIRED_LEDGER_PORT\t5\t/* Wired\
  \ resource ledger for task. */\n#define TASK_PAGED_LEDGER_PORT\t6\t/* Paged resource ledger for task. */\n```\n\nFrom [here](https://web.mit.edu/darwin/src/modules/xnu/osfmk/man/task_get_special_port.html):\n\
  \n- **TASK_KERNEL_PORT**\\[task-self send right]: The port used to control this task. Used to send messages that affect\
  \ the task. This is the port returned by **mach_task_self (see Task Ports below)**.\n- **TASK_BOOTSTRAP_PORT**\\[bootstrap\
  \ send right]: The task's bootstrap port. Used to send messages requesting return of other system service ports.\n- **TASK_HOST_NAME_PORT**\\\
  [host-self send right]: The port used to request information of the containing host. This is the port returned by **mach_host_self**.\n\
  - **TASK_WIRED_LEDGER_PORT**\\[ledger send right]: The port naming the source from which this task draws its wired kernel\
  \ memory.\n- **TASK_PAGED_LEDGER_PORT**\\[ledger send right]: The port naming the source from which this task draws its\
  \ default memory managed memory.\n\n### Task Ports\n\nOriginally Mach didn't have \"processes\" it had \"tasks\" which was\
  \ considered more like a container of threads. When Mach was merged with BSD **each task was correlated with a BSD process**.\
  \ Therefore every BSD process has the details it needs to be a process and every Mach task also have its inner workings\
  \ (except for the inexistent pid 0 which is the `kernel_task`).\n\nThere are two very interesting functions related to this:\n\
  \n- `task_for_pid(target_task_port, pid, &task_port_of_pid)`: Get a SEND right for the task por of the task related to the\
  \ specified by the `pid` and give it to the indicated `target_task_port` (which is usually the caller task which has used\
  \ `mach_task_self()`, but could be a SEND port over a different task.)\n- `pid_for_task(task, &pid)`: Given a SEND right\
  \ to a task, find to which PID this task is related to.\n\nIn order to perform actions within the task, the task needed\
  \ a `SEND` right to itself calling `mach_task_self()` (which uses the `task_self_trap` (28)). With this permission a task\
  \ can perform several actions like:\n\n- `task_threads`: Get SEND right over all task ports of the threads of the task\n\
  - `task_info`: Get info about a task\n- `task_suspend/resume`: Suspend or resume a task\n- `task_[get/set]_special_port`\n\
  - `thread_create`: Create a thread\n- `task_[get/set]_state`: Control task state\n- and more can be found in [**mach/task.h**](https://github.com/phracker/MacOSX-SDKs/blob/master/MacOSX11.3.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks/Kernel.framework/Versions/A/Headers/mach/task.h)\n\
  \n> [!CAUTION]\n> Notice that with a SEND right over a task port of a **different task**, it's possible to perform such\
  \ actions over a different task.\n\nMoreover, the task_port is also the **`vm_map`** port which allows to **read an manipulate\
  \ memory** inside a task with functions such as `vm_read()` and `vm_write()`. This basically means that a task with SEND\
  \ rights over the task_port of a different task is going to be able to **inject code into that task**.\n\nRemember that\
  \ because the **kernel is also a task**, if someone manages to get a **SEND permissions** over the **`kernel_task`**, it'll\
  \ be able to make the kernel execute anything (jailbreaks).\n\n- Call `mach_task_self()` to **get the name** for this port\
  \ for the caller task. This port is only **inherited** across **`exec()`**; a new task created with `fork()` gets a new\
  \ task port (as a special case, a task also gets a new task port after `exec()`in a suid binary). The only way to spawn\
  \ a task and get its port is to perform the [\"port swap dance\"](https://robert.sesek.com/2014/1/changes_to_xnu_mach_ipc.html)\
  \ while doing a `fork()`.\n- These are the restrictions to access the port (from `macos_task_policy` from the binary `AppleMobileFileIntegrity`):\n\
  \  - If the app has **`com.apple.security.get-task-allow` entitlement** processes from the **same user can access the task\
  \ port** (commonly added by Xcode for debugging). The **notarization** process won't allow it to production releases.\n\
  \  - Apps with the **`com.apple.system-task-ports`** entitlement can get the **task port for any** process, except the kernel.\
  \ In older versions it was called **`task_for_pid-allow`**. This is only granted to Apple applications.\n  - **Root can\
  \ access task ports** of applications **not** compiled with a **hardened** runtime (and not from Apple).\n\n**The task name\
  \ port:** An unprivileged version of the _task port_. It references the task, but does not allow controlling it. The only\
  \ thing that seems to be available through it is `task_info()`.\n\n### Thread Ports\n\nThreads also have associated ports,\
  \ which are visible from the task calling **`task_threads`** and from the processor with `processor_set_threads`. A SEND\
  \ right to the thread port allows to use the function from the `thread_act` subsystem, like:\n\n- `thread_terminate`\n-\
  \ `thread_[get/set]_state`\n- `act_[get/set]_state`\n- `thread_[suspend/resume]`\n- `thread_info`\n- ...\n\nAny thread can\
  \ get this port calling to **`mach_thread_sef`**.\n\n### Shellcode Injection in thread via Task port\n\nYou can grab a shellcode\

  \ writable memory executable.\n\n### Dylib Injection in thread via Task port\n\nIn macOS **threads** might be manipulated\
  \ via **Mach** or using **posix `pthread` api**. The thread we generated in the previous injection, was generated using\
  \ Mach api, so **it's not posix compliant**.\n\nIt was possible to **inject a simple shellcode** to execute a command because\
  \ it **didn't need to work with posix** compliant apis, only with Mach. **More complex injections** would need the **thread**\
  \ to be also **posix compliant**.\n\nTherefore, to **improve the thread** it should call **`pthread_create_from_mach_thread`**\
  \ which will **create a valid pthread**. Then, this new pthread could **call dlopen** to **load a dylib** from the system,\
  \ so instead of writing new shellcode to perform different actions it's possible to load custom libraries.\n\nYou can find\
  \ **example dylibs** in (for example the one that generates a log and then you can listen to it):\n\n\n{{#ref}}\n../macos-library-injection/macos-dyld-hijacking-and-dyld_insert_libraries.md\n\

  \n### Thread Hijacking via Task port <a href=\"#step-1-thread-hijacking\" id=\"step-1-thread-hijacking\"></a>\n\nIn this\
  \ technique a thread of the process is hijacked:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nmacos-thread-injection-via-task-port.md\n{{#endref}}\n\n\
  ### Task Port Injection Detection\n\nWhen calling `task_for_pid` or `thread_create_*` increments a counter in the struct\
  \ task from the kernel which can by accessed from user mode calling task_info(task, TASK_EXTMOD_INFO, ...)\n\n## Exception\
  \ Ports\n\nWhen a exception occurs in a thread, this exception is sent to the designated exception port of the thread. If\
  \ the thread doesn't handle it, then it's sent to the task exception ports. If the task doesn't handle it, then it's sent\
  \ to the host port which is managed by launchd (where it'll be acknowledge). This is called exception triage.\n\nNote that\
  \ at the end usually if not properly handle the report will end up being handle by the ReportCrash daemon. However, it's\
  \ possible for another thread in the same task to manage the exception, this is what crash reporting tools like `PLCreashReporter`\
  \ does.\n\n## Other Objects\n\n### Clock\n\nAny user can access information about the clock however in order to set the\
  \ time or modify other settings one has to be root.\n\nIn order to get info its possible to call functions from the `clock`\
  \ subsystem like: `clock_get_time`, `clock_get_attributtes` or `clock_alarm`\\\nIn order to modify values the `clock_priv`\
  \ subsystem can be sued with functions like `clock_set_time` and `clock_set_attributes`\n\n### Processors and Processor\
  \ Set\n\nThe processor apis allows to control a single logical processor calling functions like `processor_start`, `processor_exit`,\
  \ `processor_info`, `processor_get_assignment`...\n\nMoreover, the **processor set** apis provides a way to group multiple\
  \ processors into a group. It's possible to retrieve the default processor set calling **`processor_set_default`**.\\\n\
  These are some interesting APIs to interact with the processor set:\n\n- `processor_set_statistics`\n- `processor_set_tasks`:\
  \ Return an array of send rights to all tasks inside the processor set\n- `processor_set_threads`: Return an array of send\
  \ rights to all threads inside the processor set\n- `processor_set_stack_usage`\n- `processor_set_info`\n\nAs mentioned\
  \ in [**this post**](https://reverse.put.as/2014/05/05/about-the-processor_set_tasks-access-to-kernel-memory-vulnerability/),\
  \ in the past this allowed to bypass the previously mentioned protection to get task ports in other processes to control\
  \ them by calling **`processor_set_tasks`** and getting a host port on every process.\\\nNowadays you need root to use that\
  \ function and this is protected so you will only be able to get these ports on unprotected processes.\n\nYou can try it\

  \ used by macOS) inter-Process Communication, is a framework for **communication between processes** on macOS and iOS. XPC\
  \ provides a mechanism for making **safe, asynchronous method calls between different processes** on the system. It's a\
  \ part of Apple's security paradigm, allowing for the **creation of privilege-separated applications** where each **component**\
  \ runs with **only the permissions it needs** to do its job, thereby limiting the potential damage from a compromised process.\n\
  \nFor more information about how this **communication work** on how it **could be vulnerable** check:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nmacos-xpc/\n\
  {{#endref}}\n\n## MIG - Mach Interface Generator\n\nMIG was created to **simplify the process of Mach IPC** code creation.\
  \ This is because a lot of work to program RPC involves the same actions (packing arguments, sending the msg, unpacking\
  \ the data in the server...).\n\nMIC basically **generates the needed code** for server and client to communicate with a\
  \ given definition (in IDL -Interface Definition language-). Even if the generated code is ugly, a developer will just need\
  \ to import it and his code will be much simpler than before.\n\nFor more info check:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nmacos-mig-mach-interface-generator.md\n\
  {{#endref}}\n\n## MIG handler type confusion -> fake vtable pointer-chain hijack\n\nIf a MIG handler **retrieves a C++ object\
  \ by Mach message-supplied ID** (e.g., from an internal Object Map) and then **assumes a specific concrete type without\
  \ validating the real dynamic type**, later virtual calls can dispatch through attacker-controlled pointers. In `coreaudiod`’s\
  \ `com.apple.audio.audiohald` service (CVE-2024-54529), `_XIOContext_Fetch_Workgroup_Port` used the looked-up `HALS_Object`\
  \ as an `ioct` and executed a vtable call via:\n\n```asm\nmov rax, qword ptr [rdi]\ncall qword ptr [rax + 0x168]  ; indirect\
  \ call through vtable slot\n```\n\nBecause `rax` comes from **multiple dereferences**, exploitation needs a structured pointer\
  \ chain rather than a single overwrite. One working layout:\n\n1. In the **confused heap object** (treated as `ioct`), place\
  \ a **pointer at +0x68** to attacker-controlled memory.\n2. At that controlled memory, place a **pointer at +0x0** to a\
  \ **fake vtable**.\n3. In the fake vtable, write the **call target at +0x168**, so the handler jumps to attacker-chosen\
  \ code when dereferencing `[rax+0x168]`.\n\nConceptually:\n\n```\nHALS_Object + 0x68  -> controlled_object\n*(controlled_object\
  \ + 0x0) -> fake_vtable\n*(fake_vtable + 0x168)     -> RIP target\n```\n\n### LLDB triage to anchor the gadget\n\n1. **Break\
  \ on the faulting handler** (or `mach_msg`/`dispatch_mig_server`) and trigger the crash to confirm the dispatch chain (`HALB_MIGServer_server\
  \ -> dispatch_mig_server -> _XIOContext_Fetch_Workgroup_Port`).\n2. In the crash frame, disassemble to capture the **indirect\
  \ call slot offset** (`call qword ptr [rax + 0x168]`).\n3. Inspect registers/memory to verify where `rdi` (base object)\
  \ and `rax` (vtable pointer) originate and whether the offsets above are reachable with controlled data.\n4. Use the offset\
  \ map to heap-shape the **0x68 -> 0x0 -> 0x168** chain and convert the type confusion into a reliable control-flow hijack\
  \ inside the Mach service.\n\n## References\n\n- [https://docs.darlinghq.org/internals/macos-specifics/mach-ports.html](https://docs.darlinghq.org/internals/macos-specifics/mach-ports.html)\n\
