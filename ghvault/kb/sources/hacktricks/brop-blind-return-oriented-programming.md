  \nThe goal of this attack is to be able to **abuse a ROP via a buffer overflow without any information about the vulnerable\
  \ binary**.\\\nThis attack is based on the following scenario:\n\n- A stack vulnerability and knowledge of how to trigger\
  \ it.\n- A server application that restarts after a crash.\n\n## Attack\n\n### **1. Find vulnerable offset** sending one\
  \ more character until a malfunction of the server is detected\n\n### **2. Brute-force canary** to leak it\n\n### **3. Brute-force\
  \ stored RBP and RIP** addresses in the stack to leak them\n\nYou can find more information about these processes [here\
  \ (BF Forked & Threaded Stack Canaries)](../common-binary-protections-and-bypasses/stack-canaries/bf-forked-stack-canaries.md)\
  \ and [here (BF Addresses in the Stack)](../common-binary-protections-and-bypasses/pie/bypassing-canary-and-pie.md).\n\n\
  ### **4. Find the stop gadget**\n\nThis gadget basically allows to confirm that something interesting was executed by the\
  \ ROP gadget because the execution didn't crash. Usually, this gadget is going to be something that **stops the execution**\
  \ and it's positioned at the end of the ROP chain when looking for ROP gadgets to confirm a specific ROP gadget was executed\n\
  \n### **5. Find BROP gadget**\n\nThis technique uses the [**ret2csu**](ret2csu.md) gadget. And this is because if you access\
  \ this gadget in the middle of some instructions you get gadgets to control **`rsi`** and **`rdi`**:\n\n<figure><img src=\"\
  ../../images/image (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png\" alt=\"\" width=\"278\"><figcaption><p><a href=\"\
  https://www.scs.stanford.edu/brop/bittau-brop.pdf\">https://www.scs.stanford.edu/brop/bittau-brop.pdf</a></p></figcaption></figure>\n\
  \nThese would be the gadgets:\n\n- `pop rsi; pop r15; ret`\n- `pop rdi; ret`\n\nNotice how with those gadgets it's possible\
  \ to **control 2 arguments** of a function to call.\n\nAlso, notice that the ret2csu gadget has a **very unique signature**\
  \ because it's going to be poping 6 registers from the stack. SO sending a chain like:\n\n`'A' * offset + canary + rbp +\
  \ ADDR + 0xdead * 6 + STOP`\n\nIf the **STOP is executed**, this basically means an **address that is popping 6 registers**\
  \ from the stack was used. Or that the address used was also a STOP address.\n\nIn order to **remove this last option**\
  \ a new chain like the following is executed and it must not execute the STOP gadget to confirm the previous one did pop\
  \ 6 registers:\n\n`'A' * offset + canary + rbp + ADDR`\n\nKnowing the address of the ret2csu gadget, it's possible to **infer\
  \ the address of the gadgets to control `rsi` and `rdi`**.\n\n### 6. Find PLT\n\nThe PLT table can be searched from 0x400000\
  \ or from the **leaked RIP address** from the stack (if **PIE** is being used). The **entries** of the table are **separated\
  \ by 16B** (0x10B), and when one function is called the server doesn't crash even if the arguments aren't correct. Also,\
  \ checking the address of a entry in the **PLT + 6B also doesn't crash** as it's the first code executed.\n\nTherefore,\
  \ it's possible to find the PLT table checking the following behaviours:\n\n- `'A' * offset + canary + rbp + ADDR + STOP`\
  \ -> no crash\n- `'A' * offset + canary + rbp + (ADDR + 0x6) + STOP` -> no crash\n- `'A' * offset + canary + rbp + (ADDR\
  \ + 0x10) + STOP` -> no crash\n\n### 7. Finding strcmp\n\nThe **`strcmp`** function sets the register **`rdx`** to the length\
  \ of the string being compared. Note that **`rdx`** is the **third argument** and we need it to be **bigger than 0** in\
  \ order to later use `write` to leak the program.\n\nIt's possible to find the location of **`strcmp`** in the PLT based\
  \ on its behaviour using the fact that we can now control the 2 first arguments of functions:\n\n- strcmp(\\<non read addr>,\
  \ \\<non read addr>) -> crash\n- strcmp(\\<non read addr>, \\<read addr>) -> crash\n- strcmp(\\<read addr>, \\<non read\
  \ addr>) -> crash\n- strcmp(\\<read addr>, \\<read addr>) -> no crash\n\nIt's possible to check for this by calling each\
  \ entry of the PLT table or by using the **PLT slow path** which basically consist on **calling an entry in the PLT table\
  \ + 0xb** (which calls to **`dlresolve`**) followed in the stack by the **entry number one wishes to probe** (starting at\
  \ zero) to scan all PLT entries from the first one:\n\n- strcmp(\\<non read addr>, \\<read addr>) -> crash\n  - `b'A' *\
  \ offset + canary + rbp + (BROP + 0x9) + RIP + (BROP + 0x7) + p64(0x300) + p64(0x0) + (PLT + 0xb ) + p64(ENTRY) + STOP`\
  \ -> Will crash\n- strcmp(\\<read addr>, \\<non read addr>) -> crash\n  - `b'A' * offset + canary + rbp + (BROP + 0x9) +\
  \ p64(0x300) + (BROP + 0x7) + RIP + p64(0x0) + (PLT + 0xb ) + p64(ENTRY) + STOP`\n- strcmp(\\<read addr>, \\<read addr>)\
  \ -> no crash\n  - `b'A' * offset + canary + rbp + (BROP + 0x9) + RIP + (BROP + 0x7) + RIP + p64(0x0) + (PLT + 0xb ) + p64(ENTRY)\
  \ + STOP`\n\nRemember that:\n\n- BROP + 0x7 point to **`pop RSI; pop R15; ret;`**\n- BROP + 0x9 point to **`pop RDI; ret;`**\n\
  - PLT + 0xb point to a call to **dl_resolve**.\n\nHaving found `strcmp` it's possible to set **`rdx`** to a value bigger\
  \ than 0.\n\n> [!TIP]\n> Note that usually `rdx` will host already a value bigger than 0, so this step might not be necesary.\n\
  \n### 8. Finding Write or equivalent\n\nFinally, it's needed a gadget that exfiltrates data in order to exfiltrate the binary.\
  \ And at this moment it's possible to **control 2 arguments and set `rdx` bigger than 0.**\n\nThere are 3 common funtions\
  \ taht could be abused for this:\n\n- `puts(data)`\n- `dprintf(fd, data)`\n- `write(fd, data, len(data)`\n\nHowever, the\
  \ original paper only mentions the **`write`** one, so lets talk about it:\n\nThe current problem is that we don't know\
  \ **where the write function is inside the PLT** and we don't know **a fd number to send the data to our socket**.\n\nHowever,\
  \ we know **where the PLT table is** and it's possible to find write based on its **behaviour**. And we can create **several\
  \ connections** with the server an d use a **high FD** hoping that it matches some of our connections.\n\nBehaviour signatures\
  \ to find those functions:\n\n- `'A' * offset + canary + rbp + (BROP + 0x9) + RIP + (BROP + 0x7) + p64(0) + p64(0) + (PLT\
  \ + 0xb) + p64(ENTRY) + STOP` -> If there is data printed, then puts was found\n- `'A' * offset + canary + rbp + (BROP +\
  \ 0x9) + FD + (BROP + 0x7) + RIP + p64(0x0) + (PLT + 0xb) + p64(ENTRY) + STOP` -> If there is data printed, then dprintf\
  \ was found\n- `'A' * offset + canary + rbp + (BROP + 0x9) + RIP + (BROP + 0x7) + (RIP + 0x1) + p64(0x0) + (PLT + 0xb )\
  \ + p64(STRCMP ENTRY) + (BROP + 0x9) + FD + (BROP + 0x7) + RIP + p64(0x0) + (PLT + 0xb) + p64(ENTRY) + STOP` -> If there\
  \ is data printed, then write was found\n\n## Automatic Exploitation\n\n- [https://github.com/Hakumarachi/Bropper](https://github.com/Hakumarachi/Bropper)\n\
