_body: "# Uninitialized Variables\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n## Basic Information\n\nThe core\
  \ idea here is to understand what happens with **uninitialized variables as they will have the value that was already in\
  \ the assigned memory to them.** Example:\n\n- **Function 1: `initializeVariable`**: We declare a variable `x` and assign\
  \ it a value, let's say `0x1234`. This action is akin to reserving a spot in memory and putting a specific value in it.\n\
  - **Function 2: `useUninitializedVariable`**: Here, we declare another variable `y` but do not assign any value to it. In\
  \ C, uninitialized variables don't automatically get set to zero. Instead, they retain whatever value was last stored at\
  \ their memory location.\n\nWhen we run these two functions **sequentially**:\n\n1. In `initializeVariable`, `x` is assigned\
  \ a value (`0x1234`), which occupies a specific memory address.\n2. In `useUninitializedVariable`, `y` is declared but not\
  \ assigned a value, so it takes the memory spot right after `x`. Due to not initializing `y`, it ends up \"inheriting\"\
  \ the value from the same memory location used by `x`, because that's the last value that was there.\n\nThis behavior illustrates\
  \ a key concept in low-level programming: **Memory management is crucial**, and uninitialized variables can lead to unpredictable\
  \ behavior or security vulnerabilities, as they may unintentionally hold sensitive data left in memory.\n\nUninitialized\
  \ stack variables could pose several security risks like:\n\n- **Data Leakage**: Sensitive information such as passwords,\
  \ encryption keys, or personal details can be exposed if stored in uninitialized variables, allowing attackers to potentially\
  \ read this data.\n- **Information Disclosure**: The contents of uninitialized variables might reveal details about the\
  \ program's memory layout or internal operations, aiding attackers in developing targeted exploits.\n- **Crashes and Instability**:\
  \ Operations involving uninitialized variables can result in undefined behavior, leading to program crashes or unpredictable\
  \ outcomes.\n- **Arbitrary Code Execution**: In certain scenarios, attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities to alter\
  \ the program's execution flow, enabling them to execute arbitrary code, which might include remote code execution threats.\n\
  \n### Example\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n// Function to initialize and print a variable\nvoid initializeAndPrint() {\n\
  \    int initializedVar = 100; // Initialize the variable\n    printf(\"Initialized Variable:\\n\");\n    printf(\"Address:\
  \ %p, Value: %d\\n\\n\", (void*)&initializedVar, initializedVar);\n}\n\n// Function to demonstrate the behavior of an uninitialized\
  \ variable\nvoid demonstrateUninitializedVar() {\n    int uninitializedVar; // Declare but do not initialize\n    printf(\"\
  Uninitialized Variable:\\n\");\n    printf(\"Address: %p, Value: %d\\n\\n\", (void*)&uninitializedVar, uninitializedVar);\n\
  }\n\nint main() {\n    printf(\"Demonstrating Initialized vs. Uninitialized Variables in C\\n\\n\");\n\n    // First, call\
  \ the function that initializes its variable\n    initializeAndPrint();\n\n    // Then, call the function that has an uninitialized\
  \ variable\n    demonstrateUninitializedVar();\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n#### How This Works:\n\n- **`initializeAndPrint`\
  \ Function**: This function declares an integer variable `initializedVar`, assigns it the value `100`, and then prints both\
  \ the memory address and the value of the variable. This step is straightforward and shows how an initialized variable behaves.\n\
  - **`demonstrateUninitializedVar` Function**: In this function, we declare an integer variable `uninitializedVar` without\
  \ initializing it. When we attempt to print its value, the output might show a random number. This number represents whatever\
  \ data was previously at that memory location. Depending on the environment and compiler, the actual output can vary, and\
  \ sometimes, for safety, some compilers might automatically initialize variables to zero, though this should not be relied\
  \ upon.\n- **`main` Function**: The `main` function calls both of the above functions in sequence, demonstrating the contrast\
  \ between an initialized variable and an uninitialized one.\n\n## Practical exploitation patterns (2024–2025)\n\nThe classic\
  \ \"read-before-write\" bug remains relevant because modern mitigations (ASLR, canaries) often rely on secrecy. Typical\
  \ attack surfaces:\n\n- **Partially initialized structs copied to userland**: Kernel or drivers frequently `memset` only\
  \ a length field and then `copy_to_user(&u, &local_struct, sizeof(local_struct))`. Padding and unused fields leak stack\
  \ canary halves, saved frame pointers or kernel pointers. If the struct contains a function pointer, leaving it uninitialized\
  \ may also allow **controlled overwrite** when later reused.\n- **Uninitialized stack buffers reused as indexes/lengths**:\
  \ An uninitialized `size_t len;` used to bound `read(fd, buf, len)` may give attackers out-of-bounds reads/writes or allow\
  \ bypassing size checks when the stack slot still contains a large value from a prior call.\n- **Compiler-added padding**:\
  \ Even when individual members are initialized, implicit padding bytes between them are not. Copying the whole struct to\
  \ userland leaks padding that often contains prior stack content (canaries, pointers).\n- **ROP/Canary disclosure**: If\
  \ a function copies a local struct to stdout for debugging, uninitialized padding can reveal the stack canary enabling subsequent\
  \ stack overflow exploitation without brute-force.\n\nMinimal PoC pattern to detect such issues during review:\n\n```c\n\
  struct msg {\n    char data[0x20];\n    uint32_t len;\n};\n\nssize_t handler(int fd) {\n    struct msg m;              //\
  \ never fully initialized\n    m.len = read(fd, m.data, sizeof(m.data));\n    // later debug helper\n    write(1, &m, sizeof(m));\
  \   // leaks padding + stale stack\n    return m.len;\n}\n```\n\n## Mitigations & compiler options (keep in mind when bypassing)\n\
  \n- **Clang/GCC auto-init**: Recent toolchains expose `-ftrivial-auto-var-init=zero` or `-ftrivial-auto-var-init=pattern`,\
  \ filling *every* automatic (stack) variable at function entry with zeros or a poison pattern (0xAA / 0xFE). This closes\
  \ most uninitialized-stack info leaks and makes exploitation harder by converting secrets into known values.\n- **Linux\
  \ kernel hardening**: Kernels built with `CONFIG_INIT_STACK_ALL` or the newer `CONFIG_INIT_STACK_ALL_PATTERN` zero/pattern-initialize\
  \ every stack slot at function entry, wiping canaries/pointers that would otherwise leak. Look for distros shipping Clang-built\
  \ kernels with these options enabled (common in 6.8+ hardening configs).\n- **Opt-out attributes**: Clang now allows `__attribute__((uninitialized))`\
  \ on specific locals/structs to keep performance-critical areas uninitialized even when global auto-init is enabled. Review\
  \ such annotations carefully—they often mark deliberate attack surface for side channels.\n\nFrom an attacker perspective,\
  \ knowing whether the binary was built with these flags determines if stack-leak primitives are viable or if you must pivot\
  \ to heap/data-section disclosures.\n\n## Finding uninitialized-stack bugs quickly\n\n- **Compiler diagnostics**: Build\
  \ with `-Wall -Wextra -Wuninitialized` (GCC/Clang). For C++ code, `clang-tidy -checks=cppcoreguidelines-init-variables`\
  \ will auto-fix many cases to zero-init and is handy to spot missed locals during audit.\n- **Dynamic tools**: `-fsanitize=memory`\
  \ (MSan) in Clang or Valgrind's `--track-origins=yes` reliably flag reads of uninitialized stack bytes during fuzzing. Instrument\
  \ test harnesses with these to surface subtle padding leaks.\n- **Grepping patterns**: In reviews, search for `copy_to_user`\
  \ / `write` calls of whole structs, or `memcpy`/`send` of stack data where only part of the struct is set. Pay special attention\
  \ to error paths where initialization is skipped.\n\n## ARM64 Example\n\nThis doesn't change at all in ARM64 as local variables\
  \ are also managed in the stack, you can [**check this example**](https://8ksec.io/arm64-reversing-and-exploitation-part-6-exploiting-an-uninitialized-stack-variable-vulnerability/)\
  \ were this is shown.\n\n\n\n## References\n\n- [CONFIG_INIT_STACK_ALL_PATTERN documentation](https://www.kernelconfig.io/config_init_stack_all_pattern)\n\
