  \n## Overview\n\nA cold-wallet theft chain combined a **supply-chain compromise of the Safe{Wallet} web UI** with an **on-chain\
  \ delegatecall primitive that overwrote a proxy’s implementation pointer (slot 0)**. The key takeaways are:\n\n- If a dApp\
  \ can inject code into the signing path, it can make a signer produce a valid **EIP-712 signature over attacker-chosen fields**\
  \ while restoring the original UI data so other signers remain unaware.\n- Safe proxies store `masterCopy` (implementation)\
  \ at **storage slot 0**. A delegatecall to a contract that writes to slot 0 effectively “upgrades” the Safe to attacker\
  \ logic, yielding full control of the wallet.\n\n## Off-chain: Targeted signing mutation in Safe{Wallet}\n\nA tampered Safe\
  \ bundle (`_app-*.js`) selectively attacked specific Safe + signer addresses. The injected logic executed right before the\
  \ signing call:\n\n```javascript\n// Pseudocode of the malicious flow\norig = structuredClone(tx.data);\nif (isVictimSafe\
  \ && isVictimSigner && tx.data.operation === 0) {\n  tx.data.to = attackerContract;\n  tx.data.data = \"0xa9059cbb...\"\
  ;      // ERC-20 transfer selector\n  tx.data.operation = 1;                 // delegatecall\n  tx.data.value = 0;\n  tx.data.safeTxGas\
  \ = 45746;\n  const sig = await sdk.signTransaction(tx, safeVersion);\n  sig.data = orig;                       // restore\
  \ original before submission\n  tx.data = orig;\n  return sig;\n}\n```\n\n### Attack properties\n- **Context-gated**: hard-coded\
  \ allowlists for victim Safes/signers prevented noise and lowered detection.\n- **Last-moment mutation**: fields (`to`,\
  \ `data`, `operation`, gas) were overwritten immediately before `signTransaction`, then reverted, so proposal payloads in\
  \ the UI looked benign while signatures matched the attacker payload.\n- **EIP-712 opacity**: wallets showed structured\
  \ data but did not decode nested calldata or highlight `operation = delegatecall`, making the mutated message effectively\
  \ blind-signed.\n\n### Gateway validation relevance\nSafe proposals are submitted to the **Safe Client Gateway**. Prior\
  \ to hardened checks, the gateway could accept a proposal where `safeTxHash`/signature corresponded to different fields\
  \ than the JSON body if the UI rewrote them post-signing. After the incident, the gateway now rejects proposals whose hash/signature\
  \ do not match the submitted transaction. Similar server-side hash verification should be enforced on any signing-orchestration\
  \ API.\n\n### 2025 Bybit/Safe incident highlights\n- The February 21, 2025 Bybit cold-wallet drain (~401k ETH) reused the\
  \ same pattern: a compromised Safe S3 bundle only triggered for Bybit signers and swapped `operation=0` → `1`, pointing\
  \ `to` at a pre-deployed attacker contract that writes slot 0.\n- Wayback-cached `_app-52c9031bfa03da47.js` shows the logic\
  \ keyed on Bybit’s Safe (`0x1db9…cf4`) and signer addresses, then immediately rolled back to a clean bundle two minutes\
  \ after execution, mirroring the “mutate → sign → restore” trick.\n- The malicious contract (e.g., `0x9622…c7242`) contained\
  \ simple functions `sweepETH/sweepERC20` plus a `transfer(address,uint256)` that writes the implementation slot. Execution\
  \ of `execTransaction(..., operation=1, to=contract, data=transfer(newImpl,0))` shifted the proxy implementation and granted\
  \ full control.\n\n## On-chain: Delegatecall proxy takeover via slot collision\n\nSafe proxies keep `masterCopy` at **storage\
  \ slot 0** and delegate all logic to it. Because Safe supports **`operation = 1` (delegatecall)**, any signed transaction\
  \ can point to an arbitrary contract and execute its code in the proxy’s storage context.\n\nAn attacker contract mimicked\
  \ an ERC-20 `transfer(address,uint256)` but instead wrote `_to` into slot 0:\n\n```solidity\n// Decompiler view (storage\
  \ slot 0 write)\nuint256 stor0; // slot 0\nfunction transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) external {\n    stor0 = uint256(uint160(_to));\n\
  }\n```\n\nExecution path:\n1. Victims sign `execTransaction` with `operation = delegatecall`, `to = attackerContract`, `data\
  \ = transfer(newImpl, 0)`.\n2. Safe masterCopy validates signatures over these parameters.\n3. Proxy delegatecalls into\
  \ `attackerContract`; the `transfer` body writes slot 0.\n4. Slot 0 (`masterCopy`) now points to attacker-controlled logic\
  \ → **full wallet takeover and fund drain**.\n\n### Guard & version notes (post-incident hardening)\n- Safes >= v1.3.0 can\
  \ install a **Guard** to veto `delegatecall` or enforce ACLs on `to`/selectors; Bybit ran v1.1.1, so no Guard hook existed.\
  \ Upgrading contracts (and re-adding owners) is required to gain this control plane.\n\n## Detection & hardening checklist\n\
  \n- **UI integrity**: pin JS assets / SRI; monitor bundle diffs; treat signing UI as part of the trust boundary.\n- **Sign-time\
  \ validation**: hardware wallets with **EIP-712 clear-signing**; explicitly render `operation` and decode nested calldata.\
  \ Reject signing when `operation = 1` unless policy allows it.\n- **Server-side hash checks**: gateways/services that relay\
  \ proposals must recompute `safeTxHash` and validate signatures match the submitted fields.\n- **Policy/allowlists**: preflight\
  \ rules for `to`, selectors, asset types, and disallow delegatecall except for vetted flows. Require an internal policy\
  \ service before broadcasting fully signed transactions.\n- **Contract design**: avoid exposing arbitrary delegatecall in\
  \ multisig/treasury wallets unless strictly necessary. Place upgrade pointers away from slot 0 or guard with explicit upgrade\
  \ logic and access control.\n- **Monitoring**: alert on delegatecall executions from wallets holding treasury funds, and\
  \ on proposals that change `operation` from typical `call` patterns.\n\n## References\n\n- [AnChain.AI forensic breakdown\
