  \ checkJSSConnection`\n- Kandji\n\nIf you manage to **compromise admin credentials** to access the management platform,\
  \ you can **potentially compromise all the computers** by distributing your malware in the machines.\n\nFor red teaming\
  \ in MacOS environments it's highly recommended to have some understanding of how the MDMs work:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nmacos-mdm/\n\
  {{#endref}}\n\n### Using MDM as a C2\n\nA MDM will have permission to install, query or remove profiles, install applications,\
  \ create local admin accounts, set firmware password, change the FileVault key...\n\nIn order to run your own MDM you need\
  \ to **your CSR signed by a vendor** which you could try to get with [**https://mdmcert.download/**](https://mdmcert.download/).\
  \ And to run your own MDM for Apple devices you could use [**MicroMDM**](https://github.com/micromdm/micromdm).\n\nHowever,\
  \ to install an application in an enrolled device, you still need it to be signed by a developer account... however, upon\
  \ MDM enrolment the **device adds the SSL cert of the MDM as a trusted CA**, so you can now sign anything.\n\nTo enrol the\
  \ device in a MDM you. need to install a **`mobileconfig`** file as root, which could be delivered via a **pkg** file (you\
  \ could compress it in zip and when downloaded from safari it will be decompressed).\n\n**Mythic agent Orthrus** uses this\
  \ technique.\n\n### Abusing JAMF PRO\n\nJAMF can run **custom scripts** (scripts developed by the sysadmin), **native payloads**\
  \ (local account creation, set EFI password, file/process monitoring...) and **MDM** (device configurations, device certificates...).\n\
  \n#### JAMF self-enrolment\n\nGo to a page such as `https://<company-name>.jamfcloud.com/enroll/` to see if they have **self-enrolment\
  \ enabled**. If they have it might **ask for credentials to access**.\n\nYou could use the script [**JamfSniper.py**](https://github.com/WithSecureLabs/Jamf-Attack-Toolkit/blob/master/JamfSniper.py)\
  \ to perform a password spraying attack.\n\nMoreover, after finding proper credentials you could be able to brute-force\
  \ other usernames with the next form:\n\n![](<../../images/image (107).png>)\n\n#### JAMF device Authentication\n\n<figure><img\
  \ src=\"../../images/image (167).png\" alt=\"\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\nThe **`jamf`** binary contained the\
  \ secret to open the keychain which at the time of the discovery was **shared** among everybody and it was: **`jk23ucnq91jfu9aj`**.\\\
  \nMoreover, jamf **persist** as a **LaunchDaemon** in **`/Library/LaunchAgents/com.jamf.management.agent.plist`**\n\n####\
  \ JAMF Device Takeover\n\nThe **JSS** (Jamf Software Server) **URL** that **`jamf`** will use is located in **`/Library/Preferences/com.jamfsoftware.jamf.plist`**.\\\
  \nThis file basically contains the URL:\n\n```bash\nplutil -convert xml1 -o - /Library/Preferences/com.jamfsoftware.jamf.plist\n\
  \n[...]\n\t<key>is_virtual_machine</key>\n\t<false/>\n\t<key>jss_url</key>\n\t<string>https://subdomain-company.jamfcloud.com/</string>\n\
  \t<key>last_management_framework_change_id</key>\n\t<integer>4</integer>\n[...]\n```\n\nSo, an attacker could drop a malicious\
  \ package (`pkg`) that **overwrites this file** when installed setting the **URL to a Mythic C2 listener from a Typhon agent**\
  \ to now be able to abuse JAMF as C2.\n\n```bash\n# After changing the URL you could wait for it to be reloaded or execute:\n\
  sudo jamf policy -id 0\n\n# TODO: There is an ID, maybe it's possible to have the real jamf connection and another one to\
  \ the C2\n```\n\n#### JAMF Impersonation\n\nIn order to **impersonate the communication** between a device and JMF you need:\n\
  \n- The **UUID** of the device: `ioreg -d2 -c IOPlatformExpertDevice | awk -F\" '/IOPlatformUUID/{print $(NF-1)}'`\n- The\
  \ **JAMF keychain** from: `/Library/Application\\ Support/Jamf/JAMF.keychain` which contains the device certificate\n\n\
  With this information, **create a VM** with the **stolen** Hardware **UUID** and with **SIP disabled**, drop the **JAMF\
  \ keychain,** **hook** the Jamf **agent** and steal its information.\n\n#### Secrets stealing\n\n<figure><img src=\"../../images/image\
  \ (1025).png\" alt=\"\"><figcaption><p>a</p></figcaption></figure>\n\nYou could also monitor the location `/Library/Application\
  \ Support/Jamf/tmp/` for the **custom scripts** admins might want to execute via Jamf as they are **placed here, executed\
  \ and removed**. These scripts **might contain credentials**.\n\nHowever, **credentials** might be passed tho these scripts\
  \ as **parameters**, so you would need to monitor `ps aux | grep -i jamf` (without even being root).\n\nThe script [**JamfExplorer.py**](https://github.com/WithSecureLabs/Jamf-Attack-Toolkit/blob/master/JamfExplorer.py)\
  \ can listen for new files being added and new process arguments.\n\n### macOS Remote Access\n\nAnd also about **MacOS**\
  \ \"special\" **network** **protocols**:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\n../macos-security-and-privilege-escalation/macos-protocols.md\n\
  {{#endref}}\n\n## Active Directory\n\nIn some occasions you will find that the **MacOS computer is connected to an AD**.\
  \ In this scenario you should try to **enumerate** the active directory as you are use to it. Find some **help** in the\
  \ following pages:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\n../../network-services-pentesting/pentesting-ldap.md\n{{#endref}}\n\n\n{{#ref}}\n../../windows-hardening/active-directory-methodology/\n\
  {{#endref}}\n\n\n{{#ref}}\n../../network-services-pentesting/pentesting-kerberos-88/\n{{#endref}}\n\nSome **local MacOS\
  \ tool** that may also help you is `dscl`:\n\n```bash\ndscl \"/Active Directory/[Domain]/All Domains\" ls /\n```\n\nAlso\
  \ there are some tools prepared for MacOS to automatically enumerate the AD and play with kerberos:\n\n- [**Machound**](https://github.com/XMCyber/MacHound):\
  \ MacHound is an extension to the Bloodhound audting tool allowing collecting and ingesting of Active Directory relationships\
  \ on MacOS hosts.\n- [**Bifrost**](https://github.com/its-a-feature/bifrost): Bifrost is an Objective-C project designed\
  \ to interact with the Heimdal krb5 APIs on macOS. The goal of the project is to enable better security testing around Kerberos\
  \ on macOS devices using native APIs without requiring any other framework or packages on the target.\n- [**Orchard**](https://github.com/its-a-feature/Orchard):\
  \ JavaScript for Automation (JXA) tool to do Active Directory enumeration.\n\n### Domain Information\n\n```bash\necho show\
  \ com.apple.opendirectoryd.ActiveDirectory | scutil\n```\n\n### Users\n\nThe three types of MacOS users are:\n\n- **Local\
  \ Users** — Managed by the local OpenDirectory service, they aren’t connected in any way to the Active Directory.\n- **Network\
  \ Users** — Volatile Active Directory users who require a connection to the DC server to authenticate.\n- **Mobile Users**\
  \ — Active Directory users with a local backup for their credentials and files.\n\nThe local information about users and\
  \ groups is stored in in the folder _/var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default._\\\nFor example, the info about user called _mark_ is\
  \ stored in _/var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default/users/mark.plist_ and the info about the group _admin_ is in _/var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default/groups/admin.plist_.\n\
  \nIn addition to using the HasSession and AdminTo edges, **MacHound adds three new edges** to the Bloodhound database:\n\
  \n- **CanSSH** - entity allowed to SSH to host\n- **CanVNC** - entity allowed to VNC to host\n- **CanAE** - entity allowed\
  \ to execute AppleEvent scripts on host\n\n```bash\n#User enumeration\ndscl . ls /Users\ndscl . read /Users/[username]\n\
  dscl \"/Active Directory/TEST/All Domains\" ls /Users\ndscl \"/Active Directory/TEST/All Domains\" read /Users/[username]\n\
  dscacheutil -q user\n\n#Computer enumeration\ndscl \"/Active Directory/TEST/All Domains\" ls /Computers\ndscl \"/Active\
  \ Directory/TEST/All Domains\" read \"/Computers/[compname]$\"\n\n#Group enumeration\ndscl . ls /Groups\ndscl . read \"\
  /Groups/[groupname]\"\ndscl \"/Active Directory/TEST/All Domains\" ls /Groups\ndscl \"/Active Directory/TEST/All Domains\"\
  \ read \"/Groups/[groupname]\"\n\n#Domain Information\ndsconfigad -show\n```\n\nMore info in [https://its-a-feature.github.io/posts/2018/01/Active-Directory-Discovery-with-a-Mac/](https://its-a-feature.github.io/posts/2018/01/Active-Directory-Discovery-with-a-Mac/)\n\
  \n### Computer$ password\n\nGet passwords using:\n\n```bash\nbifrost --action askhash --username [name] --password [password]\
  \ --domain [domain]\n```\n\nIt's possible to access the **`Computer$`** password inside the System keychain.\n\n### Over-Pass-The-Hash\n\
  \nGet a TGT for an specific user and service:\n\n```bash\nbifrost --action asktgt --username [user] --domain [domain.com]\
  \ \\\n       --hash [hash] --enctype [enctype] --keytab [/path/to/keytab]\n```\n\nOnce the TGT is gathered, it's possible\
  \ to inject it in the current session with:\n\n```bash\nbifrost --action asktgt --username test_lab_admin \\\n       --hash\
  \ CF59D3256B62EE655F6430B0F80701EE05A0885B8B52E9C2480154AFA62E78 \\\n       --enctype aes256 --domain test.lab.local\n```\n\
  \n### Kerberoasting\n\n```bash\nbifrost --action asktgs --spn [service] --domain [domain.com] \\\n       --username [user]\
  \ --hash [hash] --enctype [enctype]\n```\n\nWith obtained service tickets it's possible to try to access shares in other\
  \ computers:\n\n```bash\nsmbutil view //computer.fqdn\nmount -t smbfs //server/folder /local/mount/point\n```\n\n## Accessing\
  \ the Keychain\n\nThe Keychain highly probably contains sensitive information that if accessed without generating a prompt\
  \ could help to move forward a red team exercise:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nmacos-keychain.md\n{{#endref}}\n\n## External Services\n\
  \nMacOS Red Teaming is different from a regular Windows Red Teaming as usually **MacOS is integrated with several external\
  \ platforms directly**. A common configuration of MacOS is to access to the computer using **OneLogin synchronised credentials,\
  \ and accessing several external services** (like github, aws...) via OneLogin.\n\n## Misc Red Team techniques\n\n### Safari\n\
  \nWhen a file is downloaded in Safari, if its a \"safe\" file, it will be **automatically opened**. So for example, if you\
  \ **download a zip**, it will be automatically decompressed:\n\n<figure><img src=\"../../images/image (226).png\" alt=\"\
