  \ tools\n\nSoftware:\n\n- ReverseKit: [https://github.com/zer0condition/ReverseKit](https://github.com/zer0condition/ReverseKit)\n\
  \n## Wasm decompiler / Wat compiler\n\nOnline:\n\n- Use [https://webassembly.github.io/wabt/demo/wasm2wat/index.html](https://webassembly.github.io/wabt/demo/wasm2wat/index.html)\
  \ to **decompile** from wasm (binary) to wat (clear text)\n- Use [https://webassembly.github.io/wabt/demo/wat2wasm/](https://webassembly.github.io/wabt/demo/wat2wasm/)\
  \ to **compile** from wat to wasm\n- you can also try to use [https://wwwg.github.io/web-wasmdec/](https://wwwg.github.io/web-wasmdec/)\
  \ to decompile\n\nSoftware:\n\n- [https://www.pnfsoftware.com/jeb/demo](https://www.pnfsoftware.com/jeb/demo)\n- [https://github.com/wwwg/wasmdec](https://github.com/wwwg/wasmdec)\n\
  \n## .NET decompiler\n\n### [dotPeek](https://www.jetbrains.com/decompiler/)\n\ndotPeek is a decompiler that **decompiles\
  \ and examines multiple formats**, including **libraries** (.dll), **Windows metadata file**s (.winmd), and **executables**\
  \ (.exe). Once decompiled, an assembly can be saved as a Visual Studio project (.csproj).\n\nThe merit here is that if a\
  \ lost source code requires restoration from a legacy assembly, this action can save time. Further, dotPeek provides handy\
  \ navigation throughout the decompiled code, making it one of the perfect tools for **Xamarin algorithm analysis.**\n\n\
  ### [.NET Reflector](https://www.red-gate.com/products/reflector/)\n\nWith a comprehensive add-in model and an API that\
  \ extends the tool to suit your exact needs, .NET reflector saves time and simplifies development. Let's take a look at\
  \ the plethora of reverse engineering services this tool provides:\n\n- Provides an insight into how the data flows through\
  \ a library or component\n- Provides insight into the implementation and usage of .NET languages and frameworks\n- Finds\
  \ undocumented and unexposed functionality to get more out of the APIs and technologies used.\n- Finds dependencies and\
  \ different assemblies\n- Tracks down the exact location of errors in your code, third-party components, and libraries.\n\
  - Debugs into the source of all the .NET code you work with.\n\n### [ILSpy](https://github.com/icsharpcode/ILSpy) & [dnSpy](https://github.com/dnSpy/dnSpy/releases)\n\
  \n[ILSpy plugin for Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/icsharpcode/ilspy-vscode): You can have it in any OS (you can\
  \ install it directly from VSCode, no need to download the git. Click on **Extensions** and **search ILSpy**).\\\nIf you\
  \ need to **decompile**, **modify** and **recompile** again you can use [**dnSpy**](https://github.com/dnSpy/dnSpy/releases)\
  \ or an actively maintained fork of it, [**dnSpyEx**](https://github.com/dnSpyEx/dnSpy/releases). (**Right Click -> Modify\
  \ Method** to change something inside a function).\n\n### DNSpy Logging\n\nIn order to make **DNSpy log some information\
  \ in a file**, you could use this snippet:\n\n```cs\nusing System.IO;\npath = \"C:\\\\inetpub\\\\temp\\\\MyTest2.txt\";\n\
  File.AppendAllText(path, \"Password: \" + password + \"\\n\");\n```\n\n### DNSpy Debugging\n\nIn order to debug code using\
  \ DNSpy you need to:\n\nFirst, change the **Assembly attributes** related to **debugging**:\n\n![](<../../images/image (973).png>)\n\
  \nFrom:\n\n```aspnet\n[assembly: Debuggable(DebuggableAttribute.DebuggingModes.IgnoreSymbolStoreSequencePoints)]\n```\n\n\
  To:\n\n```\n[assembly: Debuggable(DebuggableAttribute.DebuggingModes.Default |\nDebuggableAttribute.DebuggingModes.DisableOptimizations\
  \ |\nDebuggableAttribute.DebuggingModes.IgnoreSymbolStoreSequencePoints |\nDebuggableAttribute.DebuggingModes.EnableEditAndContinue)]\n\
  ```\n\nAnd click on **compile**:\n\n![](<../../images/image (314) (1).png>)\n\nThen save the new file via _**File >> Save\
  \ module...**_:\n\n![](<../../images/image (602).png>)\n\nThis is necessary because if you don't do this, at **runtime**\
  \ several **optimisations** will be applied to the code and it could be possible that while debugging a **break-point is\
  \ never hit** or some **variables don't exist**.\n\nThen, if your .NET application is being **run** by **IIS** you can **restart**\
  \ it with:\n\n```\niisreset /noforce\n```\n\nThen, in order to start debugging you should close all the opened files and\
  \ inside the **Debug Tab** select **Attach to Process...**:\n\n![](<../../images/image (318).png>)\n\nThen select **w3wp.exe**\
  \ to attach to the **IIS server** and click **attach**:\n\n![](<../../images/image (113).png>)\n\nNow that we are debugging\
  \ the process, it's time to stop it and load all the modules. First click on _Debug >> Break All_ and then click on _**Debug\
  \ >> Windows >> Modules**_:\n\n![](<../../images/image (132).png>)\n\n![](<../../images/image (834).png>)\n\nClick any module\
  \ on **Modules** and select **Open All Modules**:\n\n![](<../../images/image (922).png>)\n\nRight click any module in **Assembly\
  \ Explorer** and click **Sort Assemblies**:\n\n![](<../../images/image (339).png>)\n\n## Java decompiler\n\n[https://github.com/skylot/jadx](https://github.com/skylot/jadx)\\\
  \n[https://github.com/java-decompiler/jd-gui/releases](https://github.com/java-decompiler/jd-gui/releases)\n\n## Debugging\
  \ DLLs\n\n### Using IDA\n\n- **Load rundll32** (64bits in C:\\Windows\\System32\\rundll32.exe and 32 bits in C:\\Windows\\\
  SysWOW64\\rundll32.exe)\n- Select **Windbg** debugger\n- Select \"**Suspend on library load/unload**\"\n\n![](<../../images/image\
  \ (868).png>)\n\n- Configure the **parameters** of the execution putting the **path to the DLL** and the function that you\
  \ want to call:\n\n![](<../../images/image (704).png>)\n\nThen, when you start debugging **the execution will be stopped\
  \ when each DLL is loaded**, then, when rundll32 load your DLL the execution will be stopped.\n\nBut, how can you get to\
  \ the code of the DLL that was lodaded? Using this method, I don't know how.\n\n### Using x64dbg/x32dbg\n\n- **Load rundll32**\
  \ (64bits in C:\\Windows\\System32\\rundll32.exe and 32 bits in C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\rundll32.exe)\n- **Change the Command\
  \ Line** ( _File --> Change Command Line_ ) and set the path of the dll and the function that you want to call, for example:\
  \ \"C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\rundll32.exe\" \"Z:\\shared\\Cybercamp\\rev2\\\\\\14.ridii_2.dll\",DLLMain\n- Change _Options\
  \ --> Settings_ and select \"**DLL Entry**\".\n- Then **start the execution**, the debugger will stop at each dll main,\
  \ at some point you will **stop in the dll Entry of your dll**. From there, just search for the points where you want to\
  \ put a breakpoint.\n\nNotice that when the execution is stopped by any reason in win64dbg you can see **in which code you\
  \ are** looking in the **top of the win64dbg window**:\n\n![](<../../images/image (842).png>)\n\nThen, looking to this ca\
  \ see when the execution was stopped in the dll you want to debug.\n\n## GUI Apps / Videogames\n\n[**Cheat Engine**](https://www.cheatengine.org/downloads.php)\
  \ is a useful program to find where important values are saved inside the memory of a running game and change them. More\
  \ info in:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\ncheat-engine.md\n{{#endref}}\n\n[**PiNCE**](https://github.com/korcankaraokcu/PINCE) is a front-end/reverse\
  \ engineering tool for the GNU Project Debugger (GDB), focused on games. However, it can be used for any reverse-engineering\
  \ related stuff\n\n[**Decompiler Explorer**](https://dogbolt.org/) is a web front-end to a number of decompilers. This web\
  \ service lets you compare the output of different decompilers on small executables.\n\n## ARM & MIPS\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nhttps://github.com/nongiach/arm_now\n\
  {{#endref}}\n\n## Shellcodes\n\n### Debugging a shellcode with blobrunner\n\n[**Blobrunner**](https://github.com/OALabs/BlobRunner)\
  \ will **allocate** the **shellcode** inside a space of memory, will **indicate** you the **memory address** were the shellcode\
  \ was allocated and will **stop** the execution.\\\nThen, you need to **attach a debugger** (Ida or x64dbg) to the process\
  \ and put a **breakpoint the indicated memory address** and **resume** the execution. This way you will be debugging the\
  \ shellcode.\n\nThe releases github page contains zips containing the compiled releases: [https://github.com/OALabs/BlobRunner/releases/tag/v0.0.5](https://github.com/OALabs/BlobRunner/releases/tag/v0.0.5)\\\
  \nYou can find a slightly modified version of Blobrunner in the following link. In order to compile it just **create a C/C++\
  \ project in Visual Studio Code, copy and paste the code and build it**.\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nblobrunner.md\n{{#endref}}\n\n###\
  \ Debugging a shellcode with jmp2it\n\n[**jmp2it** ](https://github.com/adamkramer/jmp2it/releases/tag/v1.4)is very similar\
  \ to blobrunner. It will **allocate** the **shellcode** inside a space of memory, and start an **eternal loop**. You then\
  \ need to **attach the debugger** to the process, **play start wait 2-5 secs and press stop** and you will find yourself\
  \ inside the **eternal loop**. Jump to the next instruction of the eternal loop as it will be a call to the shellcode, and\
  \ finally you will find yourself executing the shellcode.\n\n![](<../../images/image (509).png>)\n\nYou can download a compiled\
  \ version of [jmp2it inside the releases page](https://github.com/adamkramer/jmp2it/releases/).\n\n### Debugging shellcode\
  \ using Cutter\n\n[**Cutter**](https://github.com/rizinorg/cutter/releases/tag/v1.12.0) is the GUI of radare. Using cutter\
  \ you can emulate the shellcode and inspect it dynamically.\n\nNote that Cutter allows you to \"Open File\" and \"Open Shellcode\"\
  . In my case when I opened the shellcode as a file it decompiled it correctly, but when I opened it as a shellcode it didn't:\n\
  \n![](<../../images/image (562).png>)\n\nIn order to start the emulation in the place you want to, set a bp there and apparently\
  \ cutter will automatically start the emulation from there:\n\n![](<../../images/image (589).png>)\n\n![](<../../images/image\
  \ (387).png>)\n\nYou can see the stack for example inside a hex dump:\n\n![](<../../images/image (186).png>)\n\n### Deobfuscating\
  \ shellcode and getting executed functions\n\nYou should try [**scdbg**](http://sandsprite.com/blogs/index.php?uid=7&pid=152).\\\
  \nIt will tell you things like **which functions** is the shellcode using and if the shellcode is **decoding** itself in\
  \ memory.\n\n```bash\nscdbg.exe -f shellcode # Get info\nscdbg.exe -f shellcode -r #show analysis report at end of run\n\
  scdbg.exe -f shellcode -i -r #enable interactive hooks (file and network) and show analysis report at end of run\nscdbg.exe\
  \ -f shellcode -d #Dump decoded shellcode\nscdbg.exe -f shellcode /findsc #Find offset where starts\nscdbg.exe -f shellcode\
  \ /foff 0x0000004D #Start the executing in that offset\n```\n\nscDbg also counts with a graphical launcher where you can\
  \ select the options you want and execute the shellcode\n\n![](<../../images/image (258).png>)\n\nThe **Create Dump** option\
  \ will dump the final shellcode if any change is done to the shellcode dynamically in memory (useful to download the decoded\
  \ shellcode). The **start offset** can be useful to start the shellcode at a specific offset. The **Debug Shell** option\
  \ is useful to debug the shellcode using the scDbg terminal (however I find any of the options explained before better for\
  \ this matter as you will be able to use Ida or x64dbg).\n\n### Disassembling using CyberChef\n\nUpload your shellcode file\
  \ as input and use the following recipe to decompile it: [https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=To_Hex('Space',0)Disassemble_x86('32','Full%20x86%20architecture',16,0,true,true)](<https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/index.html#recipe=To_Hex('Space',0)Disassemble_x86('32','Full%20x86%20architecture',16,0,true,true)>)\n\
  \n## MBA obfuscation deobfuscation\n\n**Mixed Boolean-Arithmetic (MBA)** obfuscation hides simple expressions such as `x\
  \ + y` behind formulas that mix arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`) and bitwise operators (`&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, shifts). The important\
  \ part is that these identities are usually only correct under **fixed-width modular arithmetic**, so carries and overflows\
  \ matter:\n\n```c\n(x ^ y) + 2 * (x & y) == x + y\n```\n\nIf you simplify this kind of expression with generic algebra tooling\
  \ you can easily get a wrong result because the bit-width semantics were ignored.\n\n### Practical workflow\n\n1. **Keep\
  \ the original bit-width** from the lifted code/IR/decompiler output (`8/16/32/64` bits).\n2. **Classify the expression**\
  \ before trying to simplify it:\n   - **Linear**: weighted sums of bitwise atoms\n   - **Semilinear**: linear plus constant\
  \ masks such as `x & 0xFF`\n   - **Polynomial**: products appear\n   - **Mixed**: products and bitwise logic are interleaved,\
  \ often with repeated subexpressions\n3. **Verify every candidate rewrite** with random testing or an SMT proof. If the\
  \ equivalence cannot be proven, keep the original expression instead of guessing.\n\n### CoBRA\n\n[**CoBRA**](https://github.com/trailofbits/CoBRA)\
  \ is a practical MBA simplifier for malware analysis and protected-binary reversing. It classifies the expression and routes\
  \ it through specialized pipelines instead of applying one generic rewrite pass to everything.\n\nQuick usage:\n\n```bash\n\
  # Recover arithmetic from a logic-heavy MBA\ncobra-cli --mba \"(x&y)+(x|y)\"\n# x + y\n\n# Preserve fixed-width wraparound\
  \ semantics\ncobra-cli --mba \"(x&0xFF)+(x&0xFF00)\" --bitwidth 16\n# x\n\n# Ask CoBRA to prove the rewrite with Z3\ncobra-cli\
  \ --mba \"(a^b)+(a&b)+(a&b)\" --verify\n```\n\nUseful cases:\n\n- **Linear MBA**: CoBRA evaluates the expression on Boolean\
  \ inputs, derives a signature, and races several recovery methods such as pattern matching, ANF conversion, and coefficient\
  \ interpolation.\n- **Semilinear MBA**: constant-masked atoms are rebuilt with bit-partitioned reconstruction so masked\
  \ regions remain correct.\n- **Polynomial/Mixed MBA**: products are decomposed into cores and repeated subexpressions can\
  \ be lifted into temporaries before simplifying the outer relation.\n\nExample of a mixed identity commonly worth trying\
  \ to recover:\n\n```c\n(x & y) * (x | y) + (x & ~y) * (~x & y)\n```\n\nThis can collapse to:\n\n```c\nx * y\n```\n\n###\
  \ Reversing notes\n\n- Prefer running CoBRA on **lifted IR expressions** or decompiler output after you isolated the exact\
  \ computation.\n- Use `--bitwidth` explicitly when the expression came from masked arithmetic or narrow registers.\n- If\
  \ you need a stronger proof step, check the local Z3 notes here:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\nsatisfiability-modulo-theories-smt-z3.md\n\
  {{#endref}}\n\n- CoBRA also ships as an **LLVM pass plugin** (`libCobraPass.so`), which is useful when you want to normalize\
  \ MBA-heavy LLVM IR before later analysis passes.\n- Unsupported carry-sensitive mixed-domain residuals should be treated\
  \ as a signal to keep the original expression and reason about the carry path manually.\n\n## [Movfuscator](https://github.com/xoreaxeaxeax/movfuscator)\n\
  \nThis obfuscator **modifies all the instructions for `mov`**(yeah, really cool). It also uses interruptions to change executions\
  \ flows. For more information about how does it works:\n\n- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VF_wPkiBJY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VF_wPkiBJY)\n\
  - [https://github.com/xoreaxeaxeax/movfuscator/blob/master/slides/domas_2015_the_movfuscator.pdf](https://github.com/xoreaxeaxeax/movfuscator/blob/master/slides/domas_2015_the_movfuscator.pdf)\n\
  \nIf you are lucky [demovfuscator](https://github.com/kirschju/demovfuscator) will deofuscate the binary. It has several\
  \ dependencies\n\n```\napt-get install libcapstone-dev\napt-get install libz3-dev\n```\n\nAnd [install keystone](https://github.com/keystone-engine/keystone/blob/master/docs/COMPILE-NIX.md)\
  \ (`apt-get install cmake; mkdir build; cd build; ../make-share.sh; make install`)\n\nIf you are playing a **CTF, this workaround\
  \ to find the flag** could be very useful: [https://dustri.org/b/defeating-the-recons-movfuscator-crackme.html](https://dustri.org/b/defeating-the-recons-movfuscator-crackme.html)\n\
  \n## Rust\n\nTo find the **entry point** search the functions by `::main` like in:\n\n![](<../../images/image (1080).png>)\n\
  \nIn this case the binary was called authenticator, so it's pretty obvious that this is the interesting main function.\\\
  \nHaving the **name** of the **functions** being called, search for them on the **Internet** to learn about their **inputs**\
  \ and **outputs**.\n\n## **Delphi**\n\nFor Delphi compiled binaries you can use [https://github.com/crypto2011/IDR](https://github.com/crypto2011/IDR)\n\
  \nIf you have to reverse a Delphi binary I would suggest you to use the IDA plugin [https://github.com/Coldzer0/IDA-For-Delphi](https://github.com/Coldzer0/IDA-For-Delphi)\n\
  \nJust press **ATL+f7** (import python plugin in IDA) and select the python plugin.\n\nThis plugin will execute the binary\
  \ and resolve function names dynamically at the start of the debugging. After starting the debugging press again the Start\
  \ button (the green one or f9) and a breakpoint will hit in the beginning of the real code.\n\nIt is also very interesting\
  \ because if you press a button in the graphic application the debugger will stop in the function executed by that bottom.\n\
  \n## Golang\n\nIf you have to reverse a Golang binary I would suggest you to use the IDA plugin [https://github.com/sibears/IDAGolangHelper](https://github.com/sibears/IDAGolangHelper)\n\
  \nJust press **ATL+f7** (import python plugin in IDA) and select the python plugin.\n\nThis will resolve the names of the\
  \ functions.\n\n## Compiled Python\n\nIn this page you can find how to get the python code from an ELF/EXE python compiled\
  \ binary:\n\n\n{{#ref}}\n../../generic-methodologies-and-resources/basic-forensic-methodology/specific-software-file-type-tricks/.pyc.md\n\
  {{#endref}}\n\n## GBA - Game Body Advance\n\nIf you get the **binary** of a GBA game you can use different tools to **emulate**\
  \ and **debug** it:\n\n- [**no$gba**](https://problemkaputt.de/gba.htm) (_Download the debug version_) - Contains a debugger\
  \ with interface\n- [**mgba** ](https://mgba.io)- Contains a CLI debugger\n- [**gba-ghidra-loader**](https://github.com/pudii/gba-ghidra-loader)\
  \ - Ghidra plugin\n- [**GhidraGBA**](https://github.com/SiD3W4y/GhidraGBA) - Ghidra plugin\n\nIn [**no$gba**](https://problemkaputt.de/gba.htm),\
  \ in _**Options --> Emulation Setup --> Controls**_** ** you can see how to press the Game Boy Advance **buttons**\n\n![](<../../images/image\
  \ (581).png>)\n\nWhen pressed, each **key has a value** to identify it:\n\n```\nA = 1\nB = 2\nSELECT = 4\nSTART = 8\nRIGHT\
  \ = 16\nLEFT = 32\nUP = 64\nDOWN = 128\nR = 256\nL = 256\n```\n\nSo, in this kind of program, the interesting part will\
  \ be **how the program treats the user input**. In the address **0x4000130** you will find the commonly found function:\
  \ **KEYINPUT**.\n\n![](<../../images/image (447).png>)\n\nIn the previous image you can find that the function is called\
  \ from **FUN_080015a8** (addresses: _0x080015fa_ and _0x080017ac_).\n\nIn that function, after some init operations (without\
  \ any importance):\n\n```c\nvoid FUN_080015a8(void)\n\n{\n  ushort uVar1;\n  undefined4 uVar2;\n  undefined4 uVar3;\n  ushort\
  \ uVar4;\n  int iVar5;\n  ushort *puVar6;\n  undefined *local_2c;\n\n  DISPCNT = 0x1140;\n  FUN_08000a74();\n  FUN_08000ce4(1);\n\
  \  DISPCNT = 0x404;\n  FUN_08000dd0(&DAT_02009584,0x6000000,&DAT_030000dc);\n  FUN_08000354(&DAT_030000dc,0x3c);\n  uVar4\
  \ = DAT_030004d8;\n```\n\nIt's found this code:\n\n```c\n  do {\n    DAT_030004da = uVar4; //This is the last key pressed\n\
  \    DAT_030004d8 = KEYINPUT | 0xfc00;\n    puVar6 = &DAT_0200b03c;\n    uVar4 = DAT_030004d8;\n    do {\n      uVar2 =\
  \ DAT_030004dc;\n      uVar1 = *puVar6;\n      if ((uVar1 & DAT_030004da & ~uVar4) != 0) {\n```\n\nThe last if is checking\
  \ **`uVar4`** is in the **last Keys** and not is the current key, also called letting go off a button (current key is stored\
  \ in **`uVar1`**).\n\n```c\n        if (uVar1 == 4) {\n          DAT_030000d4 = 0;\n          uVar3 = FUN_08001c24(DAT_030004dc);\n\
  \          FUN_08001868(uVar2,0,uVar3);\n          DAT_05000000 = 0x1483;\n          FUN_08001844(&DAT_0200ba18);\n    \
  \      FUN_08001844(&DAT_0200ba20,&DAT_0200ba40);\n          DAT_030000d8 = 0;\n          uVar4 = DAT_030004d8;\n      \
  \  }\n        else {\n          if (uVar1 == 8) {\n            if (DAT_030000d8 == 0xf3) {\n              DISPCNT = 0x404;\n\
  \              FUN_08000dd0(&DAT_02008aac,0x6000000,&DAT_030000dc);\n              FUN_08000354(&DAT_030000dc,0x3c);\n \
  \             uVar4 = DAT_030004d8;\n            }\n          }\n          else {\n            if (DAT_030000d4 < 8) {\n\
  \              DAT_030000d4 = DAT_030000d4 + 1;\n              FUN_08000864();\n              if (uVar1 == 0x10) {\n   \
  \             DAT_030000d8 = DAT_030000d8 + 0x3a;\n```\n\nIn the previous code you can see that we are comparing **uVar1**\
  \ (the place where the **value of the pressed button** is) with some values:\n\n- First, it's compared with the **value\
  \ 4** (**SELECT** button): In the challenge this button clears the screen\n- Then, it's comparing it with the **value 8**\
  \ (**START** button): In the challenge this checks is the code is valid to get the flag.\n  - In this case the var **`DAT_030000d8`**\
  \ is compared with 0xf3 and if the value is the same some code is executed.\n- In any other cases, some cont (`DAT_030000d4`)\
  \ is checked. It's a cont because it's adding 1 right after entering in the code.\\\n  **I**f less than 8 something that\
  \ involves **adding** values to **`DAT_030000d8`** is done (basically it's adding the values of the keys pressed in this\
  \ variable as long as the cont is less than 8).\n\nSo, in this challenge, knowing the values of the buttons, you needed\
  \ to **press a combination with a length smaller than 8 that the resulting addition is 0xf3.**\n\n**Reference for this tutorial:**\
